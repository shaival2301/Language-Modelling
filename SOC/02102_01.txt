SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate Chamber
and took his seat upon the Throne. His
Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and that
House being come, with their Speaker, His
Excellency was pleased to open the Second
Session of the Twenty-first Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The conference with representatives of the provincial governments forecast in my speech closing
your last session was held in January. This conference marked a promising beginning In working

out a satisfactory procedure for making within
Canada whatever amendments to the constitution
may from time to time be required. Agreement
was reached on certain general principles and a
continuing committee was established to further the
work of the conference.
The governments of all the provinces have also
been invited to participate in a general conference
between the federal and provincial governments
early next autumn to consider other matters of
mutual concern. The several provincial authorities
have been asked to make suggestions as to the principal topics they will wish to have discussed at this
conference.
In the meantime negotiations are proceeding
with the provincial governments for the implementation of the legislation adopted at your last session
respecting housing, a transcontinental highway and
forest conservation.
The National Health Program has been extended
to the province of Newfoundland and further
satisfactory progress has been made, In co-operation with the provinces generally, in the development of ,more adequate health facilities and services.
In the international sphere, our country continues
to give full support to the charter of the United
Nations. A Canadian delegation is now attending
a session of the Economic and Social Council to
which Canada was elected at the last session of
the General Assembly.
The recent conference in Ceylon of the foreign
ministers of the nations of the commonwealth
demonstrated that there is a continuing and substantial community of ottlook among the nations
of the commonwealth both in the East and the
West in their approach to current problems of
foreign affairs.
The measures for the preservation of peace and
the restoration and maintenance of prosperity contemplated by the North Atlantic treaty are being
devised and applied as expeditiously as circumstances permit. The wholehearted co-operation of
all the signatories to the treaty is encouraging
evidence of their determination to deter aggression
by a combination of actual and potential strength
calculated to remove the possibility of successful
aggression.
The cold war nevertheless still continues and
imposes on all the free nations heavy burdens for
the provision of defence forces and modern armaments. Preparedness to meet any sudden onslaught
is essential and the means must be provided. But
the free nations also face a test of endurance, and
our staying power could be endangered by attempting to achieve complete preparedness at the expense
of Our adaptability to new developments in weapons
and techniques of warfare or the efficiency of gur
social and industrial systems.
In the development of Canada's defence forces,
constant attention is being given to the best use of
our resources, to the encouragement of joint research and experimental development and to the
co-ordination of Canadian efforts with those of the
other signatories of the North Atlantic treaty.
The measure to consolidate existing legislation
respecting our defence forces and to provide for a
purely Canadian disciplinary code to be made
applicable to ail the forces will be re-introduced.

SENATE
Employment and prosperity remain at a high level
in Canada. The prospects are good for continued
private investment in construction and capital
development throughout the presen1t year. The demand for consumer goods of all kinds continues to
be strong. However, seasonal and local factors
have given rise to a significant amount of
temporary regional unemployment during the past
few months, and the security provisions established
under unemployment insurance legislation have
been called upon to meet the first important test
since they were brought into effect.
Although a high proportion of persons temporarily
unemployed are actually in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, you will be asked to give
consideration to a bill to widen the scope and
extend the benefits of unemployment insurance.
Circumstances outside Canada have been responsible for some downward adjustment in the price
of farm' products. Measures have already been
taken to reduce the impact of these adjustments.
In order to provide authority for continuing price
support to that end for the primary products of our
farms and fisheries, you will be asked to amend
the Agricultural Products Act, the Agricultural
Prices Support Act and the Fisheries Prices
Support Act.
Within the past year, the International Wheat
Agreement has been brought into operation. In
view of Canada's participation in that agreement
and the recent decision to market coarse grains
through the Canadian Wheat Board, you will also be
asked to consider a measure to renew the existing
powers of the board.
During the past year Canadian exports were
maintained at close to record levels, but continued difficulties arising out of the world-wide
dollar shortage have resulted recently in reduced
purchases of a number of cur export products.
Canadian representatives continue to participate
actively in co-ordinated international efforts to
bring about improvement in the underlying conditions of world trade. The government is also pursuing policies designed to develop new markets for
our products and to assist overseas customers to
increase Canadian earnings. My ministers will
continue their efforts to secure reductions in trade
barriers.
To this end preparations are actively
under way for further multilateral trade negotiations later in the present year.
While prevailing exchange difficulties will require
continued readjustments, we have reason to expect
that our export trade as a whole will remain at a
high level during the present year.
You will be asked to give consideration to the
legislation required to implement the policy concerning the control and the orderly decontrol of
rents announced by the government during your
last session.
A measure will be introduced to amend the
Canada Shipping Act to incorporate changes suggested by the Safety of Life at Sea Convention of
1948 and to define duties of Canadian consuls and
conditions of registration in Canada of Canadian
ships.
You will be asked to consider a bill for the
revision of the Indian Act.
n bill will be submitted to substitute a uniform
an
systematic procedure for existing legislation
concerning publication and tabling in parliament
of regulations and orders made by the Governor in
Council or Ministers or other agents of the Crown
in the exercise of powers conferred by statute.

Bills will be introduced to implement the policies
announced at the last session respecting prize
money; the inclusion of veterans of British and
allied forces within the scope of the War Veterans
Allowance Act; and grants to municipalities in
which there ls an exceptional concentration of
federal property.
Other measures requiring your consideration will
include bills to amend the Militia Pension Act; the
Criminal Code ;the Government Annuities Act; the
Post Office Act; the Consolidated Revenue and
Audit Act; the Currency Act; the Trust Companies
Act; the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, 1932; the Foreign Insurance Companies Act,
1932; the Customs Act; the Maritime Marshland
Rehabilitation Act; and the Northwest Territories
Power Commission Act.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make provision for all
essential services for the next fiscal year.

In 1921 he was elected to the House of
Commons, and was re-elected in the general

It is inevitable, of course, that in a house
such as ours, with a membership of upwards
of one hundred, there should exist different
degrees of intimacy between colleagues. I
cannot claim that I knew our late colleague
as intimately as others, but I remember quite
well that when I was first appointed to the
Senate, and later when I assumed the
responsibility of the position which I now
hold, the late Senator St. Père was one of the
first to extend his good wishes.
Senator St. Père had a wide circle of
friends, was particularly interested in the welfare of the younger generation, and during
his long and active political career was most
attentive to the interests of those he represented. He was a faithful attendant at meetings of the Senate and was exceedingly well
versed in public affairs. He will be greatly
missed by the many who knew him so well.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
in the death of Senator Sinclair I feel as if
I had lost one of my very dear friends from
this chamber. When I came to the Senate
some fifteen years ago he was one of the first
members I got to know, because I had the
pleasure and honour of knowing his married
sister in Winnipeg, who for many years was
my next-door neighbour. Even though he
was on an opposite side of the house from
me, I felt that in him at least I had a friend
on whom I could depend. The years that
followed taught me that John Sinclair did
not take a stand on any question unless he
thoroughly believed in it himself and thoroughly believed also that it was in the best
interest of not only Prince Edward Island
but of all Canada.
As has already been pointed out, he served
as Chairman of the Finance Committee, but
so far as I am concerned and so far as my

colleague on my left (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is
concerned, the most outstanding service that
he rendered here was on the Divorce Committee. That committee is constantly being
battered about in this chamber and in another
place, and it was always good to know that
we could depend upon John Sinclair being

present at the committee's sittings every
Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday
morning, to do his job there and do it well.
It is members such as John Sinclair who
make this house what it is. They come here
determined to give service to their own provinces and to Canada as a whole. I am sure
that all my colleagues and I will miss him
very much indeed. His widow and his family may well feel proud of the important
work he did for Canada over a long period
of years as a member of the House of Commons and of the Senate.
As to the late Senator St. Père, it was an
unusual kind of friendship that developed
between him and me. After a sitting of the
Senate I used to love to drop into his room
and listen to his conversation. He was interested in sports. So am I. And when he was
in his place here and I had the pleasure of
speaking, I was always sure of an ardent
listener-especially if I spoke on the subject
of rent control. I do not say that he took
a very active part in the debates of this
house, nor do I suppose that he took a very
active part in the debates of another place;
nevertheless he will be greatly missed, for he
loved his country, and he thought that by
training young men and young women in
amateur sport he was making a great contribution. I entirely agreed with him. All
Canada is indebted to the province of Quebec
for the valuable service performed by this
son of hers in stimulating interest on the
part of young men and young women in
sports and other healthful physical activities. I do not believe the juvenile courts
would have so much work to do if the people
of Canada realized that young people of the
age of fifteen years and up, who have the
energy for sports and do not participate in
them, are very apt to fall into undesirable
habits.
Hon. James P. McIntyre: Honourable
senators, as the government leader has just
told us, since we last met we have lost two
highly respected members of this house, in
the persons of Senator St. Père and Senator
John E. Sinclair, one from the province of
Quebec, and one from Prince Edward Island.
Prince Edward Island has produced some
outstanding public men, but I think I can
truthfully say that none were more outstanding than John Ewen Sinclair. His long political service to his native province and to
Canada will forever stand as a monument to
his memory.
The late senator was a member of the
United Church at Summerfield and was
superintendent of the Sunday school in that
community. He was a member of the
Masonic Order, and gave to it many years of
useful service.

FEBRUARY 21, 1950
Senator Sinclair entered politics in his
native province in 1908; he was elected to
the House of Commons in 1917, and in 1930
was summoned to the Senate. He stood high
in the councils of his party, and will be
greatly missed in political circles. However,
the late Senator never allowed his political
differences to mar his friendship with anyone with whom he came in contact. His wide
circle of friends extended far beyond the
confines of his community and the boundaries
of his province. His long career in parliament made him known in all parts of the
Dominion.
He was endowed with keen judgment, and
his advice was often sought. No one stood
higher in the estimation of the members of
this chamber than did Senator John E.
Sinclair; but while all here mourn the loss of
an esteemed colleague, I personally have lost
a true and loyal friend.
I extend my sincere sympathy to the
bereaved wife and family in their loss of a
beloved husband and father and a loyal servant of the people of Canada.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I wish to pay a brief tribute of respect to my
dear friend Senator John Sinclair, who passed
away since we last met.
Senator Sinclair was one of the first
senators I met when I came to Ottawa some
sixteen years ago. He was keenly interested
in agriculture, and so was I. We became close
friends, and I thought a great deal of his
sound judgment and good common sense.
Later we sat together on the Divorce Committee. Senator Sinclair sat to my right, and I
always considered him my right-hand man.
I always found his judgment to be of the
very best. I was particularly pleased with
him because be never voted against the
Chairman.
Though I knew Senator Sinclair was not
feeling well, his passing, following so closely
the death of his room-mate the late Senator
Copp, shocked me very much.
I extend to the wife, the family and the
relatives of our late colleague my deepest and
most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADflRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the Second Session
of the Twenty-First Parliament of Canada.
Hon. William Henry Golding moved:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:To His Excellency Field Marshal The Right Honcurable Viscount Alexander of Tunis, Knight of the

Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight Grand
Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath,
Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order
of Saint Michael and Saint George, Companion of
the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, upon
whom has been conferred the Decoration of the
Military Cross, one of His Majesty's Aides-de-Camp
General, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief
in and over Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in parliament assembled, beg
leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious speech which Your Excellency has
addressed to both houses of parliament.

He said:
Honourable senators, in proposing this
resolution I should like at the outset to
express my thanks to the leader of the government for the honour which I feel has been
conferred upon me in being asked to perform
this historic function. Down through the
years, in both houses of parliament, it has
always been considered an honour and a
privilege to be chosen to discharge this very
pleasant duty. But one cannot undertake a
task like this without some apprehension, and
some feeling of inferiority, perhaps, when one
thinks of the many able and competent parliamentarians who, during the past eighty
years and more, have performed a similar
function. One can only try to follow their
example and endeavour to discharge one's
duties and responsibilities to the best of one's
ability.
I feel also, in having been chosen to perform this duty, that an honour has been conferred upon my section of Western Ontario,
particularly the counties of Huron and Perth,
parts of which I had the honour to represent
for many years in another place. Having been
born in Perth county, where I spent many
years on a farm, and later having settled in
the town of Seaforth, Huron county, I am
by birth a native of Perth county and by
adoption a resident of Huron county, and I
know them very well indeed.
They are both exceptionally fine counties.
The people there are frugal and industrious,
and have always made a real contribution to
the welfare of their community and of the
nation. As honourable senators probably
know, these counties are largely agricultural,
containing choice, fertile land and, therefore,
exceptionally fine farms which produce splendid crops and are stocked with the choicest
breeds of animals produced on our Canadian
farms. Over the years, and particularly during the war periods, this area bas produced
tremendous quantities of high quality foodstuffs. It also contains many fine industries
which are making a worthwhile contribution
to the Canadian economy. Speaking generally, our people are good citizens in every

SENATE

respect. They are kind and generous; and
they are good Christian folk who will give
little consideration to any of the "isms" by
means of which it is sought to supplant
Christianity with materialism. I am sure
that any visitors to our district will invariably
receive a kindly welcome; and naturally it is
my personal feeling that those who have not
had the privilege of visiting it have missed
a good deal. I could say much more in praise
of our section of the province, which extends
as far as Lake Huron, but I do not wish to
use an occasion of this kind to do any boosting of our particular district. I may be
allowed however, to add that I regard it as
a privilege and an honour to have had the
opportunity of representing such a splendid
district, and such admirable people.
It seems to me that at the opening of this
session it is right and proper that we should
pause to pay our tribute of loyalty and affection to His Majesty the King, and to his
gracious consort Queen Elizabeth. We have
always appreciated and admired the sincerity
which has characterized Their Majesties in
the discharge of the duties of their high office.
This quality, and their kindness to their
people, have touched our hearts in a very
definite way. I am sure that every Canadian
citizen is most happy to know that His
Majesty is gradually recovering from the
serious physical disorder from which he was
We shall never forget Their
suffering.
Majesties' visit to this country in 1939, and
we look forward hopefully to their return.
On that occasion they established, I believe,
a record, in that never before had a reigning
monarch paid a visit to one of the nations of
the British Empire.
I think that we as Canadians, are also
interested in Prince Charles, born to Her
Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth and the
Duke of Edinburgh on November 14, 1948,
and that we shall all look forward with interest to the growth and development of this
young prince.
Having expressed our thanks to His Excellency the Governor General for his gracious
speech delivered to both Houses of Parliament, I should like to take the opportunity
of tendering to the Right Honourable
Viscount Alexander of Tunis, our Governor
General, and to Lady Alexander our sincere
appreciation of the very kind and most
efficient manner in which they are carrying
out the duties and the responsibilities of
their high office. They have, indeed, won our
hearts by their kindness and their helpfulness.
They have travelled across this country and
mingled with our people to such an extent
that they are favourably known and spoken
of from coast to coast. We would assure

them that we appreciate more than words can
express the excellent service which they are
rendering.
When the Allies finally won the terrible
conflict which is now known as World War
No. 2, all of us, I think, had high hopes that
the nations would settle down and together
endeavour to build a world of peace and good
will. But evidently that is not to be. Some
of the nations which were Allies in that grim
struggle are now divided against each other,
and this situation is forcing the western
nations to spend millions upon millions of
dollars on measures of security. Had peace
in our time really been an accomplished fact,
this money could have been spent as it should
have been, on the welfare of our people. But
in fact, as indicated in His Excellency's
Address, as a matter of self-preservation, our
defence estimates loom large. As peaceloving Canadians we regret the necessity of
spending these huge amounts for purposes of
this kind, but we must try to co-operate fully
with those who are united in the North
Atlantic pact, and stand firm to protect our
own freedom and our own way of life. For
why should any nation or any group,
through doctrines of materialism or their own
ideologies, try to drive out of our life or out
of our nation the things which are spiritual?
If we permit this to be done we shall start on
a downward course from which we may never
recover. I believe that any nation which
starts on such a course-though it may take
a little time-ends in disaster. Therefore, I
say, no matter how much we love peace, we
must never lower ourselves individually or
as a nation by failing to stand firm for what
we believe to be right.
Honourable senators, when we review the
leadership given to some of the other countries and realize the plight in which their
people now find themselves, it seems to me
that we should be extremely grateful for the
leadership we have enjoyed in Canada. Our
leaders in both houses of parliament have
not been content to devote their time and
energy to planning our material welfare
alone; in addition, they have had a high
sense of duty and responsibility in spiritual
matters. Time will not permit me to make
a general review of all who have served us
as leaders; but I think it is right and proper
to say that they have all been good men.
There have been differences of opinion
regarding matters which have affected our
internal economy, but fundamentally our
leaders have been sound and have always had
their feet on the ground.
I should like to say a few words about our
most recent leaders. Under the leadership of
the Right Honourable Mr. King, the Liberal

FEBRUARY
party in Canada accomplished many fine
things.
Mr. King himself established a
unique record by occupying the position of
Prime Minister of his country longer than
any other Prime Minister in the British
Empire. Mr. King was a good man in every
way; he was a man of peace; he possessed
exceptionally high ideals, and devoted his
life to trying to promote the best interests of
Canada. Not long ago he found it necessary
to retire from active participation in the
struggle to maintain the freedom, liberty and
welfare of Canadian citizens. We all owe
him a debt of gratitude, and in his retirement
we can certainly assure him that the job
which he undertook to do so many years ago
was done exceptionally well.
Honourable senators will recall that when
Mr. King announced his intention of retiring
there was for some time great speculation as
to who would take his place. Then that fine,
cultured, Christian gentleman, the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent offered his services
to his country. I am sure that every one of
us who has any knowledge of these matters
realizes that this step meant a tremendous
personal sacrifice to Mr. St. Laurent. He
was received with confidence by our people
and took his place as the first citizen of
Canada, ready to carry on where his predecessor had left off. And what a remarkably fine job he is doing as our Prime
Minister! He is demonstrating that he is an
excellent administrator; and our people can
rest assured that under his leadership the
government will do its utmost to give sound,
sensible business administration.
This chamber for many years enjoyed the
leadership of the late Right Honourable
Senator Dandurand, a gentleman who was
always honest and conscientious in the discharge of his duties. But time marches on,
and he was suddenly called to his reward.
His place was taken by our good friend
and colleague, the honourable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson), another
thorough gentleman and one who has devoted
much of his life to the service of his country,
both in public aff airs and in the armed forces.
His ability, kindness and courtesy have won
for him the confidence and respect of honourable senators as well as that of the Prime
Minister and his cabinet, and of Canadians
generally.
In the leader of the opposition in this
chamber (Hon. Mr. Haig), we have another
kind, friendly and honest gentleman, one who
has devoted many- years of his life to the
service of his country, and is still making a
worthwhile contribution in his present
position.

21, 1950
What I have said about the leader of the
opposition in this chamber may be said about
the leaders of the opposition in another place.
So, I repeat, that as Canadians we should be
more than grateful «for the leadership we
have been given. Our leaders have set an
example for those in other countries to
follow, and I am quite sure that had this
example been followed the sacrifices that
have been made would not have been
required, and today we would be living in
a world of peace and good will.
Honourable senators, except for the odd
black spot, of which I am sure honourable
senators are aware, what I have said about
our leaders may also be said about the
membership in both houses of parliament. I
particularly wish my words of commendation
to apply to the lady members in this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Honourable senators, in
trying to assist in the conduct of the
business of this nation we can never hope to
be entirely free from disturbing and perplexing problems, and we now find ourselves confronted with the serious problem of
trying to establish suitable markets for the
products of our basic industries. Owing to
our exchange situation and the present disturbed conditions of world trade, we now find
that the markets we tried so hard to cultivate
are not as secure as we expected they would
be. So we must be patient and endeavour to
make contacts in other markets and find new
outlets for our products. I am optimistic
enough to believe that these outlets will be
found. Scientists are repeatedly telling us
that because the population of the world is
increasing so rapidly and the productivity of
the soil is deteriorating so much the people
of the world may be facing a condition of
starvation in the not too distant future. It is
a fact that millions of people are already
facing starvation; so I sincerely hope that
some way or other will be found to get our
splendid food products to these suffering
people.
In any event, it is especially important that
markets be found for our products, particularly our farm products. Our farmers
today are equipped to produce tremendous
quantities of fine quality foods, and as an
indication of how they have been trying to
put themselves in this position I need only
point out that during the last three years
they spent on machinery and equipment some
$504 million, whereas only about $450 million
was spent for the same purpose in the preceding nine years.
It is essential to our whole economy, I submit, that agricultural products be marketed

SENATE
at a price that will give producers a reasonable profit. Personally I believe we should
do everything possible always to keep agriculture, our basic industry, in a sound,
healthy, prosperous condition. I am glad to
note from His Excellency's address that some
attempt is going to be made to stabilize prices.
I believe that all our farmers expect prices
to come down, but at the moment the farmers
are being squeezed because, as always happens, the prices of their products are the
first to fall.
I am glad also to note from His Excellency's
address that attempts will be made to remove
trade barriers, so that we may have a freer
flow of trade. Such attempts are helpful. I
believe that expenditures which help to keep
agriculture prosperous are never wasted but,
on the contrary, are a good investment,
because agricultural prosperity is reflected in
increased business in other industries, and
this in turn means more employment and
more prosperity for all. On the other hand,
falling agricultural prices could easily start
an undesirable recession, with all its far-flung
ill effects.
I know, honourable senators, that during
the past decade there has been a good deal of
controversy about the prices at which our
farm products have been sold and the methods
adopted to sell them. I do not think we
should complain against people for engaging
in such controversy, if they believe some
political advantage can be obtained by doing
so, because, after all, constructive criticism
is necessary and in the interest of our whole
national life. But no useful purpose will be
served by spending too much time on these
arguments. We should remember that during
the sarne decade much water has passed under
our bridges, and to try to undo what has been
donc with regard to prices obtained for agricultural products or with regard to the
methods of selling them would be just as
futile as it would be to try to push back all
that water. I personally believe that those
who were charged with responsibility towards
our agricultural industry did try to do what
they believed to be in the best interest of
all concerned. One thing is sure, they had the
endorsation of parliament, and they have had
the endorsation of the people themselves.
I feel that Britain would be glad to purchase our products, if she were in a financial
position to do so. I therefore hope most sincerely that no unkind words will be spoken
by Canadians against Britain or by British
people against Canada. It should always be
remembered, and especially by those of us
who are trying to give public service, that
unkind words once spoken can never be
recalled, and usually they serve no useful
purpose.

Honourable senators, I do not know just
what the prevailing opinion across this country is, but it seems to me that those who in
any way represent the public cannot but view
with alarm the constant and ever-increasing
demands for more and more government services and government assistance of all kinds.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Golding: This growing tendency
of our people to expect the government to
solve all their problems, individual and otherwise, is gradually developing into the most
serious situation that our governments will
have to face. I may be wrong, but it seems
to me that in the younger days of most of us
in this chamber that was not the attitude of
the people. As a matter of fact, our forefathers, did not, in laying the foundation for
the building of this nation, hope or expect
that the government would meet all their
requirements and solve all their difficulties.
They believed that it was their duty and their
responsibility to provide for themselves and
their families, and they had faith and confidence in their ability to do that job better
than anyone else could do it for them. That
confidence in themselves gave them the courage, the initiative, the will and the vision to
lay the sound foundation on which they
expected our nation would continue to build.
It seems to me that that spirit must be reborn
in our people if we are to build the vigorous
nation of independent people that our forein
their day and
envisioned
fathers
generation.
In these times the government has to meet
many demands and many complaints. On the
one hand, people are demanding more and
more control and more and more government
action on this, that and the other thing; while,
on the other hand, people are complaining
about government regulations, control, inter-

ference with business, and so forth. Some of
our people seem to forget that the government has been trying to carry out a policy of
orderly decontrol. As a matter of fact there
is an almost continuous file of delegates and
delegations appearing before our government
or some of its members day after day. These
delegations represent various groups, organizations and individuals, and in the main all
are asking for government assistance, concessions or protection of some kind or another.
Unfortunately for the government there is a
great diversity of opinion between these different delegations. For instance, today representatives of the employees of our great railway systems may be asking for increased
wages and additional concessions, with fewer
hours of work, and tomorrow representatives
of the patrons of the roads may protest vigorously against any increase in freight rates or

FEBRUARY
other charges. There is the same conflict of
interest between labour organizations and
employers, and between civil service organizations and taxpayers. One day representatives of civil servants may demand increased
wages and changed working conditions, and
perhaps the next day organized groups of taxpayers will protest against our high rate of
taxes and insist that the government reduce
expenditures in every way.
These confiicting problems are continuously
being placed before the government, and my
feeling is that even more than the patience of
Job will be required if these problems are to
be untangled and solved to the satisfaction
of all. As a matter of fact, it cannot be done.
If we are to expect the government to
shoulder the full responsibility of providing
jobs, increased incomes and a high standard
of living for all, then we must concede to it
the power and authority to command and
dictate, to implement and carry out with
certainty and continuity all of the policies
which it believes will help in the solution of
the problem. I think it only reasonable that
authority go with responsibility. It is my
opinion, honourable Senators, that in these
modern times no government will exist for
long that does not provide some system of
social services for its people. The socialists
and similar groups are not the only ones
who believe in social welfare. On the contrary, free enterprise is just as anxious as
any other group to improve the lot of the
ordinary citizen. We are repeatedly told
that the real test of any political, economic
or social system is what that system does
for the ordinary man and woman. I agree
with those who contend that when that test
is applied to Canada it will be found that
our country stands high in the list of
countries whose citizens have shared in the
benefits of a highly developed civilization.
I believe that our government has gone all
out in an effort to meet the needs and wishes
of our people, but I often pause and wonder
how far we should go in the interests of
the people themselves, in encouraging them
to lean on the state and expect it to solve all
their problems, many of which they themselves could solve and be infinitely stronger
men and women by so doing.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Golding: In a young, vigorous
and undeveloped country like Canada we
can never hope to reach our highest destiny
if our people continually prefer to lean on
a beneficient or paternalistic government,
rather than exercise their own minds and
muscles in an atmosphere and spirit of freedom. We are told that our country today

21, 1950
is just at the beginning of its greatness, and
I think we will all agree with that. We
therefore need men and women who are
willing to work and exercise their skill and
ability in doing things for themselves, with
the expectation, of course, that they will
receive some reward.
There are some people in this countryperhaps in other countries too-who denounce
what is known as the profit system. They
think the system is bad, and they never miss
an opportunity to condemn it. They argue
that production should be for use and not
for profit. But one usually finds that these
people wish to apply that principle to everyone else but themselves. I think it reasonable that our people should have some incentive to encourage them to exert themselves
and induce them to put forth their best
efforts, whether it be in business or some
other occupation; and I know of no better
incentive than our profit system bas proven
to be.
I believe that Canadian citizens should
have confidence in themselves and in their
ability to do things for themselves. It is my
belief that they should have an ambition to
own a home of their own, to own a farm or
a business, to have an occupation or profession
of some sort which will ensure sufficient
income to provide for a family. Good
Canadian citizens, who are willing to exert
themselves consistently and qualify themselves for a position or some other means
of earning a living are, I contend, entitled
to some reward for their efforts. But if we
take the advice of some of our people and
deliberately destroy our profit system-a
system which has helped to build this country
-we will deprive all of an incentive which
has produced excellent results.
I disagree with such advice. It is my belief
that we should continue to build this country
in an atmosphere of freedom, where every
citizen has the right to select his own legal
method of earning his living. We must always
remember, however, that freedom should
never be used as a cloak for personal greed
or selfishness; nor should our profit system
be allowed to develop into a means of
exploitation. Freedom does not include the
right to exploit labour or to waste our natural
resources; neither does it include the right
to a monopoly, whether it be on the part of
the state, labour or free enterprise, for the
purpose of restricting production and increasing prices. How many times have we heard
the sound truth that a handful of men, or
even one man, conducting a business or acting
on behalif of labour, with no thought for the
rights of others, can create more public
resentment against our economic system and

SENATE

our method of doing things than can be overcome by a hundred thousand men guided by
humanitarian principles and sound business
ethics?
I think that the social services which we
have are good and helpful, but I believe the
whole system should be based on the ýassumption that our nation is just one big family.
In the old days a good Canadian family had
a keen sense of family responsibility, and
would do everything possible to try to take
care of any member of that family who was
not able to take care of himself; but such
people would rebel at being expected to take
care of someone who was able and competent
to look after himself. So it should be with
our nation: all able and competent citizens
should feel it a privilege and a duty to do
things for themselves and try to look after
themselves. Further, they should feel it their
duty to make some contribution to any system
by which the state endeavours to look after
those who through illness, blindness, or other
physical or mental defects, are not able to
look after themselves.
I believe that any permanent social security
plan we attempt to set up in this country
should be on a contributory basis; and I hope
that some scheme of this kind will be the
outcome of the conferences which are being
held between the provincial and federal
governments. The constant demands upon
the government to extend and increase services of all kinds involve, of course, tremendous additional expenditure, with resulting
increases in taxes. Careful consideration is
desirable lest the government undertake
expenditures that involve such an increase
in taxation as will impose upon businessmen
and farmers, wage earners and salaried
people, such deductions from income as will
make it impossible for them even to purchase
homes, whereupon, finding that they cannot
make any progress, they will become thoroughly frustrated and discouraged. I think
we all appreciate the position in which the
government finds itself. Our war debts must
be met; the administrative costs of this
country must be paid. We have pension plans,
social service schemes, and a multitude of
other projects, too numerous to mention, that
must be provided for. Yet, as I have
remarked, demands for more and more
expenditures, with resulting higher taxes, are
continually being made. I think the government should try to determine the extent of
the tax burdens which our people are able
to bear, and should hesitate long before going
beyond that point.
What I should like to emphasize at this
time, not with particular reference to honourable senators, but to all citizens of the
country, is that if we are to have a healthy,

happy, prosperous nation, we must make up
our minds to do our bit to bring about that
result. These things have to be worked for;
they do not just happen. We talk about the
wealth of the country. Let us remember
the simple truth that though there is wealth
in our hills, in our rich and fertile soil, in
our forests and rocks, in our mineral and
oil deposits, and in many other resources, it
can be extracted only by the labour of our
people. Governments have no magic pot of
gold from which to draw. The revenues with
which a government does things for people
come from those who work and toil to provide
for our basic needs; from those who, by
ingenuity and skill, manufacture what we
require; from business people; from professional people; and much of the revenue
comes from the ordinary individual, the
average citizen.
We are told that at the present time
developments are taking place which will
make Canada one of the world's outstanding
nations. I doubt whether any country offers
more freedom or more opportunity than this
country of ours. So that we, as Canadian
citizens, can go forward with hope and optimism, we should endeavour to cultivate the
closest unity and good will between all races
and creeds, and in particular, the two great
races of our country. I consider that my
parliamentary experience has been most
valuable in having brought me into close
relationship with fellow Canadians from our
neighbouring province of Quebec. I have
great admiration for these honourable colleagues in both houses of parliament. I have
always found them kind, courteous, honest
and sincere in their views, and determined,
by unity and good will, to make this Canada
of ours a country of which we can all be
proud.
I deeply appreciate this opportunity of
speaking from my place in this chamber.
Once again I would compliment honourable
members of the Senate for the very efficient
manner in which they conduct their business,
and upon the thorough study which is given
to bills sent to the various committees. As
members of the Senate we should endeavour
to co-operate in every way we can with the
other branch of parliament to give this
country the best possible legislation and
leadership. Personally, may I say, I have
found that the Senate is doing a much better
job and making a far greater contribution
to the business and the welfare of this
country than it is usually given credit for.
I hope we shall continue that good work.
Before I take my seat I should also like
to pay my tribute of respect to our departed
colleagues, the late Senators Sinclair and
St. Père. I always had a very high regard

FEBRUARY 21, 1950
for Senator Sinclair's ability and good sound
common sense. As to the late Senator St. Père,
for many years he and I were members
together in another place. At that time he
was very active in discharging his duties
and responsibilities as whip for the province
of Quebec. During all the years we were in
that place, and since, he was a frequent
visitor to my room, and I found in him an
excellent friend.
I should also take this opportunity of joining
with other honourable senators in extending
a welcome to our new colleague from St.
John's, Newfoundland (Hon. Mr. Burke). We
are very happy that his province has linked
itself with this dominion; and we wish for
him every success in his new field of service.
(Translation):
Hon. C. J. Veniot: Honourable senators, I
have the pleasure and great honour of seconding the motion of the honourable senator from
Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding) for the adoption of the Address to His Excellency, the
Governor General, in reply to the speech
from the throne. My first thought in addressing you is to congratulate most warmly my
honourable colleague for the skilful manner
in which he performed his task. You all
know that the honourable senator is not a
newcomer in the Canadian parliament, and I
cannot help but envy the ease with which he
takes part in the discussion of the most
important topics of the day.
I also wish to offer my most sincere thanks
to the right honourable the Prime Minister,
as well as to the leader of the government
in this house for the honour they have
bestowed on the population of my constituency in linking my name with that of the
mover of the address.
No doubt they also wanted to honour the
memory of two men who, for more than half a
century, played an important part in the political affairs of Gloucester and New Brunswick
and left their mark in those districts-I mean
first the one whose name I bear, whose place
I took in the House of Commons and to whom
was given the name of "Father of the bilingual postage stamp"-and also the late Senator
Onésiphore Turgeon, my immediate predecessor in this house and distinguished father of
two sons who also were outstanding in the
political affairs of Western Canada-my
friend the honourable senator from Caribooand his honour Justice Alphonse Turgeon,
Canadian ambassador to Ireland, and now
chairman of the Royal Commission on
Transportation.
It is the second time in less than a year
that the Prime Minister has cast his eyes
towards Gloucester county. You know of

course that last July, after an electoral campaign of unusual intensity followed by a
victory unprecedented in the annals of Canada, the Prime Minister travelled with his
family to the fine and pleasant beaches on the
south shore of the Baie des Chaleurs a few
miles from my home town of Bathurst, to
spend there three weeks of well-deserved
vacation. He found there all that a'man may
wish for his entertainment and rest: saltwater swimming on fine gray sand and
velvety beaches; cod and mackerel fishing in
the open sea; salmon and trout fishing in our
rivers and lakes; and, incidentally, I may say
that the catches were good and that the Prime
Minister showed himself as skilful in fishing
as in electioneering. Finally, he found in our
district a splendid golf course, pleasant walks
through enchanting scenery, first-class weather without extreme heat in the day-time
and with cool and restful nights.
Hundreds of people crowded at the station
to greet him on his arrival, but after this first
public demonstration, they carefully and
scrupulously respected his hours of rest and
completely refrained from visits, interviews
and receptions. He spent three Sundays in
our midst and it was after the parish mass at
the University of the Sacred Heart, the church
of Sainte-Famille de Bathurst-Ouest and the
church of Saint-Polycarpe du Petit-Rocher
that our people were able to enjoy his presence and show not only their admiration but
also their affection for this man who succeeded in winning so many hearts in every
part of Canada. It was in those moments of
intimacy with the good people of our parishes
that he revealed the greatness of his soul in
the most outstanding way through his frankness, simple manners and kindness towards
them.
We wholeheartedly thank our Prime Minister and repeat to him our sincere invitation to
visit us often.
The county of Gloucester, apart from its
charm for those who wish to spend a pleasant
vacation, offers many other attractions. Its
50,000 population-nine tenths of which are
of Acadian origin, forming thereby the largest
group of Acadians in America-engage especially in deep sea fishing, agriculture, lumbering, and paper-making in all its branches
including pulpwood.
For many years, our cod fishing schooners
formed one of the strongest fleets of the
Maritimes, fit to compete with the famous
Lunenburg fleet in Nova Scotia. Our fishermen of Caraquet, Shippigan, Lamèque and
Miscou always rank among the best on the
Atliantic coast. Their cold storage plants and
canneries place on the market some of the

SENATE
most varied and most delicious seafoods. The
Baie des Chaleurs salmon and lobster have
won a place of honour on the Canadian and
American markets. Each fall the markets of
eastern and central Canada are filled with our
Caraquet and Shippigan oysters and we have
earned first place among the Maritime Provinces for the production of this delicious
mollusc, Tor which there is such a great demand. In winter, our silver smelts are the
delight of Canadian and American gourmets.
Our various paper industries give work, in the
woods or in the plants, to 2,000 people. The
lumber industry is one of our greatest sources
of revenue. Finally, since a few years, we
have a brand new industry, the peat industry.
The important peat-bogs of the large plains of
Shippigan and Lamèque have brought to
these parishes an industrial developmen-t of
a high order which, in turn, has completely
changed the economic outlook of this part of
Gloucester.
The prosperity and happiness of a country
usually go hand in hand with the intellectual
development and educational standard of its
citizens. In this connection our Canadian colleges and universities have played a most
important part in the development of Canada
and the establishment of the unparalleled
prosperity which we now enjoy. The importance of our universities, from a national point
of view, was clearly demonstrated by their
representatives in each one of the provinces
visited by the Massey Commission.- The deans
of these universities also underlined the growing financial difficulties with which they are
faced. Since the end of the war and in all the
provinces, the student body has been much
greater than the universities were equipped
or could afford to handle. I know, we all know
of dozens of young men who are prevented
from even starting their technical or professional training because of the overcrowding
of our schools of higher learning.
With the ever-increasing cost of education,
private donations, public subscriptions and
provincial grants are no longer adequate to
meet aninual expenses.
In order to maintain the intellectual
development of Canadian citizens at a high
standard, it becomes increasingly evident that
the federal government will eventually have
to play its part and lend assistance to our
universities, along the lines adopted to remedy
the shortage of hospital beds as a means of
ensuring national health. In the national
economy, intellectual health is as necessary
as physical health. If we want doctors, dentists, nurses, engineers and technicians, if
we want to further scientific research, our
universities will have to have more funds.

There is a way to provide for these needs
without encroaching upon the sacred rights
of provincial autonomy.
It is to be hoped that the Massey Commission will make recommendations which
take the needs of our universities into account.
We have mentioned intellectual health. As a
doctor, I would be remiss in my professional
duty if I failed to mention the government's
plans for improving the physical health of
the Canadian people.
For more than a third of a century, the
different political parties have advocated
national health programs or health insurance. But it took the last war and the appalling revelations of the defects and weaknesses
uncovered by the medical examination of our
recruits to show the urgent need of setting up
immediately a far-reaching and national plan
for the preservation and improvement of the
health of our people.
During the war, all the living strength of
the nation was bent upon the defeat of the
enemy. Within the limits of their means and
in their usual manner, the provinces continued to care for public health which for that
matter was their sole responsibility. But it
became more and more apparent that it would
be necessary, and without further delay, to
set in motion a wider plan, providing better
co-operation and financial resources of a
national order to meet the health deficiencies
which had astonished us at the beginning of
the war.
That is why, as early as 1943, the speech
from the throne indicated the government's
intention to launch a far-reaching health
insurance program meant to co-ordinate
federal and provincial services and to include
the establishment of a health insurance plan.
Unfortunately, it was impossible to obtain
the federal-provincial co-ordination upon
which the success of a national plan depended
because, at the federal-provincial conference
of 1945, it was not possible to reach an agreement with certain provinces, so that the plans
set forth in 1943 were left in abeyance.
Finally, in 1948, the Dominion Government,
conscious of the ever-growing need for implementing certain health measures with more
vigour and energy amended the original proposals placed before the provinces in 1945
and voted the necessary appropriations in
order to carry out the new health programme
outlined by the Prime Minister on May 14,
1948.

FEBRUARY 21, 1950
The grants voted on that occasion were
to be made available for the following
purposes:
1. General public health services.
2. Tuberculosis control.
3. Mental health care.
4. Venereal disease control.
5. Grants to crippled children.
6. Professional training in public health
matters.
7. Public health research.
8. Cancer control.
9. Grants for the construction of hospitals.
You are ail aware of the public health
programme which has been launched in
this country; however, the public at large
s0 frequently enquires what the Government
is doing in order to improve the health of
the Canadian people that I seize this opportunity to remind themn of the benefits which
they enjoy without realîzing it.
Grants to provinces for health purposes
exceed 31 million dollars per year. Already,
although two years have noît yet elapsed
since the programme has been put into
practice, progress is apparent.
The fight
against tuberculosis and venereai diseases, in
particular, show gratifying resuits.
I 1948, there was a shortage of 60,000
hospital beds. By the end of 1949 the accômmodation had been increased by 20,000
additional beds and it is hoped that the
shortage wiil have been remed'ied by the end
of 1951.
Canada spends per *capita at present much
more than the United States for practically
ail our health services. For instance, our
grants for the construction of hospitals are
twice as large; for tuberculosis control, five
times as large, for the control of cancer,
fourteen times as large and for the care of
mental diseases, sîxteen times as large.
Ail the nations of the world have acclai*med
our comprehensive health programme. The
entry of the federal government in the field
of public health, so soon after the adoption
of its various social legislations such as family
allowances, pensions for the aged and the
blind, unemployment insurance, and allowances for veterans' rehabilitation, is the
latest step taken by our government in order
ta, ensure to each citizen the best opportunities
for developing his personal skills and enjoy
social security. The Minister of Health and
Welfare, Honourable Paul Martin, was quite
55950-3

justified when hie said: "Owing to this close
co-operation between the Dominion and the
provincial authorities in ail matters of public
health and thanks also to these additional
financial means which wili enable us to
control diseases on a united front, we may,
in ail confidence, expect to accomplish continued progress in ail our health services.
The primitive health methods followed by
Canada in the past wiil now be replaced
by an enlightened public health programme
in order that we may reach our ultimate goal:
radiant health for ail our Canadian citizens."
(Text):
Honourable senators, ît is not my intention
to repeat in English the remarks which I have
made in the language of my Acadian ancestors. I do, however, wish to extend to the
mover of the address (Hon. Mr. Golding) my
sincere congratulations on the excellent way
in which he acquitted himself of hîs task.
Somne Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Mon. Mr. Veniot: I admire the ease and
grace with which the honou-rable senator, who
is no newcomer to parliamentary circles,
discusses questions of state of such great
importance as those which hie covered today.
I should like now to devote some remarks
to a question which is of great importance to
ail Canadian citizens who dwell along the
Atlantic coast, namely, the fishing industry.
During the pres-ent session arnendsnents wiil
be proposed ta the Fisheries Prices Support
Act ta 1provide continuing support ta the
,primary industry of the fisheries. There will
also be an increase in the estimates of the
Department of Fisheries, ta take care of the
proposed expansion of the department's activities. When the estimates for the Department
of Fisheries were up before the other house
in December last, the Honourable Mr. Mayhew, the Minister, made a statement concerning future developments of his department which elicited congratulations and
praise from, members of al parties in that
house. In nmy estimation it was the most comprehiensive, the most far-reaching and the
most encouragin-g pronouncement ever made
by a Minister of Fisheries. I wish ta associate
myself with. the many thousands of Canadians
who rejoice at the news that such important
forward steps are to be taken by the department ta expand its activities, and 1 extend
to the minister my heartiest congratulations.
Several parts of the minister's statement
seem ta, dovetail perfectly with thoughts

SENATE
which I expressed in 1937, when I was a
member of the other house. At that time I
pointed out several major factors which were
responsible for the depression of the fishing
industry in many sections of the Maritimes.
Chief among these factors were the antiquated
methods of catching and processing fish and
the lack of proper and adequate equipment. I
established a comparison between the constant
progress of agriculture in its several branches
and the stagnation of the fisheries, and
pointed out the difference between the assistance and leadership given to the farmer by
government bodies and the utter neglect and
misery in which fishermen were allowed to
wallow. While millions were spent each year
by governments for the adývancement, development, and rehabilitation of agriculture, and
for the education and the protection of
farmers and farmers' sons, fishermen continued to be the outcasts, the "poor geezers"
who risked their lives on the high seas, at the
mercy of winds, storms and wrecks.
Fishermen of the Maritimes justly claimed
that something more radical than the mere
making of regulations with regard to fishing
seasons should be done for the restoration and
rehabilitation of the fisheries. As primary
food producers, they considered themselves
entitled to the same kind of assistance and
guidance, educationally and otherwise, as was
provided for the farmer. Their contention
was that the 1937 set-up of the Department
of Fisheries was not in tune with the trend
of the times; that the department was not
abreast of the changes which the fishing
industry in other countries had undergone.
Martime members of the day called for a
complete revamping of the Department of
Fisheries, so as to give it a set-up comparable to that of agriculture. From a "standpat" department of regulation, patrol and
conservation, which it had been since confederation, there was urgent need for its
transformation into an active, wide-awake
department of leadership and education, of
initiative, expansion and development in its
relation to the several fields of the industry,
namely:
1. Production and catch of fish.
2. Collection and storage.
3. Preparing and processing.
4. Distribution and marketing.
These four points were considered in detail,
emphasis being laid upon the need for the
more modern methods employed all along
the line in other coumtries. I pointed out the
urgency-if we were to win the American
and the home markets-of breaking away
from the traditional products of dry salted
fish and pickled cod.

This appeal for leadership, for constructive action and development of the industry,
was made in the interest of 20,000 Canadians
from the Maritimes-fishermen and their
families-and as many more from other sections of Canada, whose bread and butter and
very existence depended entirely on such
leadership as they themselves could not
develop because of their lack of training and
abject poverty. They did not want charity;
they only asked for light and guidance in
their own field of endeavour, such as other
countries gave to their fishermen to help them
develop their natural talents and their inherited tendencies to live off the sea.
Those of us who lived in the lean years
when the Department of Fisheries was influenced by but one man, and when successive ministers could not make a single move
without the o.k. of that official, will recall
the insuperable objections raised against the
slightest suggestion of change in the operation of the department or in the general picture of the fisheries industry. Year after
year members from the Maritimes continued
to press the claims of the fishermen, but it
was not until changes were brought about in
the personnel of the department that the
government was able to initiate some measure
of progress in the department and in the
industry. This had to be done piecemeal, a
slice at a time, following more or less the
method of trial and error, until new personnel could be developed and trained to take
care of the innovations.
Beginning in 1938, subsidies were granted
for the construction of cold storage plants
and frozen bait plants and depots; for several
years free bait was distributed in the more
distressed areas; with the assistance of federal and provincial grants, a large freezing
and processing plant of 150,000 pounds daily
capacity was established at Caraquet, in
Gloucester county. Each year substantial
sums have been voted for co-operative education among the fishermen. Instructors were
sent out now and then to show fishermen the
latest methods of curing and processing fish,
and the preparation of boneless cod, and
during winter months short courses were
occasionally given in fish processing and canning; immediately after the war the Fisheries
Prices Support Act was passed; federalprovincial fisheries conferences have been
held at regular intervals to study the problems
of the industry, and substantial sums have
been set aside by provincial and federal departments to establish a loan fund for the

FEBRUARY 21, 1950
construction of boats of the dragger type.
Twenty-two such vessels now operate from
Gloucester county with marked success. The
Fishery Research Board has been enlarged. In
each of the Maritime Provinces a department
or section of a department of fisheries has
been set up to co-operate with the federal
department in assisting the fishermen.
Now this is, perhaps, an incomplete list of
the steps taken in recent years for the betterment of the fishery. I think it has been very
fortunate for the industry that the same political party continued in office over a goodly
period of years, thus giving officials in charge
an opportunity to gradually develop and
maintain a continuity of policy and action
which could not have obtained if governments
of different political colour had followed each
other in office, with varying policies concerning the fisheries, and with, perhaps, entirely
different views concerning the importance of
this primary food-producing industry.'
As a consequence of what has taken place,
the picture of the fishery today has substantially improved over what it was thirteen
years ago. However, much yet remains to
be done to bring it to the level which exists
in other fish-producing countries; and it is
the filling in of this gap and the co-ordination
of al the department's activities which, no
doubt the minister had in mind when he
outlined the recently-developed policy of his
department.
In bringing my remarks to a close, I should
like to give honourable senators a summary
of the minister's statement. As a preface
to it he appropriately announced that during
the eighteen months he had been in office he,
accompanied by some of his departmental
staff, had visited every province in Canada
to discuss fisheries, prospects, and betterment, with provincial government officials,
with fishermen themselves, with processors,
wholesalers, cold storage and warehouse
interests. These visits were for the definite
purpose of gathering first-hand information
for a composite picture of the whole industry
to be presented to the government and to
parliament. In his statement he reviewed
the situation thoroughly, put his finger on all
the weak points, and outlined what he
termed "the framework for fishery development", which is aimed at removing al hindrances to expansion.
Briefly, his program is divided into two
parts: phase one, expansion of North American and overseas markets; phase two, development of backward areas of the industry.
The first part of the program aims at producing quality as the essential factor in
expansion of markets. To that end there
55950-3&

will be three services, as follows: First, the
fish inspection service will be enlarged; it
will extend from sea to table-in boats, in
plants, in freezers, in the selling trade, in
kitchens of hotels, restaurants and homes;
second, technical services will provide fishermen, small plants, and the wholesale and
retail distributors of fish with technical hel
for the improvement of their individual
operations; third, a consumer service branch
will supply education to the consumer by
giving demonstrations and lectures on fish
cooking to women's groups and schools, thus
encouraging more Canadians to eat more
fish. The consumer will be shown how to
buy fish, what to buy, how to cook, and
how to serve fish.
Phase 2 announces steps to help the east
coast fishing industry to modernize catching
operations at lower costs by issuing trawler
licences more frequently and increasing the
number of dragger boats, so as to multiply
the catch and help fishermen meet the growing market demands for fresh and frozen
fish.
The Minister gave new hope to the fishermen in the following words:
In the backward areas, there is special need for
the establishment of technical and demonstration
services to fishermen and small plants, particularly
in Newfoundland and the Maritimes. These services
are as necessary to the fisheries as experimental
farms and demonstration stations are to agriculture.
We plan accordingly to use the new technical services division to demonstrate to each of the main
fishing areas the best, that is known on fishing and
flsh-handling methods. We propose also to develop
an intelligence service to fishermen, one of the
most important functions of which will be to advise
on the whereabouts of fish schools during various
seasons.

This is the first time in the history of
fisheries in Canada that a minister of this
department has stood up in his place in
parliament and made a definite, all-embracing
statement on policy concerning the much
needed development of fisheries through the
department. I consider it a red-letter day
in the history of Canadian fisheries.
Those of us who come from Newfoundland
and the Maritimes, where most of the undeveloped areas exist, will realize what such
a program means to the fishery. I feel confident that the leadership given by the
minister will go far towards assuring to his
department and to the fishing industry the
position of importance which belongs to
them in the economy of Canada.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding
for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. John T. Haig: In rising to take part
in the debate on the Speech from the Throne,
I first want to pay my respects to the mover
of the motion (Hon. Mr. Golding). I was
delighted to hear his excellent speech yesterday afternoon. It sounded so pleasant to me
that I looked around two or three times to
see whether it was one of my own friends
talking. I kept wondering about this, and
finally I got our Whip to count our members,
and I learned from him that the gentleman
speaking did not belong to our group. He
is a government supporter, but I want to
congratulate him on his excellent address.
I regret that I could not understand the
first part of the speech of the second'er of
the motion (Hon. Mr. Veniot), but I gathered
that there is a fishing problem in the Maritime Provinces. If my honourable friend
wishes any assistance with respect to that
problem, he is certainly free to call upon
the members from Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta, who will tell him ail about the
technique of growing and marketing wheat.
I should like at this time to say a word
of welcome to the new member from NewWithin the
found-land (Hon. Mr. Burke).
last month a very distinguished member of
the government, the Secretary of State (Hon.

Mr. Bradley), wbo comes from Newfoundland, visited my city. Both he and his wife
had a pleasant time, and I know that the
citizens of Winnipeg enjoyed their visit very
much. Later a certain gentleman said to
me, "Do you know, Senator Haig, these
people from Newfoundland are very nearly
civilized". I said, "Well, the ones I have met
are civilized, but I do not know about the
rest of them. There is a new man from there
in the Senate this year; I have not met him
yet; he may be civilized, but I am not sure"
Seriously, I do want to say to honourabli
senators from Newfoundland that the Secretary of State made a fine impression or
the people of the city of Winnipeg, and ir
that respect his good wife was not second
best.
Now, coming to the Speech from the
Throne, I honestly think it can be described
in three words, "bits and pieces". After a
careful reading of the Speech I was unable
to find in it any new program to meet the
pressing problems of the day. Such matters
as amendment of the constitution, the United
Nations, the conference in Ceylon, the cold
war and such kindred subjects are discussed,
and no doubt these are important in themselves, but there is no suggestion as to any
cure for the difficulties arising therefrom.
I will not go into a discussion of the constituticn. There was a conference between
the federal government and the provinces,
and so far as it went I am glad of the progress
that was made. But I am not one of those
who becomes extremely optimistic ail at once.
That conference was only a sort of cocktail
party preceding the real discussion of the constitution. Cocktail parties are, for some of us,
very pleasant affairs, as this conference was,
but the real problems will arise at the subsequent conference when the categories are
dealt with. I will only say at this time that
as a Canadian I hope that conference will
reach a conclusion satisfactory to ail the
provinces. I say "ail the provinces" advisedly,
because the united Canada which we ail
desire can be achieved only if every part
of the country feels that it bas got a fair deal
from ahl other parts.
I hope that the premiers and their colleagues
and assistants from the various provinces will
come to that meeting with the idea that they
are going to get a fair deal; and that they will
get one. We do not want any constitutional
arrangement that will breed trouble in the
years to come. I do not believe the public
men of this generation are so much abler than
the men who drafted the British North
America Act of 1867 that members of this
bouse will not rise in their places fifty or
eighty years from now-for I think the
Senate will still be in existence then-and

FEBRUARY 22, 1950
complain that constitutional changes made in
1950 did not work out as they were expected
to do. But I am sure that if the delegates
to the conference enter upon its work with
the same spirit of good will and co-operation
as prevailed among the Fathers of Confederation, the work done now will be as good as
what was done then. That is all I can hope
for.
The problems facing Canada today have to
do with trade, unemployment, communistic
influence and increasing expenditures with
decreasing income. I will deal first with communism and the cold war.
I live in a city that has a very large communistic vote. Indeed, I doubt if in any
other city in Canada a larger proportion of
the population votes continuously for communistic candidates in municipal, provincial
and dominion elections. On the Winnipeg
school board we have one communist out of
fifteen members; in the city council we have
two out of eighteen; in the legislature we
have one out of twelve. In each case the
proportion is quite large. And what is the
motive of these communistic representatives?
Well, take the school board for instance.
The communist member on the school board
constantly advocates maximum expenditures.
Possibly he believes in the soundness of what
he advocates, but I really doubt that he does.
I think he hopes that extravagant expenditure
will break down the educational set-up in our
city. The same is true of the communists
in the city council. The constant agitation
for increased civic expenditures is an attempt
to break down the municipal government.
There is similar agitation in the legislature
of the province of Manitoba, but to a lesser
extent, because the population of the city of
Winnipeg is only about one-quarter of the
population of the province. Our people must
understand that the purpose of spreading the
doctrines of communism in our country is to
wreck our economic system. If we examine
the propaganda technique employed in all
the European countries which have fallen
under communistic influence, we will see that
its purpose was to break down the municipal,
provincial and state governments, and then
to overthrow tliem.
I was delighted to hear the honourable
senator from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding) say that we who do not believe in communism fail to preach enough against the
present tendency of many people, when they
are in trouble, to go to the government. We
have failed to tell the people of this country
that money does not grow on berry bushes,
and that the money expended by the government-and I am not criticizing the present
government particularly-is money taken
from you and me, and everyone in Canada,

by way of taxation. I think the honourable
m'over of the Address took the proper stand
when he said that we have to recognize that
many of our people take this attitude, and
find some way of remedying the situation.
If we in our calm judgment decide that
such social services as old age pensions,
unemployment insurance and war veterans'
pensions should be continued, I have no
objection.
I do, however, object to the
propaganda that is being spread across this
country, by many people, that all deficiencies
should be made up by the government. I may
be treading on dangerous ground, but I say
that by means of this kind of propaganda the
communists are trying to break down our
system of government.
We in this country believe-some more
than others, perhaps-in the Christian
religion. The communists are atheists. What
makes their propaganda powerful is the fact
that in our country certain people who do not
deserve it get something for nothing; and we
are going to have trouble with that element
as long as this propaganda goes unchallenged.
I do not think that we will see a war within
a year or two, but unless we stop the spread
of the communistic doctrine in our country
war is inevitable.
It is shocking to note that at the last
municipal election in the city of Toronto-I
am not familiar with Montreal-30,000 votes
were recorded for the communist party. I
know that in my home city of Winnipeg there
were nearly 8,000 communist votes cast. AÊ
I say, it is shocking to think that in this country, with its acme of freedom through the
democratic system, so many people should
vote in sympathy with a country which does
not understand' or .practise democracy. When a
communist is cornered on the subject, he will
admit, if he is honest, that Russia has the
worst form of dictatorship, because it has a
system that is democratic in appearance. At
election time one name appears on the ballot
and a citizen may either vote for the candidate or put in a blank ballot, which is the
same as voting for the candidate. That, to
me, is not democracy at all.
I am perturbed about the spread of communism in Canada and in the United States,
not because it can make real progress and
upset and overthrow the governments, but
because in our attack against it something is
lacking, and we fail to meet the propaganda
that is circulated. Some may tell you that
communism will be overcome if people are
given lots to eat and plenty to wear. But that
will not meet thé Communist tactics. Fundamentally, they preach that there is nothing
that a government cannot do if it wants to
do it, and that they will do what is wanted if
they get the power.

SENATE
Our people spent last year on military preparations $384 million, and probably $400
million will be voted this year. Within ten
years a great part of the equipment purchased will be obsolete, and much of our
present-day training will be valueless. I am
not without knowledge of this matter. Take
a young man of twenty and train him two
years for air service: when his course is over,
and he is twenty-two years old, his further
term of usefulness will not be more than
four or five years. A young man I know had
a brother, a very distinguished airman, twelve
years younger than himself. When the war
outlook seemed desperate, in 1943, he wrote
to his brother and told him he thought he
would join the Air Force. The airman wrote
back: "Dear brother, don't do it; you would
just be another arm-chair soldier, and no
good at all to anybody; in fact you would be
dangerous to everybody with whom you
came in contact;"-and this, for reasons which
are clear enough to those who understand
what air training involves. If a plane engine
is hit by an anti-aircraft gun and set on fire,
the pilot has one minute to put the fire out,
or the engine will explode, and "good-night",
the crew are in ternity. So it can easily be
understood that in ten years, or even less,
an enormous part of our current military
expenditures will be useless. I do not object
to this money being spent, because, like almost
everybody else, I realize that under present
conditions we must be ready, if war breaks
out, to take our place at a moment's notice
in the struggle against aggressive nations. So
much for communism.
The next question with which I want to
deal is unemployment and what it involves.
The generation represented by those sitting in
this chamber has a much better understanding of this problem than any which preceded
it. Until 1930 we in Canada did not know
what unemployment meant. True, a certain
amount occurred in the winter, and sometimes there was suffering in the summer, but
mass unemployment, here and elsewhere, was
unknown. Now we have resolved-and I do
not think this resolution is confined to any
one party-that never again shall men and
women suffer as they did in the thirties for
lack of food, clothing and shelter. I do not
know how serious our unemployment situation is. The government have indicated, I
believe, that it is now mainly seasonal. I
doubt this. While some part of it is due to
seasonal fluctuations, there is a slow decline
in sales of goods of every kind, both primary
products and manufactured articles. To meet
this trend, employers are letting out this man
and that man, and the numbers of unemployed constanlly increase.

I know that the subject presents many
difficulties, but it is my hope that whatever
the government undertake in this regard will
be done in pursuance of a long-term policy.
One factor in the problem is that in many
industries wages have risen to very high
levels. I am not discussing whether this
state of things is justified; I am merely pointing to the fact. Although, for instance, the
railway companies recently were granted a
rate increase of 21 per cent, practically the
entire revenue so obtained has been absorbed
in increased wage rates; and a new application is now under consideration. I repeat, I
am not arguing that the men are not entitled
to what they get, although I have my own
opinion about it; but if further wage
increases are granted, the railways will be
compelled to apply for another increase of
rates; and so the cycle will be repeated.
Now, when we run into a depression, it is
the higher-paid and the senior men, for the
most part, who stay with their jobs, while
the lower-paid and part-time employees drop
out. Taken as a whole, our economy is very
difficult to keep in balance. I know that in
discussing it I am on dangerous ground. But,
to speak candidly, I believe we must realize
that it cannot be carried on unless the
primary producers get a reasonable return
for their products, and I include those of the
fisheries, the forest, the mines and the farms.
To my mind this is fundamental so far as
Canada is concerned; some other countries
may be in a different position. Some of our
friends may say that I have disregarded other
important elements in our economy, but that
is not so: I am trying to be realistic. Canada's
prosperity at present, and probably for some
years to come, depends very largely on the
return we receive in the world's markets for
our primary products. Even some manufactured goods brought here for the purpose of
manufacture and sale in their finished form
abroad may be regarded from the viewpoint
of primary products. However I believe that
the returns received by our fishermen, lumbermen, farmers and other primary producers
have never been exorbitant in relation to a
proper standard of living. It may be that in
the past three or four years, owing to world
conditions, our primary products have
secured rather higher prices than usual in
the markets of the world, with the result
that the producers have been able to buy a
little more and pay off some of their mortgages. But by and large they have never had
too big an income; and they are now facing
the possibility of a decline.
On 'his fundamental issue Canada must
take a definite stand. I believe that we, as

FEBRUARY 22, 1950
men and women who have had some experience in the world, ought to lay down as a
cardinal principle that the primary producer,
who provides the basis of our prosperity,
should have an adequate return for his
labour. The situation is hardly the same in
the United States and Great Britain, but as
so large a part of our own requirements can
be satisfied only by bringing in products from
abroad and manufacturing them here, our
bulk products such as wheat, timber, pulpwood, fish, minerals and so on, have to be
sold on the world market, and the money
received from their sale used to purchase the
other goods we require to maintain our standard of living. I hope that when considering
this question of unemployment we will see to
it that our standard of living is based on the
requirements of the primary producers, and
not on the demands of some great union
organization or group of lawyers, doctors or
plumbers. It should be what we, as reasonable men and women, believe employees
should receive in relation to what is received
by primary producers for their products.
The next point with which I should like
to deal is a little aside from the usual
subjects.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Is it on housing?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. I may say about
housing, however, that rent control is being
removed so fast that even I cannot keep up
with it. In fact, the increase of 18 per cent
for unheated property, and 22 per cent for
heated property, caused rents to go so high
that even I did not have the gall to take full
advantage of the increases.
What I want to discuss now, honourable
senators, is the serious problem of the cost of
education in Canada today. For example, this
year the estimate for education in the public
schools and collegiates of Winnipeg is approximately $6 million. Of this amount the province contributes only about $330,000. Our
property owners pay the rest, and they cannot
carry this load any longer. I do not care where
you come from, you will find the same problem ail across Canada. For instance, a fiftystudent classroom in Winnipeg costs on the
average about $10,000. I admit that because
of our mild climate we do not have to build
expensively.

contributing $300 on a salary of $1,500, which
is only one-fifth. This situation has been
discussed with tne provincial authorities, and
they say they cannot pay any more. I do
not know where the money will come from;
but education is more necessary in this country today than ever before.
A new department of Immigration and
Citizenship has been formed, and if we are
going to make our country greater by bringing people here, we will want them to understand our ways and become part of us. The
best way of doing this is through a good
system of education. I am sure the teachers
of other provinces are just as competent as
our teachers in Manitoba, so I can say without fear of contradiction that we have as fine
a body of men and women in the teaching profession in our schools, colleges and universities, as are to be found anywhere in the
world. They are loyal and energetic, and
are anxious to give our children a fine education and make them good citizens. There can
be no hope of any curtailment of their
salaries; if anything, we shall have to increase
them. Whether this is to be done out of
federal funds or out of a special account, I do
not say; but something has to be done. I
have heard it said that the province of Quebec
would object to the federal government
having anything to do with education in that
province. I simply do not believe it; and I
do not believe that Manitoba or Ontario or
any other province would object. I think my
honourable friend from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) will agree with me that for the
past fifty years our province has enjoyed a
reasonably economical, administration; yet
today we find ourselves faced with a cost of
education that is staggering. Our property
owners are the ones who have to pay, and
they will not be able to carry the load much
longer.
I come now to Canada's real problem,
world trade. I could discuss the wheat agreement or the restrictions that have been imposed
on the sale of cattle and goods to the United
States during the past four or five years. I
could discuss the devaluation of the Canadian currency-and I think I shall say a word
or two about this. For many years in this
house I have preached that it would be better
for us to have a limited amount of devaluation. Then the honourable member from
Toronto-Trinity

And without being zbastful, let me remind
honourable members that about a year ago on
a similar occasion I suggested to this house
that the goverrnment would hold the election
on the 27th of June. Not a single person in
this chamber-except myself-thought I was
right, and the press paid so littie attention
to my forecast that they indicated they had
no confidence in it. But it came true. Why
did I make that forecast? Because trade
returns from ail parts of the world, as reported
in our press and in trade journals, indicated
to me at least-and I think to some othersthat the boom was running out, and I was
persuaded that the government itself knew
this and wanted the election over before the
ordinary person realized the intensity of the
trade depression that was coming on.
As I said before, one camouflage after
another has been used to luli the people.
What did the goverrament do last spring? It
distributed a very large surplus of the whegt
money on hand; it made a cut in income tax,
especially in the lower brackets; and it
refunded compulsory savings made by the
people. AJI this made the people feel that
there was great prosperity in Canada, and
the result of the election showed clearly that
what had been done had that effect on the
voters. As somneone said-I think it was
someone in the United States-"People neyer
shoot Santa Claus." I have no interest at al
inthe resuit of the election, nor do I suppose
any other member of this house has, and
1 refer to it only to, illustrate what the government has been doing. But it does not matter
what has been done. The laws of economica
cannot be resisted long, and the tide is beginning to turn.
Someone may ask me what is the use of,
saying ail these things? I think it is of great
use to warn the people of Canada to prepar>
for the situation that is approaching. The
suggestion that some governiment intervention
can avert the trade depression that is
approaching or is now actually upon us is al
nonsense. The people of Canada have got
to realize that the honeymoon following the
war is now over, and that we have to, work

55950-4

harder, be more diligent, and accept a lower
standard of living, if we are to ride out the
storm. We do not want a repetition of the
30's, in which no action was taken until the
storm was upon us, and it was too late. I urge
the government to get its house in order and
to tell us, as did the honourable senator from
Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding) yesterday,
that it ýcan. only spend what it takes out of the
people in taxes, and if the tax-paying capacity is falling there will be less taxes to take.
In closing, I wish to repeat that Canada is
a great country, with tremendous resources
of field, forest, ocean and farm, but hard and
diligent work is required to make a living
under present conditions. There is no easy
road for us. May we ail be prepared to do
our share in trying to avoid another crisis
such as this country had in the 30's. Let us
be determined that the men and women of
this country shall have work and wages, and
the chance to make a living for themselves
and their families. And that wrnl only be
possible when we ail realize the probiems
which, as I have tried to, point out, are facing this country.
Honourable senators, that is my philosophy.
1 arn not criticizing the governiment. Whatever
has been done is done-it is water under the
bridge. But I arn saying that we senatorsmen and women who have a secure position
in 11fe, and who are trying to, render faithful
service to, our country-should realize that
we are calied upon to make a great effort.
As we i this house struggled from 1939 to
1945 to help defend democracy and the cause
of freedorn, so today we have a grim struggle
to, keep our men and wornen fromn feeling
the pinch o! poverty and to give to'them an
ýopportunity to work and earn wages that wil
provide for thern a proper standard o! living.
I>do not know why I arn a member of this
chamber, but I presume that those who
appointed me thought I could make at least
Borne contribution to the weif are of Canada.
Et behooves ail of us to be familiar with the
problerns of our country, such as the falling
off of trade and the lowering of personal
incomes, and, avoiding criticism, to do our
best to assist in making Canada a country
worthy of the Canadian people.

COMMITTEE OF SELECTION
CONCURRENCE IN REPORT
Hon. W. A. Buchanan presented the report

of the Committee of Selection.
(See appendix at end of today's report.)
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the question as to consideration is
put to the house, may I say a word of
explanation? It may be recalled that a year
ago when the report of the Committee of
Selection was presented and a motion was
made for its adoption, the objection was
raised, and properly, that the report should
not be adopted before it had been printed in
our proceedings. I agreed with the objection
and gave the undertaking that so long as I
had any responsibility in the house I would
not ask that a report of this kind be adopted
on the same day as presented. I call attention to that now for a special reason. As I
think honourable members know, it is
expected that, with the co-operation of the
various parties in another place, a bill to
amend the Unemployment Insurance Act will
be passed there this week, and it is desired to
have it passed here also in time to receive
Royal Assent not later than the 28th of the
month, in order that the measure may become
operative on the lst of March.
If I were to follow the procedure which a
year or two ago I undertook to follow, the
report of the Committee of Selection would
be laid on the Table today and would appear
in our printed proceedings tomorrow, when,
perhaps, it would be adopted. After that
there would have to be organization meetings
before the various committees could function.
It had been my intention to move that when
the house adjourns today it stand adjourned
until Monday evening; but if we are to have
a committee available to deal with the Unemployment Insurance Bill on Tuesday morning,
I have no alternative but to ask either that
the report of the Committee of Selection be
considered as it is, or else that we meet here
tomorrow in order to adopt it. I do not see
any other way of handling the matter. I am
in the hands of the Senate as to what should
be done.
This is the first report of the Committee of
Selection for the present session, and it comprises nominations for every committee

except the Committee on Divorce. As to
other committees, in most cases the Committee of Selection acquiesced in suggestions
made by individual senators. Vacancies have
been left in the membership of certain committees, and if after the report has been
printed, any honourable senator would like
to be appointed to a committee to which he
has not been nominated, I shall be happy
to take the matter into consideration and, if
there is a vacancy, make the appropriate
motion for his appointment.
In these circumstances I would ask the
house, despite the representations I made a
year or so ago, to accept the present report
without going through the tedious performance of having all the names read. If that
suggestion is not agreeable to honourable
members, I see no alternative to meeting
tomorrow, in order that a committee may be
available for consideration of the Unemployment Insurance Bill on Tuesday. Unless
objection is raised, I will suggest that the
house give the report immediate consideration.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the report be consid.ered?
Some Hon. Senators: Now.

I move that the committee's report be concurred in.

Hon. Ray Petten: I should like to ask the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) if
his reference yesterday to Newfoundland is
correctly reported in Hansard. Certainly the
report does not convey the impression which
I gathered from his speech when I heard it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have not read it.
Hon. Mr. Petten: It looks very different in
cold print.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Read the reference.
Hon. Mr. Petten: I find on page 16, at the
bottom of the first column:
I should like at this time to say a word of welcome to the new member from Newfoundland.
Within the last month a very distinguished member
of the government, the Secretary of State, who

he and his wife had a pleasant time, and I know
that the citizens of Winnipeg enjoyed their visit
very much. Later a certain gentleman said to me,
"Do you know, Senator Haig, these people from
Newfoundland are very nearly civilized."

That is not what I gathered from the
senator's speech yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Is there any way whereby
this passage can be deleted from Hansard?
Hon. Mr. Haig: 'The passage cannot be
deleted, but it can be changed. The word
"nearly" can be made to read "highly".
Hon. Mr. Petten: Thank you.
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I am not going to criticize the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) for what he said in his speech
yesterday, but I do feel that he made one
grievous omission. I listened with rapt attention to the excellent and kindly tribute he
paid to the mover (Hon. Mr. Golding) and
seconder (Hon. Mr. Veniot) of the Address.
Needless to say, I heartily agreed with every
word he said about them. I am sure, however, that all honourable senators will realize
-as should the leader of the opposition, with
his long parliamentary experience-that the
responsibility of choosing the mover and
seconder of the Address falls upon the leader
of the government; and I do believe that upon
some suitable occasion my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Haig) should refer to the good
judgment which I exercised in having chosen
these speakers.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Though I am disappointed by this omission, I certainly do not
wish to detract in any way from the references
he made to the speeches of the mover and
seconder. Indeed, judging from the favourable comments I have heard from other senators, I am sure my honourable friend
expressed the unanimous opinion of all who
had the pleasure of hearing these gentlemen.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The speech of the
mover (Hon. Mr. Golding), was couched in
excellent language, and his sentiments were
well presented. I envied him his olequence
and his ability to express himself with a minimum of accurately placed words. Like my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
I was unable to follow everything said in'
French by the seconder of the Address (Hon.

SENATE
western countries are already moving in this
direction to a greater or lesser degree. I suppose the practical approach would be to move
gradually and not too quickly.
Canada has already gone a long way in this
direction, and in due course will go further.
As honourable senators are aware, a joint
committee of both houses of parliament is
now being formed to consider the question
of old age pensions with the view of devising
a better means test. The question of old age
pensions is a broad and important one, and
provision for old age is becoming more and
more a feature of our life. Everywhere
around us public services are incorporating
into their structures some scheme of retirement allowances. The question, I should
think, is how to make desirable benefits
available to almost everyone without upsetting our economic structure. I suppose the
only people who are not concerned with a
matter of this kind are those who have no
intention of growing old. The matter is probably becoming more and more important as
high income taxes and low interest rates on
money require the setting aside of an increasingly large sum in order to provide even a
modest retiring allowance. For my part I
not only like the idea in the abstract that
there should be some provision for old age,
but I had no difficulty in reconciling myself
to it when I was appointed to the Senate.
While on this subject I wish to make a
suggestion, which can properly come from
me, since I would not benefit if it were
adopted. When in future this government
or another government is considering some
form of contributory old age pensions, care

Mr. Veniot), although I could follow it better
than I have been able to do in the past.
Honourable senators already know that our
honourable friend from Gloucester (Hon.
Mr. Veniot) is a distinguished son of a distinguished father, and we cannot but realize
from his speech that he possesses a wide
experience and an intimate knowledge of one
of the major industries in which he and his
people are so greatly concerned.
I should like to take this opportunity to
compliment the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) on his excellent address.
We hold different views on certain matters,
but in the main I feel that his speech was
further evidence of his wide knowledge of
public affairs.
I am heartily in agreement with his remarks
about communism and the danger of the
spread of its influence. But I am not so sure
that I agree with his suggestion that the living
standards of people have little to do with the
spread of communisn, and that one of the
best methods of combating it is by way of
propaganda and certain organized efforts.
The history of the post-war years shows that
with the improvement of economic conditions
in Western Europe, the apparent onward
sweep of communism was checked and was
turned in the direction of those great areas
in the East where living standards are deplorab'y low. I am convinced that would-be
dictators, whether they be communistic or
Nazi in their outlook, will not find in countries
which enjoy freedom from hunger and want
any fertile soil in which to sow the seed of
their doctrine.

FEBRUARY 23, 1950
We ail can recail instances of members o! the
House o! Commons who sacrified their own
business interests to devote their time and
attention to public affairs, and who were not
f ortunate enough to secure a position entitling
them to some provision for their old age.
When the turn of the wheel came for them,
either through political defeat or voluntary
retirement after long service, their financial
position was so desperate that their friends
had to come to their assistance. It is true
that in many such cases, in recognition of the
sterling quality of service rendered to the
country friends have been glad to assist; but
can anyone give me a logical reason why
public servants of this character should not
be eligible for participation in a general
system of contributory old age pensions?
I realize that the matter would have to be
deait with on a realistic basis, and that any
worthwhile participation would probably
have to depend upon long service. At any
rate, I think there should be some provision
whereby persons who have served the
country long and faîthfully as members o!
the House of Commons should be able to look
forward to a reasonable measure o! security
for tbemselves and those dependent upon
them.
I do not think any exception can be taken
by my honourable friend's remarks on the
desirability of in.creased educational facilities.
Inevitably this subi ect revolves around the
question of cost, and that brings it home ta
governments, for education, at least prirnary
education, is in general the responsibility of
governiments. A point that always presents
much difficulty is whether the home owner
as such should be taxed more or less than
other classes in the commrunity for the suýpport o! eduication. I agree with zny honourable friend that the problemi is not an easy
one. Whether or not it is desirable for the
f ederal-government to take a direct interest
in this subject, which provincial governirnents
bave in the past zealously guarded as being
within their own exclusive jurisdiotion, I cannot say. I rernember, though, that a few years
ago when a considerable increase in moneys
was made availiable from the federal treasury
ta the provinoes, one o! the strong arguments
advanced as ta the need >for increased, grants
was thie growing cosît of activities within the
peculiar sphere o! the provinces. Whet'ber or
not the federal government may at somie time
have to contribute -towards the .payment of
educationai casts directly, or indireotly by
increased grants to the -provinces, le a niatter
that will have to be left ta thje future. With
my honourable friends general thesis I agree.
I also agree w1th bis commente, that unemplioyment is undesirable and increased export
trade is desirable. The govertnment ie of -the

opinion that a great deal of existing unemployment is seasonal, and indeed there is
evidence already that on the west coast it has
reached its peak and is lessening in volume.
My honourable friend is quite right in his
view that some of the unemployment is flot
seasonal, but arises directly or indirectly from
the trade difficulties with which we are faced.
But 14is a source of wonder to me that up to
this date, alinost five years after the war, our
uTlemrployment has flot been a good deal
higher. When I think of the difficulties that
appeared to face us at the conclusion of the
conditions
war, as unstable
economic
threatened most countries of the worl and
our immediate task was the transîfer of a
million or more of our people from war industries and three-quarters of a million fromn the
forces back to peacetime activities, I marvel
that for so long a time we have had so relatively littie unemployment. Whatever the
future may hold for us, it is inevitable that
we shail have to face these problems in. the
light o! ail known circumstances and reekon
with them in the snost appropriate. manner.
The honourable leader opposite said that
Canada had now come pretty well to the
end o! her period of prosperity. I do not
share this pessimistic view. A careful study
of bis speeches since the end of the war
would disclose, I tbink, that he has periodically uttered such warnings. It is not reasonable to expect that our present unprecedented
prosperity will continue indeflnitely; I do
think, however, that despite the dark clouds
there is much reason for encouragement.
The honourable leader opposite suggested
that one cause for concern was that Canadians have exhausted their savings. True,
incomes bave at times been stimulated by tbe
return o! taxes and by sucb items as payments from the Wheat Board to the grain
growers. The honourable gentleman seemed
to think that such incidents had some connection with the approach of the recent
general election. I cannot agree with that
deduction; rather, I would consider these
incidents as coincidental with the election.
On the question o! personal savings, I would
draw my friend's attention to the fact that
one o! tbe by-products of the war years was
tbe habit o! saving. The vast amounts of
money saved by the Canadian people during
that period were largely invested In government bonds, tbe sale of which was reflected
in increased savings deposits. The continued
increase in savings accounts in Canadian
banks, and the reception accorded to the issues
of savings bonds, indicate a continuance of
the saving habit throughout the post-war
period.
I would commend to honourable senators a
recent publication by the Bureau of Statistice,

SENATE
comprising a valuable compilation of facts
about our present financial position. According to this document, the savings of the people
of Canada at the half-way mark of the
twentieth century far exceed any amount
reached in the pre-war years.
The fears expressed by the honourable
leader opposite bring to my mind a subject
which I should like to discuss briefly, namely,
the nature of our prosperity during the past
few years and our prospects for the future.
In this regard I assure my honourable friends
that I speak more as an individual than as
a member of the government with some
special knowledge. I would suggest that there
are three reasons for the pattern of our
present prosperity: first, the very large volume of export trade; second, the huge capital investment in Canada; and, third, the
distribution of the income of Canadian citizens from those two sources on a reasonably
fair and equitable basis, with the result that
there was a high consumption of goods and
services.
Though various factors will influence our
future, the degree to which we can adopt the
pattern to which I have referred will furnish
the answer, relatively, at least, as to whether
or not our prosperity will continue. The main
key to prosperity is a satisfactory volume of
export trade. If our trade appears likely to
continue, the resulting confidence may well
be the deciding factor in the continuance of
capital investment in Canada. To the extent
that we can inspire confidence, capital investments will continue, and to the extent that we
can maintain a reasonable distribution of
income, we can look forward, under any circumstances, to reasonably happy conditions.
It is desirable, honourable senators, that
Canada maintain a satisfactory volume of
trade, for this will influence our economy
far beyond the dollar value. There are two
reasons for this. The first is that the pattern of industry and employment has for a
long time been built around certain products
of industry which have been produced in
such volume as to be in excess of our ability
to consume them. The second is that it will
be desirable under all circumstances for us
to import a large volume of products, and to
provide for international payments such as
the expenditures of our nationals travelling
abroad and interest and dividends on foreign
capital invested in Canada, plus payments for
such services as freight and shipping antd
other miscellaneous obligations. The combined cost of these items has been substantial; indeed, in 1949 it was only slightly less
than $4 billion.
It is quite possible that an enlarged manufacturing industry in Canada, together with

the improving skills of our people, will result
in the manufacture in this country in the
future of some of the goods which heretofore
we have imported. On the other hand, a
prosperous economy results in an everincreasing demand, in both volume and
variety for goods and services. It must be
borne in mind further that in recent years the
importation of goods into Canada has, for
various reasons, been severely curtailed.
It is of course true that for the discharge
of our obligations there are available to us
sources of revenue. These include receipts
from the sale of non-monetary gold, tourist
expenditures by those visiting Canada, interest and dividends accruing to our nationals
through investments abroad, freight and shipping revenues and other miscellaneous
receipts. During 1949, of a total revenue from
these sources of $4 billion, exports of goods
exclusive of non-monetary gold accounted for
almost $3 billion. This is a very substantial
figure as compared with less than $1 billion
in 1939.
In considering our future economic development, the major problem facing Canada is
how co maintain this volume and value of
exports and, if possible, increase it. I know
of no problem more challenging; and it can
well be the subject of a most penetrating and
constructive examination and study. Export
trade is vital to our economy; but we would
be foolish not to admit that its maintenance at
a high level presents many complications. Our
large volume of export trade of recent years
was made possible by an extraordinary
demand in the export market at a time when
competitive sources of supply had not recovered from the effects of total war. To a certain extent it was attributable to the fact
that we in Canada loaned to our customers
part of the means necessary to pay for these
exports, and also to the fact that the United
States of America, through the Marshall plan,
made certain moneys available for the same
purpose.
Although the desirability of maintaining
this volume of exports continues, we are faced
with the fact that the credits which we have
made available are almost exhausted; that
assistance from the United States of America
under the present Marshall plan will cease in
1952; and that alternative sources of supply
are becoming available to those who have
been purchasers from us in recent years.
Honourable senators, with your indulgence
I will pause for a moment to draw attention
to a very distinguished group of visitors to
Canada who have just entered the gallery.
They are a delegation of Japanese members
of parliament.

in the delegation are members of the Secretariat of the Japanese Diet, who are concerned with administrative questions. The
delegation has been visiting the United States
Congress and State Legisiatures.
On behaîf of this house-and perhaps my
honourable friend the leader of the opposition would like ta associate himself with
me in my remarks-I extend ta these visiting
members of parliament; and those associated
with them, aur heartiest welcome.
Somne Han. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: We wish themn well
in the great experiment upan which. they
are embarking, and if there is anything in
our pracedure or experience which may be
useful ta them, we shall be happy ta make
it available ta them. I might remark, hawever, that, in view of the long experience
of the East in ail matters of public cancern,
it may not be long before we shauld make
a visit ta aur eastern friends ta benefit from
what they, tao, have discovered.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I jain'the leader of the government in welcaming ta aur chamber these distinguished
parliamentarians from Japan. Within recent
years we were at war with that great nation,
and we did aur best ta prevail. We are now
at peace; and I jain with ather memnbers of
this house and with ail aur people in the
hope that a peace treaty with Japan will
soan be adopted and that in its new parliament Japan, as an independent nation, will
pattern its affairs on a democratic system
similar ta those at work in Canada, the
United States, Great Britain and other democratic countries. In Canada we believe In
democracy not for purposes of democracy
but for purposes of freedom, whereby ail men
and wamen have rights, and each has the
same rights as any other.
We Canadians welcome these distinguished
visitors lrom the Island Kingdom. We hope
they wiil gain samething fram thefr experience here, and that Canada and, Japan, as

27

two of the world's Pacific peoples, will soan
be able to trade together ta their common
advantage.
On behaif of the party of which I have
the honaur ta be leader, and perhaps I may
speak also for the whale house, I wiil say
that we as Canadians want ail the world
ta be free. We do flot believe in the system.
under which same of the world's democracies
are being carried an: we hold that ail men*
and wamen should have the right ta live
their lives in freedom under the law.
Again, an behaif of the party that I represent, I wish aur visitors a pleasant and
educative time in Canada and a safe jaurney
home. I hope they wifl carry ta their people
the good wishes of aur own.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: We must bear in
mind, honourable senators, that as we return
ta normal peace-time conditions, campetition
in the export; markets of the world wil
become increasingly keen. The aver-al
problemn is ta attempt ta shape aur national
policies while taking ail facts into consideratian.
What is the nature of the goads and services
which we are mast likely ta be able ta
How are we ta be
supply competitively?
paid for them in a manner which wiil enable
us ta discharge aur awn obligations? The
pattern of aur exports in 1949 is relatively
-clear. Agricultural products and those related
thereto accounted for over one-third of aur
$3 billion of exports; the praducts of aur
forests, ta something less than one-third;
and the product of aur mines, ta appraximately the samne amaunt; misceilaneous
items making up the balance. In any passible pattern for the future, it will probably
be found that the major natural resources,
whîch. we enjoy in such abundance, wil
form. the basis fram which we can prodýuce
competitively the goods we *are mast llkely
ta seil in export markets.' It is highly likely
that, based on our natural resources, we
shal be able ta praduce céompetitivel y a surplus of goods aver aur needs. The prablem.
is whether we can market these goods, and~
this problemn will revolve araund future
international tracle arrangements and the
ability of our potential custamers ta pay.
Forgetting for the moment the manner of
payment, so far as aur'national payments
were concerned the over-ail relation between
aur receipts and expenditures in 1949 was
reasonably satisfactary.
Our excess of
imports fram. the United States over aur
exports ta that country was in the neighbouron
haod of $450 million. We expart ed $1 billi.
worth of goods ta the United Kingdom. and
the countries* of the Commonwealth and
Empire, -and we -bought fromn themn goods ta

SENATE
a value of less than one-half this amount.
To all other countries we exported goods to
an amount of about $160 million more than
we purchased from them.
Under conditions prevailing in pre-World
War II days, this over-all picture would have
been reasonably satisfactory, and perhaps we
could have continued to look forward to an
uninterrupted continuation of this desirable
condition. At that time the problem of payment as between the dollar and the sterling
areas presented no material difficulties,
because the huge revenue which Britain
received from her investments abroad made
it relatively easy for ber to pay for ber purchases from dollar areas. But as my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) pointed
out, not only were those investments lost to
Great Britain, but she incurred a tremendous
liability in her sterling balance. This liability is somewhere in the vicinity of $12
billion, and Great Britain, rightly or wrongly,
has undertaken in recent years to liquidate it
because of the insistent warnings from the
East to the effect that if it were not liquidated
communism might spread. I cannot vouch
for the accuracy of the figure, but a prominent
Canadian economist told a Montreal Board of
Trade meeting that Britain's international
balances-taking into consideration actual
investments sacrificed during the war and
obligations imposed-are something in the
neighbourhood of $25 billion. When one
realizes the interest lost on the actual investments and the obligations incurred by the
sterling balances, one wonders why our
pattern of trade was not upset to a greater
degree.
As I said before, in pre-World War II days,
the problem of payment as between the dollar
and the sterling areas presented no material
difficulties because the huge revenue which
Britain received from her investments abroad
provided her with the income which enabled
her to pay for her purchases from the dollar
areas. Unfortunately, that is a thing of the
past. Hereafter, unless the volume of our
exports to the sterling areas is to be drastically reduced, we must establish a much
closer balance between what we buy and
what we sell.
If we can look forward to a vast increase
of our exports to the United States that will
probably simplify matters greatly. However,
there has been an increasing realization that,
in future, in the interests of all concerned,
it will be necessary for us to import more
from the sterling areas if we are to maintain our present rate of exports; and certain
efforts are being put forward in this direction.
I do not need to point out that many difficulties will be encountered here. The simple

truth is that in the main-except in specialty
lines-the sterling areas have never sold goods
in any great volume to this country or the
United States. Our present condition of selling more to Great Britain than we buy from
her is not new; it has existed in the lifetime
of everyone here. As I have said, in former
times Britain was able to pay for ber purchases from the dollar areas because of the
huge revenue she derived from ber overseas
investments.
However, that revenue no
longer exists, so the people of Britain are
now addressing themselves to the problem of
trying to produce goods of a quality and at
a price which will make them attractive to
the people of Canada.
The point raised by my honourable friend
has a bearing on this trade question, because
if Britain undertook to discharge ber obligations to the areas which hold these sterling
balances, and exported four or five hundred
million dollars' worth of goods, these goods
would not be available to the dollar areas.
Even if these goods became immediately
available to us, because of various underlying
problems, there is no certainty that it would
be possible to market them. There is the
fact that British industry is reluctant to commit itself too positively to cater to this
market, and this is a fundamental reason
why Canadians are reluctant to buy capital
goods from Britain. So it is not an easy task
to solve.
As I see it, we shall not remedy the situation unless we are prepared to lend money
to Great Britain to purchase our goods, or
unless the United States continues to supply
Great Britain with money to purchase American and Canadian goods. The old multilateral basis, whereby the interest on investments was a most important factor, no longer
exists and probably never will in our lifetime. The fact that last year we sold much
less to the United States than we imported
from that country has aggravated our currency difficulties. There are indications that
the American people are beginning to appreciate our problem in this respect, as well as
similar problems of other countries.
I agree with my honourable friend that we
might just as well advance credit to Britain
as take sterling in payment for our goods, and
at the moment that seems out of the question.
But it was not out of the question in the
United States. The other day I saw published
a statement that in the last thirty-five years
exports from the United States to all countries, including Canada, had exceéded imports
by $101 billion.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: What was the gross figure?

FEBRUARY 23. 1950
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The excess of Amenican exports over imports from January 1,
1914, was said ta be $101 billion. One of the
great facts facing the United States, and
indeed Canada, although the pattern here is
a little different, is that goods can only be
paid for, in the long run, by other goods.
Exchange of currency is simply a means of
facilitating transactions. As my honourable
friend says we might seil goods ta Britain
and receive payment in sterling, which would
be of no use ta us. In efTect, and in the long
run, we can get paid for aur own goods only
by accepting other goods. But on this side
of the water there is reluctance ta import
more than very limited quantities of goods
from Europe, although Canada does flot seem
ta be as reluctant ta import from the United
States.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I amn still a free trader.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has my honourable
friend not overlooked the effect of rents and
dividends upon United Kingdomn trade?
Britain's excess of imports over exports was
paid for by credits received from hier investments of money abroad.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, I agree. Those
investments financed very large purchases by
Britain from the United States. As honourable senators know, the amount of American
money invested abroad is relativeiy smaii.
I arn distinguishing naw between moneys
advanced by the Amenican gavernrnent and
the investment of private capital. I understand that the total of capital investments
by the United States in f oreign cauntries is in
the arder of $10 billion, of which more than
half-I think some $6 billion-is in Canada.
My honaurable friend made one suggestion
with which I entirely disagree, and it has ta
do with a matter of great importance. As I
understood him-and if I arn wrong hie will
correct me-le suggested that there could be
no permanent solution of our trade difficulties
unless currencies were allowed to reach their
awn levels. He said that originally, though
not an advocate of camplete lack of contral,
he had favoured a devaluation of aur maney
in ternis of the United States dollar, but that
afterwards he had fallen under the sway of
the eloquence of the honourable gentleman
tram, Toranta-Trinity ffHon. Mr. Roebuck)
and naw believed in total relaxation of ail
currency contrais. As I say, if I arn wrong
in my statement my honourable friend will
correct me.
Now, honourable senators, I thi'nk that thé
proposai for camplete relaxation of currency
controls is both unrealistic and undesirable.
It is unrealistic because of the simple tact
that if we eliminate ail contrai over currency

in this country we must cease ta be part of
the International Monetary Fund, whose
members have agreed ta currency contrai. At
the moment I amn not arguing the merits of
that organization, but it seems ta me that
there must be contrai ta some degree if we
are ta participate in international collaboration for the stabilizing o! business. It is true
that the countries participating in the international agreement are permitted a certain
range within which they may devalue their
respective currencies without in any way
failing ta live up ta their obligations. If I
remember correctly, the lirait of devaluation
that may be made in this way is 10 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: But if a country is able
ta convince the other participating members
that its economy is in a state of fundamental
disequilibrium, it may be permitted ta, devalue
its currency more than 10 per cent. Any country receiving the International Fund's. permission to do this does not expose itself ta
the risk af retaliatory action on the part of
other countries through the imposition of
dumping duties against it. Now apparentiy
Britain was able ta show her economic situation ta be s0 seriaus that she was allowed
ta devalue lier currency by 30, per cent in
relation ta the American dollar, and of course
the approval by the International Fund of this
devaluation meant that dumping duties would
not be imposed against British good-s coming
into other countries belon-ging ta the organization. Bec-ause we kept aur devaluation within
the permitted range of 10 per cent, we did
flot need ta, get the tund's approval. Had we
desired ta devalue, by 15 per cent or 20 per
cent, we shouid have had to appeal ta the
fund and atternpt ta prove that our economic
condition made the required devaluation
esseutial. I very mucli doubt if we could have
made a case for devaluation beyond 10 per
cent.
The devaluatian of Canadian currency by
10 per cent at the time of the British devaluation of 30 per cent was made voluntarily by
this country, but there was some difference
of opinion as ta the wisdom of aur course.
For my part, as I believe I have stated here
bef are, I was disappointed that we devalued
aur money at all. I think that in the long
run we would have been better off had we
not dione so. However, that La a matter o!
opinion.
But, getting back ta my hanourable friend's
suggestion, I do not; think we could have
remaved ail contrai over aur eurrency and
stili remajned part of t>hat; international organizatian of which Britain and the United States
are alsa members. I suppose the United States
is probably the leading nation in the great

SENATE
effort to stabilize trade. I suggest to this
house that if we had decided to ignore the
International Fund and allowed our currency
to find its own level, we might have invited
consequences that would have been far from
happy for this country.
I do not pretend to be a prophet, but let
us consider what would happen if we tore
up our international agreements. The effect
would be the devaluation of our money by
perhaps 25 to 35 per cent. Somebody may
say that we could impose dumping duties of
25 to 35 per cent against American goods,
and this would be all to the good because it
would make our people buy more goods at
home. I must confess that such an argument
does not appeal to me. Our economy, as
evidenced during exchange restrictions, is so
tied up with that of the United States that
our very industrial existence depends upon
harmony with that country. I would hate to
see added to our present tariff structure a
further increase of from 20 to 3,O per cent,
with a consequent increase in our living
costs.
I believe that in due course conditions will
right themselves, but that artificial protection for industry would result in chaos.
Some people may point to the financial advantage to Canada of being able to dump ber
goods on the American market, which would
be in direct contradiction with agreements
between the countries of the western world,
including the United States; but is it practicable for us to believe that the American
Congress would be indifferent toward such
a policy on our part,. and would not request
an increase of tariffs on the ground of unfair
competition? Indeed, their attitude towards
us would most likely be that Canada was
not playing the game with the rest of the
world. J am merely expressing my views on
this controversial question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my friend
to ask him a question? When our exchange
was at par with that of the United States,
did not the honourable leader of the government oppose my suggestion of a 10 per cent
reduction?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As far as I am concerned, it was just a stronger argument

against a bad policy. I regret the 10 per
cent devaluation in our currency, in addition
to the tariffs already imposed. It just means
that industry and individuals in Canada are
paying more for imports from the United
States, and I do not believe in it.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not propose to
labour the point, but I warn honourable senators that it would be very dangerous for the
business interests of this country to suggest
that there is no need for improving our
products or reducing our costs of production
in the hope of gaining new markets, that all
we have to do is wait until this or some other
government decides to throw out controls.
It has been suggested to me at different
times that the Senate of Canada could render
a worthwhile service by inquiring into our
vital trade problems. Would not an intensive
investigation, looking broadly into the trade
questions of the next five or ten years be an
excellent contribution to industry and business generally? For instance, in western
Canada huge discoveries of oil have been
made, and there is concern about whether
it can be exported to the United States. Also,
great quantities of iron ore have been discovered in Labrador. These commodities can
be produced in quantities far in excess of
Canada's ability to consume them. Our whole
future is dependent upon our ability to maintain a satisfactory volume of exports to be
sold in the competitive markets of the world.
A proper level of export trade is the key to
continued capital expenditures. Beyond that,
I hope our judgment will continue sound, so
as to assure a reasonable distribution of the
proceeds from the development and export
of our natural resources.
Though Canada may suffer ups and downs
in her economic life, if her trade affairs are
properly managed I cannot envisage her as
suffering a serious depression.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, February 27, at 8 p.m.

THE SENATE

The Senate met at 8 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 8, an Act to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators it is important that this measure
be considered as early as possible, and if the
house sees fit I should like to proceed with
the second reading this evening. Therefore,
with leave of the Senate, I move the second
reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Honourable senators, may
I be permitted to ask whether this bill provides unemployment insurance for hospital
employees?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I shall first explain
the bill, and then answer my honourable
friend's question.
This bill, copies of which are on all honourable senators' desks, is entitled an Act to
amend the Unemployment Insurance Act,
1940. This country is possessed of one of the
most comprehensive unemployment schemes
to be found anywhere in the world. The
passage of the Unemployment Insurance Act
in 1940 established a first line of defence
against an unemploymènt crisis. It now provides protection for approximately two and
a half million workers, and in addition
affords protection to the dependents of these
workers, who number over four and a half
million. There are thus some seven million
Canadian people who constantly possess, as
a matter of right, a considerable measure of
protection against the fear and want that
result from unemployment. More than $223
million has been paid out in benefits since
the Act came into force.
One of the most important results of the
passage of the Act has been the administrative organization which has been set up
across the country. With branches in every
major centre of employment. This organization, which is well informed, provides a

highly efficient method by which the government can measure the import of any employment crisis, and take immediate action to
stem any abnormal advance of unemployment.
As we all know, the coming of winter in
Canada brings great changes in the employment pattern; many forms of employment
cease, and others begin. Reports from all
sections of Canada make it evident that there
is at present a considerable slump in employment. Past experience indicates that this
slump is something that we can expect with
the coming of each winter season, but that
this condition is usually alleviated to a great
extent with the arrival of spring.
The purpose of the bill before us is to give
added protection to the unemployed during
the months when employment is at its lowest
point, namely, in the period of from January
1 to March 31 of each year. This added protection would take the form of supplementary
payments to persons who under the present
act are not receiving benefits during the
winter period. To receive this supplementary
payment an unemployed person must have
engaged in an industry or an occupation
which comes under the Unemployment J nsurance Act.
Four classes of persons would be eligible:
Class 1: Persons who have exhausted their
benefits under the Act.
Class 2: Persons who have not made the minimum number of contributions to qualify thesa for
payments under the Act.
Class 3: Persons who were employed in
or lumbering occupations for a minimum of 30 days
in any twelve-month period during the 18 months
preceding-the date of application for benfits.

loggng

I may. say that persons in class 3 are in a
special category; the logging and liumbering
industry in eastern Canada will not come
under provisions of this Act uîntil April 1.
This date is too late to enable the unemployed
in these industries to be brought under the
provision for supplemental payments for the
coming month of March. Il was therefore
necessary to make this added provision to
help them this year. British Columbia lumbering and logging industries have been
subject to the Act since 1946.
Class 4. Persons who since the 31st day of March
preceding their applications for benefits have
worked a minimum of ninety days in an industry
which has been made an insurable employment in
the twelve-month period preceding the date of such
applications.

The supplementary benefit rates payable
will be 80 per cent of the standard benefit
rates authorized under the Act. Provision is
made for financing these supplementary benefits by increasing the contributions. Employees
and employers will have to pay an additional
one cent a day. The government will pay

SENATE
one-fifth of the additional employer-employee
contribution into the Unemployment Insurance Fund. In addition, the government will
pay the total cost of benefits paid to persons
in classes 3 and 4. This is because these
groups have not had time to make the necessary contributions to the fund. Although
these financial provisions seem adequate, the
government will, in addition, guarantee the
Unemployment Insurance Fund against any
loss sustained on account of supplementary
payments up to March 31, 1952.
As I have said, the whole purpose of this
legislation is to make the Unemployment
Insurance Act conform more closely to our
normal pattern of Canadian employment.
As of February 2 this year there were
approximately 375,000 persons unemployed,
125,000 of whom were not in receipt of
unemployment insurance benefits. It is
expected that the bill before us will bring
100,000 of those who are not at present in
receipt of benefits under the Act, and so make
possible supplementary payments to them.
The bill will also make effective certain
other recommendations of the Unemployment
Insurance Commission. For instance, the
existing Act insures salaried employees whose
annual earnings are $3,120 or less. It is proposed in this bill to raise the maximum to
$4,800 per annum.
Most of these other amendments of the
Act have to do with the mechanics of its
operation.
There is one substantive amendment which
would increase from $1.50 to $2.00 per day
the amount which may be earned by any
person in receipt of unemployment insurance.
I might also mention that payment of'supplementary benefits will not affect in any way
the future contributions of persons receiving
such benefits.
If the bill should receive second reading
this evening, I should like to have it referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, and if the committee can meet
tomorrow morning, I hope to have in attendance the Parliamentary Secretary of the
Department of Labour and the Deputy
Minister of Labour, as well as other officials,
so that questions of a more detailed character
which honourable senators may like to ask
can be intelligently answered. I shall do my
best to answer any questions put to me, but
I would ask the indulgence of the bouse
because I am not an expert on all the items
in this measure.
Before resuming my seat I should like to
answer the question asked by the honourable
senator from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Davis).
As I understand it, this legislation does not

provide for bringing under the Act a class
of employees such as hospital workers. This
would have to be done by proclamation. The
bill before us is a general over-riding measure
which deals with the various benefits provided
certain classes who now come under the Act.
Hon. Mr. Davis: I assume that at the
meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committee tomorrow I can inquire wlat plans
there are, if any, with regard to the class of
employee I refer to.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That would be a perfectly legitiýmate inquiry. Whether this class
should be brought under the Act may be a
question of government policy.
Hon. Mr. Davis: The reason for my inquiry
is that a number of hospitals in our province
are very much concerned about the increase
in their operating costs, and they are desirous
of obtaining some information about this at
an early date.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
in the absence of the Ijonourable leader of
this side of the house (Hon. Mr. Haig) I wish
to make some remarks in connection with this
bill before it receives second reading. It will
be realized from the explanation which has
just been given that this is an important bill,
and that it contains many intricate sections.
I have read the bill several times, and have
not only listened to what took place in the
other chamber but have read the report of the
debate there, and like my honourable friend
from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Davis) I have
quite a number of questions that I should like
to ask when the bill goes before the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Before dealing with the principle of the
bill I should like to make some general
remarks about unemployment insurance.
H,onourable members will recall that in 1935
the first Unemployment Insurance Bill was
introduced into parliament by the then Bennett government, and was passed under the
peace, order and good government clauses of
the British North America Act, which the
then government thought gave parliament the
right to pass the bill. There was a change of
government shortly after that, however, and
the whole matter was referred to the Supreme
Court of Canada and then to the Privy Council, and it was held that the Act was ultra
vires of the powers of this parliament.
Between 1935 and 1940 many talks took place
between the federal government and the
provinces, with the result that in 1940 an
amendment was made to the British North
America Act giving the federal government
power 'to pass legislation of this kind. The
Unemployment Insurance Act was passed in
1940 and came into force on the 1st of July,
1941.

FEBRUARY 27, 1950
The honourable leader is perfectly correct
in stating that, including workers and dependents, about seven million persons were given
some sort of protection under this Act. The
first benefits were paid in 1942, and since thait
time the benefits paid out have amounted to
more than $200 million. That seems to me to
be a large sum, considering that from 1940 up
to the present time we have had what many
people regard as almost full employment.
My honourable colleagues on this side of
the chamber are somewhat -concerned over
the fact that at present we have a great deal
of unemployment in our fair country. The
registered number of unemployed at the
moment is 375,000, but many are not registered. I know that in the part of Saskatchewan from which I come a large number of
people who might be entitled to benefits under
this Act have never taken the trouble to
regdster. I am of the opinion that instead of
3'D5,000, the number of unemployed just now
is at least 400,000.
We are also of the opinion that much of
this unemployment is not seasonal. During
the great depression of the 30's the number
of unemployed in Canada was only- about
twice 400,000, and surely, if there are 400,000
out of work in this period of practically full
employment, it cannot be said that the
inability of all of them to find work is
attributable to seasonal conditions.
Hon. Mr. Wood: We have three million
more people now.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We have more people,
it is true, but still 400,000 would seem to
be a very large number of unemployed for
this period. It is too bad that we have now
to consider a feeble substitute for work,
instead of legislation creating work. Surely
an attempt to find work for our people is the
major job of the Canadian parliament. I
do not think we should wait until matters
get worse. The government should heed the
warnings-and I think they are heeding
them at present-but we on this side would
like to know what are the government's
plans for the future.
After these few introductory remarks I
should like to discuss the principle of the
present measure. Aside from what may be
said as to some features of the bill, I do
not think that any of us have any serious
objection to the principle. The measure was
forecast in the Speech from the Throne, in
these words:
However, seasonal and local factors have given
rise to a significant amount of temporary regional
unemployment during the past few months and the
security provisions established under unemployment insurance legislation have been called upon
to meet the first important test since they were
brought into effect.

Although a high proportion of persons temporarily
unemployed are actually in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, you will be asked to give
consideration to a bill to widen the scope and
extend the benefits of unemployment insurance.

Honourable members on this side of the
bouse desire to facilitate the passage of this
bill, for it has quite a number of features
which we think wil be helpful; but it goes
much farther than the Speech from the
Throne led us to believe it would. For
example, in seven or eight respects it amounts
to practically complete overhauling of the
unemployment insurance law:
1. The rates of contribution are changed
and raised, and contributions between employer and employee are equalized. Honourable members who read the bill will find
that 6 cents a week is added to the present
contribution of both the employer and employee.
2. Statutory conditions are enlarged by
increasing the periods of contribution.
3. Outside permissible earnings are increased from $1.50 a day to $2. This has
already been pointed out by the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
4. The rates of benefit have been changed.
5. Additional penalties and powers of inspection have been added.
6. There is a change with respect to the
waiting days.
7. The advisory committee has been increased from six to eight members. Besides
these there are many other changes, about
which honourable senators may wish to ask
questions in committee tomorrow. It seems
to me that employers and employees should
have been called in and consulted by the
government before so many changes were
made in the Act, and then we would have
had their advice and opinions as to what
was best to be done.
I have previously stated that the bill is
very complicated and that many points need
clarification. In addition to what I have
already mentioned, there are several new
features. The Act has been made applicable
to a new group, persons with a salary of
over $3,120 and up to $4,800. This group
will number some 90,000 people, and at
$1.08 a week their contribution will mean an
additional $5 million per year in payments
to the fund. The majority of these people
will never be unemployed, but still they
are compelled to make this contribution.
Hon. Mr. Horner: A special tax.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: This is a special tax
imposed upon them by the measure. If this
bill becomes law $34,320,000 will be collected
between July 1, 1950 and March 31, 1952.

SENATE
0f this amount the empioyees will pay

Hon. Mr. Robertson:

Honourable senators,

$13,912,500; a similar arnount will be paid by I have not got a precise answer for my honthe employers, and the governrnent will contribute $5,560,000.
According to departrnental records, the
number of registered earners or ernpioyees
under the Act is 2,750,000, but the Labour
Gazette states the number is 3,594,000, which
is 844,000 more than the departmental figure.
1 shouid like to ask tomorrow which of these
figures is correct.
A f urther new feature provided for by the
bill is the protection of the seasonally unemployed during the period frorn January 1 to
March 31 of each year. This year the
period will be from March 31 to April 15.
I wish to draw attention to the fact that
under the present Unemployment Insurance
Act a large number of people who have paid
into the fund for years, anid who are now
sick or incapacitated in some way and are not
seeking employment, will get no benefits from
the fund. I think the government should
consider that point and do something about it.
ln my opinion the bill does not go far
enough. I think the benefits should be
extended, as was originaily intended, not
only to those persons now includ ed, but to
ail classes of employed persons.
Those, honourable senators, are ail the
remarks I wish to make at the present time.
I should like to be present when the bill is
considered in committee tomorrow. to ask
questions on many of the sections which I
do not fully understand. I arn sure there
are other honourable senators who, like
myseif, do flot fully understand ail the proviilons of this bill. I trust that the departmental officiais will bie able to give us the
required information.
As I have already said, I want to facilitate
as much as possible the passage of this
bill. 1 understand that the government feels
that it is necessary to commence payments
on March 1, and I do flot think that the
senators on the opposition side of the house
will oppose second reading tonight.
Hon. J. P. Hawden: Honourable senators,
I should like to follow up the remarks of my
honourable coileague from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Davis) on the question of the eiigibility
of hospital employees.
I gather from reading the bill that the
ordinary employees of hospitais are not to
be included under this legisiation. I know
that the St. Boniface hospital, which is one
of the iargest institutions of its kind in
Manitoba, and even in Canada, is opposed to
having its ernployees included in this scheme.
1 thought perhaps the honourable leader
might make a statement on the position
of hospital employees.

ourable friend's question, but the bill as I
understand it has nothing to do with the
admission into the insurance seheme of any
particular class of workers. I believe that
new classes of employees are admitted by
proclamation by the government.

per cent of the population?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I arn sure that opinions
vary greatiy as to, what is the criýtîcal point
in the unemployýment picture. I suppose it is
critical to the persan who is out of a job,
whether the total unernployment be 1 per
cent or 9 per cent of the population. We couid
take the figure that I gave as of February 2,
which, I arn informed, was largely seasona]
unemployrnent. My information is that by
reason of the coid weather which visited the
summer-like province of British Columbia an
extreme amount of unemployrnent was
experienced in that area. The high peak
reached in that province may have been
bal'anced by conditions in other parts of
Canada. As I say I amn not in a position to
give a ýprecise answer to what is the critical
point of unempioyment. In my opinion one
must consider the particular area, and
whether the problem is a ternporary one, and
will evaporate with the winter snows. I arn

quite sure that the officiais who appear bef are
the committee tomorraw morning will be
qualified ta answer my friencVs question. If
the figure were 10 per cent, there might be a
million and a quarter people unemployed.
The num-ber we now have, as stated by the
acting leader of the opposition, is 375,000.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I realize that second reading
is nat the proper time ta ask questions, but
the inquiry I have in mindi is a very pertinent
one. I want ta make one remark with regard
ta a statement of the acting leader of the
opposition. Having been a member in the
other place of the committee which. considered, the original Act, let me say that it
was neyer intended, either then or now, that
the Unemployment Insurance Act should be
a substitute for work. Time and again, here,
in the other place, and outside, the opposition
have asserted that this legisiation is ail the
governmnent had to off er the unemployed. But
the purpose of the Act was net ta provide
employment. When, in 1940, that Act was
before parliament, employment was at its
peak and wages were high; and it was
intended that a fund should be built up
which. would serve as a bulwark when it was
needed,; and that is exactly how it has
worked.
No'w tihere are forces at work in this country that for their own ends are making capital
of the unemployment situation. While the
exceptional -ieather conditions are not wholly
accauntable for the nuxnber of unemployed,
they have aifected enployment ta quite an
extenct. For example, for a long time there
was ne snow in certain parts o! east central
and eastern Canada, anid this condition
deprived many men o! work. Also, British
Columbia has had one o! the most severe
winters in aur experience; in fact I have had
ta suifer two winters, because I had one out
west and found another when I came here.
The mils in my city were shut down, and
thousands were idle. Those who want ta take
adîvantage of this condition are saying "«The
depression has started again"; they are crying
"Wolf! Wolf". But I believe that if the number o! unem.played in Canada were counted
today there would be a different picture from.
that of a month aga.
I want ta offer one criticismn which I
believe is legitimate and fair as I say, I was
a member of the committee which. was
associated with the beginning of this legislatian and, as one who still holds an active
union. card, I believe that in the light of
present conditions in Canada, apart from the
unemployment situation, the government
made a mistake in not having consulted
labour in connection wlth the draftlng of this
bull. 1 wil tell you why I think sa. The
government represented in this chamber

failed ta recognize that two types of. labour
are operating in Canada. One type belongs
to the L.P.P., many of whose members take
their orders from Soviet Russia. The other
is the legitimate element in labour, which. is
battling the group that wants ta overthrow
aur demacratic system. I f eel that the gavernment has not recognized or given encourage-ý
ment ta that section of labour thraughaut
Canada which is in favour of aur present
demacratic system. Labour was called in
and consulted in connection with the original
Act, and anyone who bas looked through it
can see that there are many changes which
indicate the participation of these sound
labour elements.
This sort of insurance is different fram
ardinary if e insurance or fire insurance.
For example, if a house is insured, there are
reciprocal obligations and benefits, whereas
under the provisions of this bill hundreds
of people who contribute ta the fund will
rxever receive from it one five cent piece.
A definite *change, neyer cantemplated in
the original bil, relates ta what is known
as "suitaible" employment. What Is "suitable"
employment?
Some official has authority
ta tell a man whether he shali go fram here
ta there, and whether this or that employment
is "suitable"l emplayment or not.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The word "1suitable"l was
always in the statute, was it not?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do nat think so. When
I read the bil, just this afternaan, the phrase
seemed new ta me. I may be wrong: the
question can be lef t ta the leader af the
government and the committee.
My question ta the leader of the government is, why should this bill not be sent ta
the Committee on Immigration and Labour?
It is a labour bill.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Before the leader replies,
I wish ta say one word ta the honaurable
senator fram New Westminster (Han. Mr.
Reid). He has spoken of people who by
disruptive methods are causing trouble amang
the unemplayed. What happened in Regina
when a government of different palitical
views was in power? Notwithstanding that
the sole purpase of the organization he mentianed was ta seize power in this country,
ail the gavernment of that day gat from the
then opposition was the most diabolical
campaign of abuse that was ever known in
any democracy. Now, it is the snow that
causes unemployment; then, it was nothing
but the gavernment.
Hon. Mr. Robertson- With reference ta
the suggestion that labour was nat consulted
in connection with this bil, I do not wish at
this time ta dilate upon the extent ta which

SENATE

there has been consultation: I would prefer
that my honourable friend suspend his
criticism until we have an opportunity, perhaps tomorrow, to ask questions on the
matter. I believe it will then become apparent that representatives of labour were
invited to assist in connection with many
of the details, particularly the mechanics of
the measure.
As to my reason for not suggesting that
the bill be sent to the Committee on Immigration and Labour, let me say that had
that committee been set up I should have
been only too happy to refer the bill to it.
Unfortunately, for reasons beyond my control, that committee has not yet been constituted, so I have no alternative, should the
bouse see fit to give the bill second reading,
but to refer it to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce. I believe that any
like legislation in future could very properly
go to the Committee on Immigration and
Labour.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

PUBLIC LANDS GRANTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill B, an Act respecting
Grants of Public Lands.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill and
the next one on the Order Paper are not in
themselves of any great import, but in order
to facilitate the clearing of our Order Paper
I would ask honourable senators, if they see
fit after hearing the explanations to give these
bills second reading tonight. Then, if honourable senators require it, the bills could be
sent tomorrow to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce, where additional information
could be obtained.
Honourable senators, the purpose of the
bill now before us is to revise and consolidate
into one measure the present Public Lands
Grants Act and the Ordnance and Admiralty
Lands Act.
The present Public Lands Grants Act
empowers the Governor in Council to convey
an interest in land held by His Majesty in the
right of the Dominion of Canada; it applies
to all lands with respect to the conveyance of
which there is no other statutory provision.
There are several Acts which provide for the
transfer of an interest in land that comes
within their purview. The Dominion Lands
Act is one of these. It specifically provides for
the conveyance of an interest in land that is
under its control. The Public Lands Grants

FEBRUARY 27,

Act might be regarded as a residuary measure
that guarantees the power of the Governor in
Council to give good title to all Crown lands.
The Ordnance and Admiralty Lands Act has
to do with Crown lands that are necessary for
the defence of Canada. It provides that the
Governor in Council may direct that any
Crown land be declared to be necessary for
the defence of Canada. Such land may not
then be sold, but it may be leased, rented or
occupied in some manner short of sale, as the
Governor in Council directs. Attached toi
this Act there is a schedule setting out the
lands at present declared to be necessary for
the defence of Canada.
This bill incorporates all the main provisions in the Acts I have just mentioned. Sections 1 to 6, inclusive, incorporate the present
provisions of the Public Lands Grants Act, in
slightly amended form.
Section 3 of the present Act applies only to
four provinces. The new section 3 is intended
to apply to all the provinces that have abolished words of limitation in their conveyancing.
Paragraph (b) of section 4 is new. It provides that the Governor in Council may make

FEBRUARY 27, 1950
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
in continuing this debate, I wish first to congratulate with all sincerity the mover (Hon.
Mr. Golding) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Veniot) of the address on the splendid
speeches they made. Also, I wish to call the
attention of this honourable body to a problem that exists in the southern part of the
prairie provinces, which is of national importance and, I am pleased to say, is not being
altogether overlooked.
Experience over the past forty years has
shown that in the section of the country I
have referred to the moisture coming from
the sky during the growing season is not
sufficient to produce food crops. Many farmers are still living in the short grass areas,
but in eleven of the past thirteen years, as a
result of hot winds and drought they have met
with failure and disappointment.
The Government of Canada last year paid
the sum of $14 million to 60,730 farmers,
because the yield on their farms was less than
8 bushels per acre, and in many cases it was
less than 4 bushels per acre.
The people of this area settled there in good
faith; they worked hard and became attached
to their homes; but many of them are now
convinced that they must move out. They
should not be forced out, as were the Acadians
removed from the land of Evangeline. They
should not be scattered to distant areas far
away from roads and without schools, hospitals, churches and stores. They can be
removed to areas where all the benefits of
community life may be enjoyed, if irrigation
is provided.
Irrigation is nothing new. In all ages and
in many parts of the world rainfall has been
fitful and even absent during the growing
season. Under these circumstances irrigation
had to be resorted to in order to produce
crops. Irrigation farming is as old as civilization itself. It was used by the Incas in South
America before the Spaniards came. In Bible
days Egypt, because of the flooding of the
Nile was the granary of the Roman empire. In
that land of pyramids a canal that was constructed 4,000 years ago still carries water to
the thirsty land. Egypt's seven and one third
million acres of irrigated land has time and
again saved the people from famine and
economic disaster.
Canada has from one-half to three quarters
of a million acres under irrigation, compared
with one million acres in Australia and fiftyfive million acres in India. China, as far
back as her records go, has maintained an
extensive irrigation system in the rice-producing area. Irrigation is employed in
Africa for the growing of fruits, especially

dates. Irrigation is made use of in Asia in
the growing of mulberry for the silk worms;
in Spain, for oranges; and in California about
46 per cent of the great fruit crop is grown
on irrigated land.
Irrigation has been most successful in the
United States. About one hundred years ago
the Mormons, after suffering untold hardship
in their march across the continent, settled
in Salt Lake Valley. It was then a desert,
but by irrigating the land they turned it into
a veritable paradise. They succeeded in supporting a population of 175,000 with only two
acres to each individual. Horace Greeley, the
editor of the Tribune, once said, "Go West,
young man, go West". He had in mind the
great benefits of irrigation in the western
states. He was one of the first promoters of the
Colorado scheme, away back in 1870. Since
that time the canals have been extended, and
the western states have become noted for
their watered gardens and orchards. There
are now in the United States 28,000,000 acres
under irrigation-about nine-tenths by the
gravity method, and about one-tenth by
pumps.
Here in Canada, flowing to Hudson Bay, we
have water in rivers and the streams which,
if harnessed and used, would irrigate about
2,000,000 acres of land; and if that land were
irrigated people would flock to it, because
people will go where there is food in abundance and where food is easily produced.
I should like to indicate and illustrate what
can be done by recording what has been done
in a small area close to where I live. In
southern Alberta there is a tract of about
25,000 acres known as the Rolling Hills. Until
a few years ago it produced nothing but a
few cactus plants and clumps of sagebrush.
It was a grim, desolate area. The roads were
dry and dusty; there was no sign of human
habitation anywhere. A broken-down deserted
shack, or the whitened bones of some animal
that had perished, were the only signs that
people had ever tried to live in that district.
The land was fertile and there was lots of
sunshine: what was needed was moisture.
Water was turned in, and a great transformation followed. In friendly co-operation the
governments brought to these irrigated lands
some farmers from dried-out areas. They
arranged that the land vacated would be
taken out of cultivation and used for community pasturage. They provided that the
lands these people were moved to would be
irrigated, and the northwest quarter of each
section was reserved for persons experienced
in irrigation, so that proper practices would
be followed. Of the first one hundred families that were moved there, only two had any

The bill was read the first time.

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, in
rising to take part in this debate I want to
deal first with certain remarks made by the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) who I am sorry to see is not in
his place. However, the only difference his
absence may make, so far as I am concerned,
is that I might say what I have to say with
a little more vigour if he were here. During
his speech he dealt at some length with communism in this country and the dangers of
communism. I say to him and to all honourable senators that many of us in this country
are not thinking clearly on this matter, and
it is about time that we did. In the early
days of the rise of communism the believers
in that philosophy were disciples of Karl
Marx, and those who worked behind the
scenes in Russia for the overthrow of that
country believed in the doctrine of Marx,
"Unto each man his needs." But what happened in Russia after some of those people
came into power? There was a great fight
for control, a fight that continued until Soviet
Russia had not a communistic government at
all, but a Stalinist or Police State government.
We in Canada had better get it clear in our
minds that in this country there is a difference
between the philosophy of those who believe
in communism and those who-some of them
belonging to the L.P.P.-are taking their
orders from Moscow for the overthrow of our
Canadian democratie system. I think we
might do well to consider this matter more
clearly than we have in the past.
I was somewhat amused by the honourable
gentleman's referencès to communistic representatives in the Winnipeg city council and
the Manitoba legislature. He said they were
out to spend all they could of the taxpayers'
money with a view to causing disruption.
Well, I have looked over the expenditures of
the provincial government and the municipalities of the province from which I come,
and I flnd that they are on one of the biggest
spending sprees in the history of the province.
The spendings by t;ie provincial government
have jumped in the last four years from $68
million to $102 million; but no one would
accuse that government of being communistic
at all. And neither can anyone say that the
municipalities have become communistic in
thought. What the public of this country
need to do is to take a greater interest in

FEBRUARY 28, 1950
their own affairs, for after ail there is anly
one source of payment for ail these expenditures, namely, taxes and more taxes, ail of
whikh are collected from the people.
A reference made by the honourable senator to our new province, Newfoundland, was
most unfortunate, and perhaps was a slip of
the tongue. I learned frorn my experience
in another place that it does not do to make
jocular remarks. 1 well remember rnaking
a speech there flot long ago in which, after
quoting fromn a French language newspaper
in the province of Quebec, I apologized for
not being able to speak French and, just as
a mere asîde, said I had enough difficulty
learning Engiish, without attempting to learn
another language. Well, shartiy afterwards
I was amazed to read a letter in a British
Columbia newspaper stating that the electors
of my constituency had sent to Ottawa a man
who could flot speak the English language.
Since that Uirne I have been somewhat careful
of the remarks I have made. There are no
finer people in this country than the people
fromn Newfoundland.
Somne Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have flot had the pleasure
of visiting that province, but I have read
some of its history. I believe that its people
are the last bulwark of rugged individualisrn.
They have built Up their province in the
face of rnost adverse circumstances. During
the first two hundred ytars of the colony's
existence Great Britain put every obstacle in
the way to prevent British people from
settling in Newfoundland.
I have most friendly feelings toward the
people of our new province, and 1 say to the
honourable senators who corne from there
that we in British Columbia have many
things in common with them, more perhaps
than with the people of other provinces. Some
people think that now we have brought Newfoundland into confederation we can f orget
about it. I hope we will not do thiat. Had
Newfoundland been in confederation from its
early days, the Canadian governrnent would
have spent a great deai of money to give to
the people of that province things which up to
the present time they have not enjoyed, and
perhaps wrn flot enjoy for some time to corne.
The people of Newfoundland hold the gate
of Canada on the east, and we in British
Columbia guard the portai to the Pacifie. I
think that as time goes on it wil be f ound
that the portai on the Pacific wifl reach a
zenith which wiil make it the equal of any
port on the Atlantic.
The leader opposite <Hon. Mr. Haig) and
some other senators have had much to say
55950--5

about trade. Ail of us realize, of course, that
no country depends more upon her trade than
does Canada. The United States, with their
huge resources, have a large consuming population. Canada has only thirteen and a haîf
million people. While solutions are being
suggested for our trade problems we must
not forget that to dAe, whether we like it or
not, the country to the south of us is in the
driver's seat.
There is scarcely a nation in the world
today which is not receiving assistance in
sorne f orm from the United States. Part of
our present prosperity is due to the fact that
Great Britain has been able ta purchase
wheat and other products with Marshall
Plan aid. Most countries are worried about
what is going to happen when Marshall Plan
aid ceases.
Perhaps what I arn about ta say next may
displease some members of the government,
but I take the position that in the interests of
the people of Canada I have the right to say
certain things to the government, not in a
destructive criticai sense, but by way of
drawing their attention to certain conditions
and perhaps offering some advice or assistance. I have in my hand a report of a statement made recentiy by the Prime Minister on
the question of trade. If I arn not within the
rules of the bouse in reading it, his Honour
the Speaker can stop me. The Prime Minister
said:
For the good of the nation ini general. we want
an increase in the exports of Great Britain to aurselves ... Sa that the price of these Imports can
be converted Into dollars usable to pay for the
surpluses we mnust continue ta expart to the United
Klngdom.
Such distress ta a few Canadian industries is
somethlng which is unfortunate and whlch has ta
be canaidered. We have to attempt to deal with
it, but we must not atternpt ta deal with it in a
way that wauld shut out auch British Importa from
our country because they are harmful ta some of
aur local Industries.
I say, honourabie senators, that Great
Britain should be encouraged ta send us

goods such as machinery and steel, rather
than textiles, towels and similar articles. The
fact is well known that if Canada is flooded
with textiles and toweis from Great Britain
many Canadian factories wili be closed.
It is in this connection that I wish ta draw
the attention of honourable senators ta what
the Prime Minister had to say, and ta point
out what sorne governiment boards are doing
ta disrupt the idea which he put forward.
Ia passing may I point out that Canada's
per capita expenditure ini the United States
last year was $126, as cornpared with a per
capita expenditure in Canada by the United
States of only $8. 1 ernphasize the fact that

SENATE
the United States is in the driver's seat, and
that as she is our close and friendly neighbour, rather than rebel against that condition
we must try to put our own house in order.
For some time the attention of the entire
North American continent has been centred
on the strike in the American coal mines.
Certain Canadian cities fear that if the
trouble continues they will be short of coal.
I am wondering whether everything that
could be done has been done to produce and
use more Canadian coal, so that we would
not have to import such great quantities from
the United States. I notice by the report of
the Dominion Coal Board that last year
Canada's total coal consumption was slightly
more than 47 million tons. Of this total
slightly more than 18 million tons was Canadian coal, and the balance of about 29 million
tons was imported.
We in British Columbia produce a bituminous coal, quantities of which used to be
exported to Japan and other countries, but a
short time ago a deal was made whereby
what is called "Red China" would supply
Japan with coal, and British Columbia lost a
market which she had held for many years.
True, only some 280,000 tons per year went
to Japan, but even this was a great help to
the coal miners of the Pacific coast.
Parliament last year passed a bill which
provided for loans of approximately $10 million to assist in the purchase of better machinery by the Maritime coal operators. When
they get into full production I trust that the
people of this country will use more Canadian coal and import less from the United
States. The supplying of Canadian consumers with oil from the Alberta fields will
considerably reduce our purchases of that
commodity from the United States.
I turn now to what I consider is a more
serious matter. The Prime Minister is telling
us that we should buy more goods from
Great Britain to help balance what she buys
from us. As honourable senators know,
Great Britain's purchases from Canada last
year amounted to almost $400 million
more than our purchases from her. My particular attention was recently drawn to an
article appearing in the Toronto Saturday
Night, to the effect that a body known as
the C.B.C., when buying television equipment
for the cities of Toronto and Montreal, never
gave the British a chance to tender. Now,
does anyone say that Britain is backward in
the field of television? I have just been
reading something of ber development in this
field, and in many respects she is far ahead
of the United States. British manufacturers
of modern, up-to-date television sets and
machinery have in Toronto a properly established agency, known as the Pye Company.

Do you suppose, honourable senators, that
even this company was allowed to tender on
the television equipment required by the
C.B.C.? No: The corporation decided to buy
these sets from the United States. I should
like to know whether the C.B.C., as would be
the case with an ordinary business, would
have to obtain an import licence for this
transaction, or is this organization above the
law when it decides to buy this kind of
material? It is high time that the government and the people of this country took
note that we are setting up boards and administrators who are practically defying governments and are ignoring our democratic forms
of control. I draw the attention of the government to this particular situation because
to me it is a shocking state of affairs when a
company established here with up-to-date
television equipment is not even given a
chance of tendering on material required by
the C.B.C.
I am very glad indeed that it has been
proposed to set up a committee on the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and I
hope that the leader of the government in
this house will press to have members of
the Senate included in that committee.
For, after all, the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation is a body set up by parliament,
not by the government, and all of us are
concerned in its operation, especially when
it asks for more money, as it is now doing,
and seeks the consent of the government to
an increase in the radio licence fee. I
wonder whether any of you have looked over
the recent reports of the C.B.C. If so, you
may see where that body is going financially
and where it will end if we give it more
money. The grand total of all C.B.C. expenditures last year was close to eleven and
a half million dollars. In 1944 its expenditures were five and a half million dollars.
The more money these people get, the more
they want; and the money can come from
only one source, namely from the taxpayers
of this country. It is high time to call a halt
to this trend.
According to a clipping I have here, the
government intends to add three thousand
persons to the staff of the Income Tax branch.
I trust that when this generation passes
away it will not be true of them, as of a
generation mentioned in Holy Writ, that
the hand of the tax-gatherer was heavy in
the land. With many exempt from payment
of income tax the burden falls mainly on a
smaller group, and the manner in which
expenditures are increasing, both provincial
and federal, particularly federal, suggests a
parallel between those ancient days and our
own.

FEBRUARY 28, 1950
When, foliowing the end of the war, many
boards ceased to operate, I supposed that
there would be a considerable exodus from
Ottawa and therefore, plenty of vacant homes
and apartments. But if you look around and
inquire today you will find that the housing
situation in this city is even worse than it
was before the war, because those who
came here are staying. It is well known
that a government can hire but that it neyer
can fire. And now we are to have another
three thousand people to develop even more
extensively the work of the Income Tax
Branch.
I invite honourabie senators to giance at
the increasing proportion of uncontroliable.
as compared with controliable, expenises of
government, and the trend it indicates. Back
in 1939 the uncontroilabie expenses of this
country absorbed roughiy 55 per cent of our
tax revenues. The proportion has increased
now to over 60 per cent. This means that so
rnuch less money is availabie for controllable
expenditures, such as public works and other
government activities. 1 arn not going to
take time this afternoon to read ail the items,
because the list is a formidable one, but if
honourabie senators will examine the figures
for themselves, I believe they will come to
the same conclusion as I have, that we are
increasing our spending very rapidly. Unless
a hait is calied, I fear for the businssa
and the individuai taxpayer who will be
calleci upon to carry the cost of ail this
spend'ing by government and government
boards.
I said at the opening of my address, that
we ini British Columbia have much in coinmon with the good people of Newfoundland.
That is especially true in the matter of
fisheries. 1 intend to devote a few minutes
to this subi ect for it is one to which I have
given some study, and perhaps I may mention
for the information of some honourable
senators that I hoid at this tirne the position
of chairman of the international Pacifie
Salmon Fisheries Commission.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Reid: I was delighted a f ew deys
ago to hear the honourable member from
Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Veniot) say what he dld
about the Minister of Fisheries. It was an act
of singular graclousness on the part of one
who lives in another province to refer in such
glowing terms, and rightly sa, to a Minister
of Fisheries fromn British Columbia. Since
his appointment the minister has done many
splendid things. This is the more ta bis
credit when one remembers that for many
long years the Department of Fisheries was
one of the "orphans" Of the government.
Those of, us who have given the department
55950-51

somne study know that its staff of experts was
neither so large nor so capable as those of
some other departments. In this department
a tradition has persisted which, for the good
of the fisheries of Canada, the present minister
is endeavouring to overcome.
I was looking up some figures in the last
report on fisheries, and I think they may
interest honourable senators.
In the ten
provinces over 80,000 persons are employed
in the fishing industry.
The total suin
invested in vessels, boats and processing
plants is roughly $65 million; and the value
of the fish landed on the shore, before it is
processed, is between $70 million and $80
million. The market value of course runs
considerabiy more than this figure, because
much of the product is canned, and a considerable amount is placed on the market
either in a saited or frozen condition.
I do not believe that honourable members
from other provinces which have fisheries wil
take exception to what I have to Say on
behaif of British Columbia, because lt is flot
my desire to set one province against
another; but I would like to mention that our
Pacific province has one of the most wonderfui fisheries in the worid. Take the herring
fishery for insïtance. I feel sure that when
I tell you this you wili say "That is just a
fish story"l. But you will have some idea of
the herring fisheries of British Columbia
when I tell you that in one single catch 'a
seine boat took 1,600 tons of fish. This is a
type of fishing where 'the net-it is called -a
purse seine-is put around in a circle and the
bottom of the net is pulled shut. We have
been fishing on that scale for years, and so
far as officiais 'can-judge there is no diminution in, the numbers of herring. I arn not
going into the merits or demerits of bouýnties;
I arn merely giving you saniestatistics and
stating what took place.
I may be considered impertinent in giving
advice to the Maritimes, but 1 think it might
be better 'for the fishing industry if the
bounty were used in some different way. As
I contended in anather place, a baunty which
is spread out, $7 or $8 per man, is not being
used to the best advantage of the fisheries as
a whole, for is it being spent according to
the-recommendation of the commission which
investigated the matter many years ago. On
the other hand, I do say tb.at if the present
practice is to be continued, we in British
Columbia have a right ta the $200,000 or so
which is received each year from the United
States as aur 20 per cent share of the furs of
the seals killed and skinned on the Pribilof
Islands.
At one time we had a large sealing fleet of
seventy-five or more vessels, which went out

SENATE

into the open seas and intercepted the seals
as they were on their way to the breeding
grounds on the Pribilof Islands. This was
known as pelagic sealing, and under the
agreement with the United States Canada
agreed to prevent our fishermen from killing
these seals in open water when they were on
their way to their breeding grounds. As
compensation, the United States government
agreed to pay Canada 15 per cent-and later
20 per cent-of the value of skins taken each
year off the Pribilof Islands. Under this
arrangement the British Columbia fishing
industry has more claim to this money than
any other province. But I want to reiterate
my first proposal: that all such moneys should
be for the benefit of the fisheries as a whole.
After some years of studying the problem, it
is my belief that it might be advisable to
spend this money in some other way than by
simply making individual hand-outs.
At this point I also want -to commend the
Minister of Fisheries for the move which has
been made to teach the women in our Canadian households how to cook fish.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They should do something about the fish they serve in our
parliarnentary restaurant.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They could put a good dietitian in there to advantage. But I have something to s.ay about the fish itself. I do not
care how good your cooks or dietitians are,
they cannot make poor fish good to eat. I
wonder if I am safe in asking my friends
from the Maritimes and Manitoba why they
paint their fish and sell it as smoked fish?
It is all very well to ask the government and
the Minister of Fisheries why they do not do
thus and so, but the people handling the fish
go on doing the kind of thing I refer to irrespective of whether it ruins the fish or not.
The Winnipeg gold-eye and the Maritime fish
are made tough and almost indigestible by
this painting process, and it should not be
permissible to do this kind of thing to the
finest food which God has given us. Unlike
the products of the soil, which are affected by
nitrogen and fertilizers, fish is taken untouched
from the sea. It would seem that man is
perhaps thinking too much of profit, and
instead of using the old method of smoking
the fish be takes it to the painting shed,
paints it, and then sends it out as smoked
fish.
Honourable senators, another problem
facing the industry is the high cost of fish.
It is a difficult problem to solve, but there is
too great a spread between what the fisherman gets for his product and what the
consumer pays for it. It is all very well to

teach our womenfolk how to cook fish properly, but first of all they want to get good
fish, and furthermore, they want it at a
reason.able price. Do you think that the
average housewife would buy a pound of
fillet in preference to a pound of beef when
both are selling at, say, 50 cents a pound?
She would not. Yet here is a product which
has not cost man anything to grow. There
is no ploughing, seeding, reaping or harvesting to be done; there is only the processing
of the fish after it has been caught. Despite
this, fish is costing the consumers as much
as meat, so if we want to do something for
the fishing industry we should tackle this
problem.
It may be of interest to many honourable
senators to know something about the consumption of fish in Canada. Here are some
comparative figures: At the present time the
consumption of fish in the United Kingdom
is 35 pounds per capita.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Per year?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes. In the United States
it is 11 pounds 2 ounces; in France it is 12
pounds 1 ounce; in Denmark it is 35 pounds
9 ounces, and in Norway it is 46 pounds 7
ounces. Now, what I think we should do is
to put on a good advertising campaign to sell
fish to our people. This could be done to
great advantage by stressing the health-giving
qualities of fish. Incidentally, a similar campaign recently carried out in British Columbia
had amazing results. When it was discovered
that Great Britain was not going to buy any
more eggs from Canada, the poultrymen of
British Columbia were pretty perturbed, and
they were pleading with the government to
take their surplus eggs off their hands. Meetings were held throughout the lower part of
British Columbia, and when it was suggested
that a selling campaign be undertaken, there
were some who said that this was utter nonsense. Nevertheless, with the help of the
Department of Agriculture and moneys contributed by various associations, a vigorous
egg-selling campaign was put on in January,
and it went over so big that carloads of eggs
had to be brought in from Alberta and Saskatchewan to meet the demand. I believe the
same sort of campaign would be of tremendous
help in selling our fish. It would not hurt
our people to eat another half ounce of fish
daily. This would amount to only one pound
per person per month, but it would result in
a home market of 160 million pounds a year,
and this would eliminate much of the need for
outside markets.
I would suggest to the Department of
Fisheries and to the government generally
that serious consideration be given to the
inauguration of such a campaign, that some

FEERUARY 28, 1950
inquiry should be made with a view to
reducing the cost of fish to the consumer, and
that, if possible, a systemi should be established
whereby fish could be put on. sale in our
cities and towns whlle it is stili fresh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What is the per capita
consumption in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I arn glad my honourable
friend asked that, because I overlooked it.
The per capita consumption in Canada last
year was 12.2 pounds, of which 5-4 pounds
was canned fish, and 6.8 pounds, was made
UP of cured, frozen and fresh fish.
That
completes the picture for purposes of comparison with other countries.
The British Columbia fisheries face some
dangers, as do the fisheries on the Atlantic.
Here let me say to my friends from Newfoundland that. if I were giving them advice,
I would suggest that they request the govern.ment to have attached to the office of the
Secretary of State for External Aiffairs a
practical fisherman, competent; to advise our
representatives at international conferences.
Han. Mr. Duif: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Prior to Newfoundland's
entry into confederation Great Britain spoke
for the island at conferences having to do
with the North Atlantic fisheries; but now
Newfoundland should urge upon the federal
government the necessity of having competent
advisers at ail such conferences.
On the Pacific the dangers are twofold. 1
arn one of those who believe that the sooner
a peace treaty is signed with Japan the better.
Last year a special American fisheries mission
was invited by General MacArthur, the
Supreme Allied Commander in Japan, to
study the fisheries of that country. The
mission was composed of three men, al
experts in fisheries matters, and in my hand
I hold a copy of the report that they made
to the President of the United States. I wiil
read from it one paragraph:
Certain poicies deserve special consideration.
The mission is thoroughly convinced of the soundness of the position that the Japanese should flot
be permitted ta expand their deep sea fishing operations, under any circumnstances, until the Japanese
Government demonstrates its abllty to control its
fishermen and ta respect international obligations.
It Is feit to be of utmost importance to the entire
world fishery future that the sound position whlch
SCAP has taken in this matter be malntalned.
The initiais "SCAP" mean Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.
When discussing this matter with the honourable the Minister of Fisheries, I was very
pleased to hear from hlm that not long ago
he had visited Japan, and that he agreed with
the position taken on the matter by General
MacArthur. And indeed the consequences

may be serious for Canada, especially for
British Columbia, if a fisheries agreement
with Japan is not; made part of the peace
treaty. I have suggested to the government
that we should have present, to advise our
representative at the conference for the signing of the peace treaty, a man experienced in
the fisheries.
It is weil known to those of us from
British Columbia that prior to the outbreak
of the last war Japan had the largest flshing
fleet in the world, an industry in which one
million men were employed.
So-called
mother-ships came from. Japan, down Bristol
Bay and along the British Columbia coast,
presumably for the purpose of testing tides,ý
currents and the temperature of the water;
but it was noted that when they arrived at the
port of Seattle they had 20,000 or more cases
of canned salmon on board. Honourable members who have given the fisheries some study
may be interested in knowing that the Japanese have a technique of flshing with nets two
miles long.
After his appointment as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan General MacArthur established bounds withîn
Which Japanese fishermen were required to
stay. Did they stay within those bounds? No,
they did not. Only a short time ago Japanese
flshing boats were picked up a f ew miles off
Australia. 0f course, a protest was made to
General MacArthur, and when the boats
returned to Japan their owners were fined by
the Japanese Government.
Out on the Pacific we have what is cailed
the continental shelf, where our salmon feed.
Our great saimon fisheries, comprising five
varieties of salmon, provide a livelîhood for
thousands of fishermen. The United States
and Canada are taking about 47 million
pounds of halibut a year from certain areas
which would have been depleted of halibut
had an agreement or treaty between both
countries not been reached. What will our
position be if the peace treaty does not contain an agreement by the Japanese fishermen
not to pursue their occupation on our wvest
coast without regard to the quantities taken?
In the past the Japanese fishermen neyer were
conservationists. They used to take all they
could get. Their mother-ships, equipped to
stay out for a year, returned laden with fish.
So I say it is of the highest importance that
Canada be well represented at the peace conference by a fisheries expert. We need to
have there a competent man, one whose
experience has been on the practical side of
flshing, rather than someone whose knowledge has been gained solely in college. Sometimes I feel that today we are suffering from
too many theorists.

SENATE
I said that British Columbia was faced with
two dangers. The first of these-the possible
taking by foreign vessels of untold quantities
of fish from waters upon which Canadian
fishermen depend for their livelihood-very
likely confronts the Atlantic provinces as
well. British Columbia's second danger arises
from the recent move by the great aluminum
trust to capture inland waters for hydroelectric purposes. Huge dams are being contemplated in the interior, at Nechako and
Chilko. I will not engage in an extensive
discussion of the matter this afternoon, for I
expect to make more speeches. For the time
being I merely draw attention to these two
dangers. I may be reminded that water rights
are under the control of the province, and it
may be said that the federal government has
no power to interfere in this matter. That
may be right, but I prophesy that in days to
corne, after the Aluminum Company gets this
project in operation-if it ever does-the
federal government will be asked to investigate this company or cartel. I do not know
whether the public is aware that in 1944 the
company was investigated in the United
States. I have here a copy of the report of
that investigation. If this company, which is
power-hungry, gets away with its activities at
Nechako or Chilko, it will wipe out threequarters of the sockeye salmon fishing industry on the Fraser River.
A report was made on this question by the
Attorney-General of the United States, and
those of us who are believers in free enterprise should take note of it. Competition does
not automatically take its proper place just
because the war is over. The AttorneyGeneral of the United States in a letter
accompanying the report on the Aluminum
Company says:
Unless necessary measures are taken immediately,
independent businessmen will not have a fair opportunity in this industry ...

It may be true that in certain instances
cartels and combines have provided the
public with cheaper goods than might otherwise be produced. As one who believes in
freedom and free enterprise, I contend that
we must keep competition alive; but when
men bind themselves together, as this company has done, to keep others from coming
into the industry, that is leaning towards
I warn the people of this
communism.
country, particularly the people of British
Columbia, against what the government of

that province proposes to do in the way of
handing over one of its greatest heritages
to perhaps the largest combine in the world.
That organization controls aluminum resources not only in Canada but elsewhere
outside of this country. Some time ago it
grabbed off Arvida. I am not at all sure
that it cannot be blamed for stopping action
on the part of the United States in carrying
out the St. Lawrence Waterway Treaty, as
the carrying out of that scheme might interfere with its interests.
Honourable senators, I shall have more to
say about this subject later. For the present
I am content to lay these matters before you.
I hold the view that we are here with a
duty to perform, namely, to watch over the
rights of all the people. I do not say what
I have said because I am a member of the
Senate; those who sat with me in the other
house know that I have many times stood
up and fearlessly said what I believed to be
in the interests of the Canadian people. I
believe that every honourable senator will
agree that that is one of the duties which
we should unselfishly carry out.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
it was not my intention to take part in this
debate prior to our adjournment, so consequently I am not as well prepared to speak
as I might otherwise have been. However,
there are one or two matters which I wish to
bring to the attention of the house at this
time, so that the government may take some
action with respect to them.
First of all, I wish to say that I was
delighted with the speeches of the mover
(Hon. Mr. Golding) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Veniot) of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne; they were very
interesting and well in keeping with the
traditions of this chamber.
Yesterday I was somewhat amazed by the
statement of the honourable gentleman from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) about
what he called the "painted" fish from Manitoba. If the leader on this side 6f the bouse
(Hon. Mr. Haig) were present, I am sure
he would have some remarks to make about
these fish. No doubt the honourable gentleman was referring to that famous fish known
as the Winnipeg goldeye. Now, until it is
treated, the goldeye is just an ordinary fish.
What form the treatment takes I do not know,
but I think that when cured it is just about
the finest fish in the world.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Whenever I am on the
train in the vicinity of Winnipeg I take great
pleasure in ordering goldeyes, if they are on
the menu.

I should like now to place on the record
some information which I obtained yesterday
at the Banking and Commerce Committee
when the Unemployment Insurance Bill was
being considered there. The total of contributions made to the Unemployment Insurance
fund by employers and employees in 1949
was $98 million. In addition, the government
contributed one-fifth of that amount, making
a grand total of contributions of about $120
million. But I was shocked to find that the
cost of administering the Act was $17 million.
That is approximately 15 per cent of the total
contributions made by the public and by the
government. Surely this is something that
might be inquired into by one of the Senate
committees which are being set up to consider
departmental estimates. Of course, the $17
million was paid, not out of the fund but out
of consolidated revenue account. It is
expected that the 1950 contributions by the
public and the government will amount to
$150 million, so honourable senators will see
that unemployment insurance is one of the
big businesses carried on in this country.
My chief purpose in speaking today is to
deal with some phases of the Income Tax
Act. A short time ago the Income Tax Appeal
Board brought down a decision in the case
of Reinhorn versus the Minister of National
Revenue. I am not criticizing the decision in
any way; in fact, I think the decision is- correct, having regard to the way in which the
relevant section of the Act now reads, but it
will have a tremendous effect upon the
economy of the western provinces.
Let me give a brief summary of the facts
of the case. Reinhorn purchased a service
station and garage property from the McCollFrontenac Company for $50,000 of which
$10,000 was to be interest. When Reinhorn
filed his income tax return for the year he
deducted $1,385 for interest paid on his agreement for sale. Ordinarily that was a proper
deduction, as we interpreted the Act. The
same procedure was followed by, for instance,
a purchaser of land who bought on a deferred
payment plan. In his income tax return he
would include as part of the.cost of earning
the income for the year the interest paid on
the agreement for sale. In the Reinhorn case
the appeal board decided that the amount
involved was not borrowed money at all, and
that under sub-section 1 of section 5 of the
Act the deduction could not be allowed.
Mr. Monet, a member of the board, gave
the decision, and a similar decision was given
by Mr. Fisher. I should like to read from
the report, as follows:
To benefit from the provisions of section 5 (1) '(b)
of the Income War Tax Act, the interest referred to

In this section must have been paid in connection

follows:
5. (1) "'Income' as hereinbefore defined shall
for the purpose of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:
(b) Such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed

relationship of borrower and lender to be able
to benefit frcm the exemption provided.

The decision in the Reinhorn case followed
that of the case of J. E. McCool Limited vs.
the Minister of National Revenue, decided by
the Exchequer Court in 1948, and cited in the
reports for that year at page 548. The decisions completely change the whole situation
in so far as the people in western Canada are
concerned. For instance, when a farmer buys
machinery on a large scale he usually buys
on time. A farmer who purchases a combine
for, say, $4,000, and has not got the money
to pay for it and cannot borrow it, pays
approximately one-third of the amount and
gets an agreement for sale from the company
for the balance, which he pays off at so much
a year, with interest at 5, 6 or 7 per cent. He
has followed the practice of including in his
expenses for the year the interest paid on the
machinery agreement. The same procedure
would apply to a farmer who purchased a
truck to carry on his farming operations. The
practice has been to show as a deduction in
his income return .each year the interest content of the payments. Also, when a farmer
purchases a section of land, 640 acres, and
agrees to pay $30,000 for it, he cannot borrow
the entire amount required to pay for that
land. Probably he will pay half cash. The
remaining $15,000 is secured by an agreement
of

sale whereLnder he agrees to pay the

Mr. Reinhorn's appeal was disnissed. I do
not suppose there will be an appeal to a
higher court, because the decision is right in
line with the section I have mentioned. The
interest paid to the vendor will be shown in
his return and he will pay income tax on the
interest; but the poor purchaser is in a very
different position-he pays the interest out of
income and is taxed on the whole of the
income without any deduction for the interest
content. In effect we have, therefore, in the
cases I have mentioned, a form of double
taxation.
I would ask the leader of the government to
have this matter brought to the attention of
the Minister of National Revenue with a view
to the introduction of an amendment to cover
such cases, because, if I am right in my interpretation of the law as it stands, this is something which affects the whole economy of
Western Canada and, probably, other parts of
Canada as well. As I have said, we who
carry on farming cannot borrow all the money
we use in -purchasing things; we have not
anyone to borrow it from; and under the Act,
to be able to deduct the amount of interest
paid, we must have borrowed the money on
a mortgage or something of that kind. It is a
very serious natter for us, and one which
I would not like to have stand over until we
come back: in the meantime the government
may be preparing some amendments of the
Income Tax Act, and if they are, I hope this
matter will be righted.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: To make sure I understand the point stated by the honourable
senator, may I ask if, in the case he has cited,
the court refused to allow the interest as a
charge by reason of the form of the transaction rather than its substance? In other
words, had the purchaser paid cash and then
borrowed money on a mortgage, the deduction would have been proper.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is correct.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is so. In giving

Mr. Leger: It

MARCH 1, 1950
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not know that it is
technical. Apparently it is in accordance with
the law as the law stands now.
Hon. Mr. Leger: What is the section?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Section 5, subsection
1 (b).
Hon. Mr. Leger: Have you the text of the
seotion?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I read it.
"Income" as hereinbefore defined shal for the
purpose of this act be subject to the following
exemptions and deductions:
(b) Such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed
capital used in the business to earn the income as
the Minister in his discretion may alow . . .
Under the circumstances of the Reinhorn
case and other cases which I have mentioned,
the decision is that this money was not borrowed and therefore the interest is not
deductible. I say that it is impossible for us
who are doing business in Western Canada
to borrow enough money by way of mortgage
to comply with section 5.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Would it not be possible
to state in the agreement that so much money
is for interest?.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That would not make
any difference. Every agreement for sale
provides that the price is so much and that
the purchaser agrees to pay interest on the
purchase price at a certain rate, annually or
semi-annually, or in some other manner. It
is definitely stated in the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Baird: The purchaser admits that
it is interest.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In this case he admits it
is interest.
As I said, this is a very important matter
so far as the western provinces are concerned.
I hope the government will give it consideration. I do not know that any of the old
income tax returns which have been filed
under the circumstances I have outlined have
been opened up; I understand it is the intention of the government not to open them up.
But we are afraid that this year, when we file
these returns showing deductions for interest
paid on agreements for the sale of land,
machinery, and that kind of thing, they will
be sent back to us amended and that our
farmers will have to pay income tax on the
interest which they have paid out in the process of earning the income.
I have some other points to mention in connection with the Income Tax Act. I have in
my hand a brief which I prepared, and which
you will pardon me, honourable senators, if
I refer to in a little more detail than I have
done in my other remarks. I wish to draw
attention to the matter of the time for filing

income tax returns. As is well known,
corporations file their returns at a certain
time, individuals at another time, and so on.
The point I want to make is that it would
clear up a lot of misunderstanding and difficulty if the dates for filing all returns were
made uniform.
Under the present Income Tax Act,
corporation taxpayers are required to file
their income tax returns, T.2 and TP.2,
within six months from the end of their
business year, while unincorporated taxpayers are required to file their income tax
returns, T.1, by April 30, or within four
months after the end of the calendar year.
There appears to be some discrimination here,
because there are more unincorporated businesses than incorporated businesses; furthermore, some unincorporated businesses are
just as large as many incorporated businesses.
Public accountants and others who prepare
financial statements and income tax returns
for taxpayers are striving to render a service
to the public and to the Income Tax Department, but it is becoming increasingly difficult
to meet the deadlines for filing returns which
the government imposes. There is no doubt
that this problem arises all across Canada,
but it is extremely noticeable in the West,
where there are long distances to be travelled
and where the weather is extremely cold during the four months allowed for filing the
returns of unincorporated businesses. I would
point out to honourable senators that the
mean temperature in the three prairie provinces during January and February of this
year was 25 or more degrees below zero. This
meant that the farmers who habitually commence to have their income tax returns prepared during these months, were only able
to visit town once or twice during the whole
period. In addition, the fact that the Canadian National Railways curtailed passenger
service by 50 per cent in some western
districts added to travel difficulties. During
April of 1948, when fiood conditions were
general in the West, the government gave the
unincorporated businesses an extension of
one month; but the point is that a crisis was
necessary to bring this change about.
Another factor that arises in connection
with extending the filing date of unincorporated businesses to six months from the end of
the business year, is that very often the
income tax forms are not available for the
use of the taxpayer until a month or so after
the new calendar year has elapsed. For
example, this year the forms were not available until the end of January. Then, again,
the requirement of filing six months after
the end of the unincorporated businesses'
year would in many cases bring the filing
date sooner. In the case of an unincorporated

SENATE

business whose year ends January 31, 1948,
a return does not have to be filed until April
30, 1949, or fifteen months after its year-end.
On the other hand, if the year-end of an
incorporated business is January 31, 1948,
the return must be filed within six months,
or not later than July 31, 1948. Why should
there be any difference?
As to the matter of prepayment of income
tax, under the present Act, unincorporated
businesses-excepting
farmers-must pay
their tax in quarterly instalments which are
due on March 31, June 30, September 30,
and December 31. Any balance due is payable not later than April 30. On the other
handi, an incorporated business pays by
monthly instalments: one half the tax before
the year-end, or within six months, and one
half after the year-end or within six months.
Therefore, under the present Act, the unincorporated business is supposed to pay its
total tax by December 31, while an incorporated business pays only one-half its tax
before December 31 and one-half after that
date. Why should there be any difference
here? In each case the taxpayer calculates
the tax payable on the basis of the previous
taxable income or, if the current tax is
expected to be lower, he estimates it. If he
does neither of these things, he is subject to
a penalty for interest. Farms are exempt
from these regulations, but are required ta
pay two-thirds of their tax by December 31.
Honourable senators, those are some of the
matters about which I intended to speak
after our adjournment, but I thought they
were important enough to be brought to the
attention of the government at this time. I
had intended to speak in detail about the
Crowsnest Pass rates but I shall leave that
until some future time.
Some Hon. Senajors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Frederick W. Pirie: Honourable senators, like my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) I had no intention
whatsoever of taking part in this debate at
the preseit time, but certain matters have
arisen which I think should be dealt with
before our adjournment.
First of all, I should like to make a statement and record some figures in order to
offset a one-sided story that is getting a great
deal of publicity these days in the United
States. In recent weeks certain sections of
the United States press have done Canada a
real disservice. What is more deplorable,
certain United States senators and congressmen, while furthering their own personal
interests, have done likewise. They have al]
told just one side of an important story. I
refer to the unwarranted and exaggerated
stories of the export of Canadian potatoes

to the United States. In my capacity as a
senator, a humble farmer and an exporter
of potatoes, I feel it incumbent upon me to
challenge these statements and to attempt to
place what Americans are pleased to call
"the Canadian potato problem" in its proper
perspective. In order to do this, I should
like to discuss the subject briefly against
the general background of Canada-United
States trade, and deal with it as a particular
commodity problem.
In 1947 Canada purchased in the United
States goods to the value of $2 billion and
exported to the United States goods to the
value of $1 billion. Obviously, this could
not continue, and import restrictions were
set up and a campaign was organized to
expand our exports to the United States. As
a result of this, by 1949 we had raised our
exports to $1,524,000,000, although we were
still importing virtually $2 billion worth of
goods from the United States.
It is our over-all balance of trade with
the United States that conditions our ability
to trade with that country, and therefore it
is probably inappropriate to break down these
figures into commodity groups. Nevertheless,
because my main point of reference is our
potato exports, I should like to table some
recent statistics on the trade in fresh fruits
and vegetables that is carried on between
Canada and the United States. These figures
cover the five-year period from 1945 to 1949
inclusive.

In 1947 Canada was forced to protect her
deteriorating gold and United States dollar
position by checking the drain imposed by
heavy purchases from the United States as
opposed to a much lower volume of exports
to those markets. The import restrictions,
which were a necessary part of that program,
were announced as being temporary in
nature; and, as is well known, most of them
have now been removed or relaxed. Certainly,

MARCH 1. 1950
in the field of fresh fruits and vegetables,
controls are no longer imposed against United
States imports. In other words, we, like the
United States, have told the world that we
are pledged to a system of multilateral trade,
and as proof of our sincerity we have said to
our producers that because the position of
our reserves has improved we will no longer
maintain a control against United States
imports. In effect, we have refused to provide artificial protection for our fruit and
vegetable industry.
Unfortunately, the same evidence of good
intent is sometimes lacking in the United
States. It is true that some of their leaderssuch as Mr. Acheson, Secretary of State, and
Mr. Hoffman, Administrator of the European
Recovery Program-have warned the people
of the United States that if they wish to continue exporting at their present rate they
must increase their imports. They might
have said that if they wished to have 13
million Canadian people remain their best
customers by purchasing $2 billion worth of
their goods per annum they would have to
devise some means whereby the 150 million
people in the United States could increase
their present purchases of only $1½ billion in
Canada. It is true that we are encouraged by
the statements made by Mr. Acheson and
Mr. Hoffman, but their speeches can have
little meaning if various interests in the
United States, including some persons holding high political positions, campaign for
further artificial protection of United States
industry.
The United States is not a new market for
Canadian potatoes; the trade has been going
on for many years. It is true that in recent
years our exports have increased, b.ut this is
in line with the general increase in trade
between our two countries. For example,
Canada's over-all imports from the United
States totalled $1,954 million in 1949, compared with $497 million ten years previously.
Furthermore, a large portion of our potatoes
which are exported to the United States are
high-grade certified seed potatoes which, on
a quality basis alone, are preferred by United
States growers all the way from the southernmost states up to and including the state
of Maine.
It has been claimed that our Canadian
exports-will o permanent damage- to the
markets of the United States seed potato
growers, and I would suggest that, as long as
the United States seed potato producers are
content to sit on their farms and accept their
cheques from the United States Price Support
Administration rather than exert themselves
to the extent of seeking markets, the danger
to which they refer is indeed real.
55950-6 1

It should also be recognized that United
States producers are not without some considerable degree of protection. With the
exception of limited quotas of Canadian potatoes, which enter the United States at a tariff
rate of 37j cents per hundred pounds, the
remainder are subject to an assessment of 75
cents per hundred pounds. This is obviously
a very heavy . rate of duty, which was
designed to give the United States producer
a great deal of protection. Indeed, I do not
believe that in the whole Canadian tariff
structure there is one United States item
which is subject to as high a rate of duty
when imported into Canada.
Furthermore, we should not lose sight of
the fact that now, when our own producers
are forced to accept relatively low prices for
their potatoes, potatoes from the southern
states are entering Canada free of duty. I
think that in Montreal or Toronto today
I could buy American potatoes that have
come into this country duty free.
It cannot be denied that some Canadian
potatoes which enter the United States in
legitimate trade become directly or indirectly
a charge against the United States price support funds. But in this connection there are
two things to remember. First, the United
States price support program for potatoes was
not of our making, and our legitimate trade
should not suffer because of it; second, as long
as this country has a trading deficit with the
United States of nearly a half billion dollars
per annum, every cent spent by the United
States for Canadian produce will immediately
return to the United States as payment for
American goods which are currently entering
this country at a rate which establishes
Canada as the best customer of the United
States.
Honourable senators, I wanted to place my
views on this matter on the record. I should
like to deal with some other matters that
relate to the same subject, but I will not take
the time to do so today, for I know some
honourable members are eager to get away.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Pirie; Within the last few weeks
I have been deluged with American newspaper clippings criticizing Canadian exporters
for shipping Canadian potatoes into the
United States. These papers, however, say
nothing about the fact that American potatoes are being given away, or sold at 1 cent
a hundred pounds on foreign markets where
we have been doing business. I have had
cables from Lisbon, in Portugal, and from sections of Spain and other foreign countries
requesting prices on potatoes in cargo lots of
as much as 20,000 tons, and when we quoted
prices commensurate with the market in the

SENATE
Maritime Provinces and the rest of Canada
we were informed that American potatoes
were offered for very much less. The Americans are criticizing Canada for selfing, or
offering for sale, Canadian potatoes on the
Arnerican market at less than the price of
American potatoes, but they are overlooking
the fact that they have taken away from
Canada her export markets in other countries.
I should like to read one small extract from
the many paiper clippings I have here. This
particular excerpt was sent to me by an
American who, I think, realizes that the
criticism that is made is a lot of poppy-cock.
This excerpt reads:
Senator Clifton P. Anderson of New Mexico,
former Secretary of Agriculture, said that the
United States has far more potatoes than Canada,
and that Canada does not realize what she is letting
herseIf in for if the United States starts dumping
her surplus in Canada to get even.

Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What is the duty on potatoes going into the United States, 33 cents a
hundred pounds?
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Until a certain quota is
filled the duty is 37- cents a hundred pounds;
from that point on it is 75 cents per hundred
pounds. Today the seed and table stock
quotas have been filled, and the duty is 75
cents per hundred pounds.

THE LATE SENATOR LESAGE
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMOR'Y

Hon. Wishart McL. Roberison: Honourable
senators, I regret ta have ta officialiy announce
to this house that since we iast met we have
lost one of aur colleagues, the Honourable
Joseph Arthur Lesage, of The Gulf, who died
March 9, 1950, at the age of 68 years.
Senator Lesage was born at Louisville,
Quebec, on June 7, 1881, the son of Hercule
Lesage and his wif e, the former Emilie Caron.
He was educated at Louisville College and
Lavai Normal School, Quebec.
He became interested in the insurance
business, as a broker, and at the time of his
death was president of Lesage Prateau
Limited and of La Publication Cartier
Limitée.

Senator Lesage served as an alderman of
the City of Quebec from 1918 ta 1926. He
was summoned ta the Senate on March
3, 1944.
His wife, the former Emma Lachapelle, and
two sans, Dr. Rager Lesage and Notary
Fernand Lesage, survive him.
Our late calleague brought ta the Senate a
wide knowledge of public affairs, much business experience and a willingness at ail times
ta discharge any respansibility that was
assigned ta him. His geniai disposition and
friendly manner endeared him ta ail with
whom hie came in contact. H1e will be sorely
missed; and we extend ta his widow and
family aur sincerest sympathy in their great
bereavement.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
was not closely associated with the late
Senator Lesage, though naturaily we ail knew
him. H1e was very punctual in his attendance at this hause, and at aimost any time
when a debate was gaing on he could be
seen in his seat on the other side of this
chamber. He had just reached that stage in
this house when one becomes familiar with
its machinery. It is a difficuit house ta get

started in. In bodies where the members are
eiected for a definite term, one recagnizes
the passibility that a coileague may nat b<
returned for another term, that somebady
else may take his place. But in the Senate,
of which a man or woman remains a member as long as he or she lives, a newcomer
takes a littie langer ta become acquainted.
The late senator was a quiet man: he did
nat obtrude himself in discussions in comnmittee or anywhere else, and therefare it was
more than ordinarily difficult for others ta
become acquainted with him.
H1e was no doubt a distinguished son off the
province of Quebec, and hie brought ta this
chamber a fine business acumen.
I jain the leader of the go%(ernmcri- in
expressing ta his widow and his two sans aur
sincere sympathy. and aur appreciation off
the honaurabie service he rendered as a miemaber of this chamber.
(Translation):

Hon. Paul Henri Bouffard: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted ta add a word
to the very apt remarks which have just
been made by the leader of the government.
I knew Senator Lesage for mare than
twenty yýears. Thaugh he encountered difficulties at the beginning off his career, he soan
proved himseif a shrewd business man, a
man of sound judgment and of the utinast
reiiabiliLy. Those qualities accounted for bis
success.
For many years, he gave himself whaleheartedly ta the Liberal cause, either in the

aiways an effective front rank fighter. H1e
soan won the confidence of the leaders of his
party and became the chief arganizer for the
whole eastern section of the province of
Quebec.
I have had many opportunities ta appreciate
bis courage as weil as the swiftness and the
soundness of his decisions. Ail the Liberals,
and mare particulariy those who have warked
witb him, wili remember him as a staunch
friend, a kind heart and an untiring warker.
Ris sudden death wili leave a deep gap in
the affections of those wha knew him intimateiy. H1e was one of those men for whom

It is because of these qualities that he will
be remnembered and that his namne and his

I would like ta extend ta his wife and ta
his two sons aur deepest sympathy.

MARCH 14, 1950
(Text):

the present time, owners and holders of
timber limits have been unable to secure any
insurance against fire loss on their standing
timber. The Limitholders' Mutual Insurance
Company, which is a mutual organization, is
the first to enter this field. The only shareholders will be holders of timber limits.
I do not want to go into the details of this
bill. It was thoroughly explained in 1947 by
my honourable friend from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), whose explanation may be
found in Hansard of that year at page 458.
At the time of incorporation it was felt that
two years would be sufficient to sell the idea
to an important group of limitholders. It was
provided that before the company could commence operations the amount subscribed
would have to be $500,000. Up to the present
time the association has done a great deal of
work in developing the organization and in
trying to convince the limitholders of the
advantages of its protection. It has gained
much ground, but not sufficient to commence
operations. Limitholders in the province of
Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have
been approached, and I think that within a
short period of time sufficient companies will
be interested in this scheme to enable the
Limitholders' Mutual Insurance Company to
carry on its undertaking. Under the bill
passed on July 17, 1947, the company was to
commence operations within two years of that
date, but, as I have indicated, it was unable
to secure the necessary capital. It is now
necessary therefore, to ask parliament to
extend the time limit for two more years so
that the corporation will not die.
The company feels that within the next
two years it will have a sufficient number of
shareholders to enable it to carry on. The
real purpose of the bill before us is to extend
the time during which the company may start
operating.
The Department of Insurance has been consulted and has no objection to the extension
asked for in this measure, and I feel that it
is in the best interests of a very important
group of businessmen.
If it is the wish of honourable senators that
the bill be referred to a committee, I would
have no objection to such a proposal, though

INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has the leader of the government any information as to whether consideration has been given by the government
to the setting up of a joint committee to look
into the affairs of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
my honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) has drawn my attention to
this s4 oject on one or two previous occasions,
bLt I have iot taken any action because I
have felt that this house should organize a
committee of its own to consider this matter
rather than be represented by a few senators on a committee oi another house. As
I have already intimated, I am going to propose tomorrow that all the estimates, which
come to us early this year, be distributed
among our own various standing committees,
before which officiW and other witnesses may
be summoned. While I have no objection to
our members sitting on joint committees such
as the one on old age pensions, I should like
honourable senators to seriously consider the
desirability of having officials of the CBC
come before a Senate committee. If my suggestion does not appeal to honourable senators, I shall be quite willing to press as far
as possible for the appointment of honourable
senators to the relatively few committee seats
which may be apportioned to us in joint
committees. In view of the fact that we hope
to avail ourselves of the early tabling of the
estimates, I should like my honourable friend
to consider whether it would not be better for
us to examine witnesses in our own committee. I am of open mind on the subject,
but that is my answer to my honourable
friend.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Speaking for myself I should
be very pleased to accept the proposal of the
honourable leader. My main concern is that
the Senate have opportunity to examine the
workings and expenditures of the CBC.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I shall submit my suggestion tomorrow, and
then it will be for honourable senators to
accept it or reject it.

IMMIGRATION COMMITTEE
ADDITION

TO PERSONNEL

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move that the name
of the Honourable Senator Reid be added to
the list of senators serving on the Standing
Committee on Immigration and Labour.
The motion was agreed to.
IMMIGRATION
MOTION

Hon. Cairine Wilson moved:
That the Standing Committee on Immigration and
Labour be authorized and directed to examine into
the Immigration Act
(R.S.C. Chapter 93 and
amendments) its operation and administration and
the circumstances and conditions relating thereto
including:
(a) the desirability of admitting immigrants to
Canada.
(b) The type of immigrant which should be preferred, including origin, training and other characteristics.
(c) The availability of such immigrants for
admission.
(d) The facilities, resources and capacity of
Canada to absorb, employ and maintain such immigrants, and
(e) The appropriate terms and conditions of such
admission;
And that the said committee report its findings to
this house;
And that the said committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records.

She said: Honourable senators, I am indebted to the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) for the
resolution which stands in my name. As it
is in the same form in which it appeared on
four previous occasions it is scarcely necessary
for me to read it. On this occasion the motion
is seconded by the honourable senator from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon).
It must be very gratifying to the honourable
senators who faithfully attended the meetings
of the Committee on Immigration and Labour
to know that the government has now recognized the importance of immigration and has
framed a ministry of Immigration and Citizenship. It is important, therefore, not only that
we welcome people to our country, but that
we make of them loyal and industrious
Canadians.
- Many estimates have been made of the
number of the immigrants which Canada can
55950--6

satisfactorily absorb in any one year. I think
a fairly reasonable annual figure would be
about 200,000, or one and a half per cent of
the existing population. The highest figure,
125,414, was reached in the calendar year
1948. In 1946 some 51,000 persons emigrated
from the United Kingdom to Canada and in
1947 there were 46,057; but in 1949 there was
a sharp decrease to only 22,201. This drop is
attributed to the currency restrictions, which
now permit British emigrants to take out of
their country only $760 a year for a period of
four years.
There has never been a very appreciable
emigration from France, the French people
being allowed to bring with them not more
than $300.
Emigrants from the Netherlands may bring
only $100, but their financial difficulties have
been largely overcome by arrangements made
between Canada and the Netherlands government. In the Netherlands the selection of
prospective emigrants to this country is made
by the Netherlands Emigration Foundation.
Agriculturists desirous of coming to Canada
provide the foundation with full particulars
of their training and experience in agriculture
and of their families. A careful investigation
is made by the foundation to ensure that
these persons are bona Ide agriculturists.
Inquiries are also made about their standing
in their community. The foundation arranges
for their transportation, the cost of which is
borne by the emigrants. Full particulars concerning these prospective emigrants are forwarded to the Immigration Branch through
the office of the Agricultural Attaché of the
Netherlands Embassy in Ottawa, and they
and their families are medically examined
before the information I have referred to is
sent to Canada.
In Canada the movement is handled under
the nomination method, whereby individual
Canadian farmers make application for
Netherlands agriculturists. Each application
is investigated to make certain that the immigrant is a bona fßde farmer, and the Canadian
farmer undertakes to provide him with employment and living accommodation for a
minimum period of one year.
In carrying out this movement the department has had the co-operation of a number
of federal and provincial departments, and of
various organizations and agencies, such as
the colonization departments of the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian
National Railways, the Christian Reformed
Church, the Catholic Immigrant Aid Society,
the United Church of Canada and others. It is
the function of the Immigration Branch to
supervise and co-ordinate the activities of all
organizations interested in the settlement of

SENATE
immigrants. The movement of these Netherlands agriculturists is working out very satisfactorily. Some 3,000 came during 1947; 7,000
during 1948; and 6,000 in 1949.
The general progress of these Dutch agricultural immigrants since their arrival in
Canada bas been good. With very few exceptions they have rapidly fitted into Canadian
ways and farming methods. They have proved
to be very industrious. One thing that is
characteristic of them above all others is
that their main objective in coming to Canada
is to establish themselves on farms of their
own as soon as possible. The family units are
closely knit and work together, saving their
money for the purchase of a farm, or for
acquiring livestock and working equipment
for use on rented land. Already over 600 of
these Netherlands families have made a start
in farming in Canada.
In recognition of the outstanding service
rendered by the people of Malta during the
war, and in order to assist Malta with its
present employment problem, special provision was made for the admission to Canada
of a number of Maltese who ordinarily would
not come within the admissible classes. Some
500 of these people came forward during 1948
and were placed in employment by the
Department of Labour, and provision bas
been made for the entry of an additional 300
who, it is expected, will come forward during
1950.
In order to give practical expression to the
policy of developing a well-balanced economy
in Canada through the careful selection of
suitable immigrants, the Settlement Service
Division of the Immigration Branch has been
re-instituted. It is the responsibility of the
Immigration Branch through this division to
discover needs and develop opportunities for
immigrants to Canada; to locate and select
suitable immigrants overseas; and to assist
immigrants in becoming permanently established in this country. The particular fields
of activity of the Immigration Branch in this
work are in agriculture and in the establishment of small businesses in rural communities.
Unfortunately there is still a tremendous
body of people in Europe who have been
driven from their homes and countries of
origin, and who eagerly await the opportunity
to rebuild their lives in another land.
The story of the operations carried out by
the International Refugee Organization is
remarkable, for in two and a half years there
has been a greater movement of peoples than
has ever taken place at any time except
during war. This movement has been on a
global scale, and bas involved the transfer
of hundreds of thousands of men, women and
children.

At Lake Success last autumn ve were
obliged to listen to repeated assertions by
representatives of the Soviet Republics and
of countries dominated by the Soviet that the
International Refugee Organization was kept
alive solely for the benefit of the United
States, the United Kin'gdom, France and a
few other countries, and that this problem
could be easily resolved if only we would send
back these refugees to their countries of
origin. To have done this, we know, would
have been contrary to all the principles of
freedom of choice which we endorse. It
would have compelled these people to return
to conditions from which they had fled and
to be subject to policies with which they were
not in accord. It was therefore a great satisfaction to practically all the delegates at the
last assembly of the United Nations to know
that the International Refugee Organization,
which had been scheduled to pass out of
existence on June 30, 1950, would be continued until March 1, 1951. There were,
indeed, many thousands who needed the care
of this organization.
From July 1, 1947, to October 1, 1949 a
total of 284,523 refugees have been transported in International Refugee Organization
ships; 16,621 in IRO planes; and 320,660 by
other means, to countries of resettlement. In
October there remained 700,000 refugees for
whom the IRO is responsible. This number
has now been considerably reduced.
Canada, up to February, 1950, received
96,000 displaced persons . of whom 53,000
came to relatives, while others were selected
and brought to Canada under supervision of
a joint committee of the departments of
Immigration and Labour. Of these almost
10,000-9,985 to be exact,-came under the
domestic employment plan, 10,000 came to
work on farms, and 3,900 to work in our
mines. The record on the whole, has been
very satisfactory, and after enduring years of
wandering and hardships of all kinds, the
newcomers have adapted themselves readily
to conditions in a new country.
There remain under the care of IRO many
who, because of training and vocation, have
been left in Europe. Few countries are ready
to accept immigrants of the professional class
-doctors,
musicians,
artists,
engineers,
teachers, nurses and scientists-thus there are
many whose previous training seems to unsuit
them for placement in other lands. Again,
unfortunately, few ýcountries are looking for
immigrants who are over forty-five years of
some have too many children, and

others, when it means abandoning handicapped relatives, refuse to accept opportunities for their own resettlement.
I am sure we were all delighted and
impressed by the offer of Norway, a country

MARCH 15, 1950
which suffered heavily through the war, to
assume responsibility for half of the totally
blind, and their dependents, under the care
of IRO. Israel and France also have shown
great generosity in accepting the physically
handicapped.
I hesitate to enlarge further on the operations of the International Refugee Organization, but one question which came up for
consideration was what organization would
replace the IRO when it had to pass out of
existence. We were satisfied when it was
decided by a vote in the third committee a-t
Lake Success, and later in the plenary session,
that a High Commissioner for Refugees should
be appointed by the United Nations. He
would be responsible for and have authority
to deal with the legal status of refugees who
came under the limited provisions of the
IRO constitution. Other classes of refugees,
too, may be included later by -a vote of the
United Nations. The expenses of administration will be a charge on the budget of the
United Nations. The High Commissioner will
be empowered to handle moneys for maintenance or other care, which must be furnished by contributions from sympathetic
countries, organizations or individuals, and
he will be called upon to report to the Economic and Social COpuncil of the United Nations.
It was somewhat difficult for countries such
as Pakistan and India, who have numerous
problems of their own, to accept the responsibility of maintaining an office for a High
Commissioner whose sole duty is to deal with
European refugees; but they finally agreed to
do so.
* The problem is certainly not yet solved,
but we have seen a very satisfactory result
of a great humanitarian effort, an effort which
bas meant a new life to hundreds of
thousands.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I thank the honourable senator from Rockcliffe for having 'brought this question before
the Senate. In rising to speak on the resolution I intend to discuss only one angle of the
immigration question. I think everyone will
admit that the best "immigrants" are those
born to Canadian parents. I do not know if
family allowances are helping to increase the
number of such "immigrants", but perhaps
my good friend the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) will be able to inform me
on that point.
In my opinion the best type of people to
bring into this country are children of, let
us say, seven to fourteen years of age, from
any country whatever which shares our
ideology. By placing them in farmers' familles
or any other families willing to adopt children

we are likely to avoid the trouble and danger
of deportation proceedings, which sometimes
have to be taken against people who came
here as adults imbued with subversive ideas
and philosophies to which we are opposed.
In recommending the immigration of children I am speaking from experience. I have
observed-and no doubt the experience of all
honourable senators is similar-that when
young boys or girls from other lands are
placed in Canadian families they soon become
adapted to our way of life and grow up to be
good citizens, ready to fight, if necessary, for
their adopted country. In my own home and
neighbourhood I have seen many children
who, brought over from England, France,
Belgium and other countries by certain
organizations, within three or four years, or
five at the most, became helpful to the
families that adopted them and assets to this
country. I know a man who today occupies
a very important position in Montreal and
is one of our best citizens, but who was
brought into my district as an immigrant at
the age of eight.
If I may be allowed, I would suggest that
the Committee on Immigration study the
possibility of bringing in children between the
ages of seven and fourteen and, with the
assistance of the provincial governments, placing them in families. I have nothing to say
against the present policy of admitting adults
to this country, but I am sure that the bringing in of children would greatly benefit
Canada.
Hon. Mr.. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would like to speak on the
motion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then perhaps my bonourable friend will speak now.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I enter into this debate with a great deal of
diffidence. First I wish to pay my compliments to the senator fram Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson). There is no person in Canada
by whom this resolution could have been
better proposed to the Senate.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For two or more sessions
she has been Chairman of the Committee on
Immigration, of which I had the honour to be
a member, and she handled the committee's
work well, better than most men would have
done. .She knows the subject of immigration,
and has a very sympathetic heart towards it.
I am altogether in favour of the resolution,
but with the greatest respect, I do wish to
point out a few difficulties that occur to me.
Canada's area and resources are such that

SENATE
there is no possible limit to the size of our
population. I can see no reason for doubting
that in the years to come this country will
be able to support a population of two, three,
four or even five times the present population, and at the highest standard of living.
But when we admit immigrants the question
is whether we can assimilate them. There is
not likely to be much trouble in this respect
with people who come here intending to make
their living as farmers. In my province farm
immigrants, those who came there many years
ago as well as newcomers, have proved very
satisfactory.
Of course, I should like to see as large a
proportion as possible of our immigrants from
our two mother countries, Britain and France.
Those who come here from Britain will be
understood and welcomed by English-speaking Canadians, and immigrants from France
will be just as warmly received in Quebec
and other parts of the country where French
is spoken.
I hope my fears are not well founded, but
I am afraid that we are running into a period
of greater unemployment than we have had
in the past three or four years. This may be
the fault of the working people themselves,
but our responsibility in the matter is very
great.
Throughout the history of this dominion
the federal parliament has refused to accept
its full responsibility for dealing with
unemployment. True, it has made a forward
step in increasing the unemployment insurance benefits of many persons; but even
though that will give more money to the
unemployed, it is not an answer to the
problem. I wish I could share the optimism
of the Prime Minister; but I believe that while
some of the unemployment may be seasonal
much of it is not. I am deeply concerned
about the threat of unemployment in our large
cities, such as Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg
and Vancouver, and perhaps in even the
smaller cities.
One has only to read the press of this
country today to know what has happened in
Great Britain during the past month and a
half. Throughout the election campaign
everything was touched upon but the important issue of how that country was going to
produce goods and how it was going to sell
them-and that is a situation that we have to
face. I do not propose to say anything further on that, except that before we start
bringing in immigrants in large numbers we
should have a clear statement of policy from
the federal government.
If there is to be a period of unemployment
in this country, the dominion government
must undertake to relieve that condition. Our

municipalities are not able to meet any more
than a temporary lull in employment, and
the provinces, with their limited incomes,
cannot take care of long-term unemployment.
As to the rise in municipal costs, I need only
point to my own city of Winnipeg, where in
the past ten years the cost of education has
been more than doubled.
Hon. Mr. Leger: More than tripled.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am being conservative.
The entire burden is placed on the property
owners, who today are the people who pay
the taxes. If there are relief payments to be
made in a city, it is the property owners who
pay them through taxation.
I am all for proper immigration procedure.
I can still hear ringing in my ears the statements of the honourable member from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), who spoke in this
chamber some years ago about the difficulties
that confronted him when he started farming
in the West. But our problem today is what
to do with men and women in the cities who
become unemployed. I admit that I have not
got the answer.
I recall that during the last depression
period a man walked down Portage Avenue
in the city of Winnipeg, smashed a window
in Eaton's store and took out a loaf of bread.
That man had at home six or seven children
without food, and there were not enough
policemen in the city to arrest him. I was a
member of the legislature at the time, and
I said "I have children at home, and if they
were hungry I too would smash a window for
food". Some people said that I should be
thrown out of the legislature; but I remained,
notwithstanding my remark.
I am all for giving the people of Europe
who have been removed from their homes
and threatened with communism a chance for
a better life. I am even willing to give them
those opportunities in Canada. But that is
only the first step in a policy to settle this
country. I intend to vote for the resolution,
but I want to be sure that when the committee reports back to this house we will have
an announcement by the government as to
what it will do if, after we bring these
people here, there is no work for them and
they drift into the cities.
I am not a labour man, nor do I say that
men and women who work with their hands
and cannot get work are not sometimes to
blame, but I do not intend to stand idly by
and see people starve in this country. I
repeat that I will vote for the resolution, and
I will attend the committee meetings as
regularly as I can; but before the report is
received by this house we ought to have a
declaration as to federal government policy
on the question of unemployment.

have to face.

Strange as it may seem, what is happening

States and Russia. The old European world lies
on a bed of suffering and will never recover and
last.

And thus, out of the last war have come
these two nations, Uriited States and Russia.
How strong were they when war was declared
in 1939? As to the United States, her armed
forces and equipment were about on a par
with those of Poland. When Russia was
attacked by Hitler's German hordes, she had
to go to ber knees to save herself; she had
to ask help from the United States and Great
Britain to hait the German invasion. We
may have been wrong in giving Russia that
aid, because she has since become a more
dreaded menace and threat than our common
foe of that time. But facts are facts, and
Russia today is a real threat to the whole
civilized world.
I do not think figures have ever been published to show the total quantity of munitions,
guns, tanks, and general equipment sent by
the United States and Great Britain to
Murmansk in Russia. In giving this aid,
Great Britain deprived herself of equipment
which was vital to ber own defence, and let
us not forget the many lives and vessels that
were lost in delivering this equipment.
As to Russia's present exact strength, he
certainly would be a genius who could give
even an inkling of it. If there is a political
iron curtain-and what a splendid appellation
Winston Churchill gave it-there is an even
thicker iron curtain concealing the progress
of Russian armament.
May I digress for one moment? Everyone
here knows that during the war hundreds of
Sherman tanks were sent to Russia; but perhaps honourable senators have not read what
I did about the meeting of the American and
Russian armies after the fall of Berlin. A
great banquet was held that first night at
which twenty-one toasts were drunk, and the
following day a memorable parade took place.
An American officer was sitting next to a
Russian general, and after two or three
American infantry regiments had passed by,
some Sherman tanks came into view. The
Russian general turned to the American and
said, "I did not know you had our tanks in
your country". Whereupon the American
replied, "You did not know that we were
making them any more than I knew about
your two great generals, General Space and
General Winter".
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. David: I say with great respect

that the Russian peasants, who fought to safeguard their land, were not fighting for communism, the Kremlin or an ideology. They
were fighting for Mother Russia and Mother
Volga. History repeats itself. The sarn

thing happened in 1812 when Napoleon went
as far as Moscow only to find the city in
flames, and he was forced to retreat among
ruins. I am reminded how beautifully this
is expressed in that great musical composition of Tschaikovsky, the "1812" overture.
But even admitting that we know little of
Russia's strength today, we do know that she
rid herself of danger from the two nations
of which she was most afraid-on the west,
Germany; and, on the east, Japan.
We must also bear in mind that today she
dominates one-third of Europe and also a
great proportion of Asia. However, according to an article by Lord Robert Cecil, we
should not be too pessimistic about the future
of China. As I desire not to say anything
against the leader of the present Nationalist
movement, I suppose I should not quote certain other statements from that article.
Besides the territory which she dominates in
Europe and Asia, Russia has throughout the
world a fifth column, which is a great asset
to ber.
But what did Britain get in return for the
sacrifices she made during the last war? What
has she received for all the courage, valour
and bravery that she displayed in providing
the bulwark of civilization for more than
a year? Here are some of the results of the
war, for Britain. She lost her naval supremacy.
She lost the empire of India, whose 400 millions constitute nearly one-fifth of the total
population of the world. She lost ber foreign
investments. And she has ceased to be the
great financial country of the world. It is true
that, like a French king of the eleventh or
twelfth century, Britain can say, "All is lost
except my honour," but the country which at
one time stood alone in sustaining the whole
weight of the war now witnesses the downfall
of her past greatness.
It would be unwise for anyone to try to
prophesy what Europe's future will be, but
in considering future prospects one should
look at the Atlantic Pact, which I believe has
been in effect for about one year. It was
signed by a number of European and American countries, and perhaps for the time being
it might act as a deterrent to any nation
contemplating aggression against a signatory
of the pact.
But does it provide a guarantee for maintenance of peace in the future? In directing
attention to that question I ask for the
patience of honourable senators while I point
out one or two facts. The government of
every country that has signed the agreement
remains absolutely free, in case of conflict,
to determine what help it will offer to any
country that is attacked. Further, every such
onvernment is also free in the case of conflict

MARCH 15, 1950
to conclude that the aggression is not of a
kind that entails the obligation to provide
any help at all.
Yet there can be no doubt that the Atlantic
Pact has had a very salutary effect. When
James Monroe was President of the United
States, George Canning was Foreign Secretary
of Britain, and through emissaries, or directly,
Canning four times asked Monroe to make
a declaration-which he finally did makeand for more than a century that declaration
of what is known as. the Monroe Doctrine
remained the basic principle of United States
foreign policy. Now by signing the Atlantic
Pact the United States has abandoned the
principle of neutrality--of isolationism, if
you prefer-set out in the Monroe Doctrine.
Is that abandonment not tantamount to an
acknowledgment by the United States of the
necessary interdependence and co-ordination
of nations? Let us thank the Almighty for this
change in American foreign policy, for thereby
freedom throughout the world has gained
a powerful ally.
Should I speak of the failure of the League
of Nations? Should I say that notwithstanding the good faith, the endeavours and the
hard work of the majority of the nations, they
could not establish peace in the world? There
was then, as there is today, disunity among the
countries which created the League of Nations
and were parties to it. Nevertheless, there
was an effort put forth, and it is human that
we should sometimes consider more the effort
put forth than the goal attained. Certainly
there is proof that the ambition of a majority
of the nations has been to know peace,
tranquillity and stability.
The United Nations Organization has accomplished much since its inception; yet, apart
from one treaty of peace which it effected,
the others are waiting to be signed. Why?
It is because of disunity among the member
nations. Egoism will always exist; it cannot
be removed from nations any more than from
the individuals who compose them. When I
read the proceedings of the United Nations
I sometimes ask myself: Have we by this
organization furnished communistic Russia
with the safest possible forum for her propaganda?
I suppose it is useless for me to mention
the error made at the San Francisco conference when the right of veto was granted.
I condemn no one, because I think everyone
knows that the treaty of the alliance signed
at San Francisco never would have been
signed if the veto had not been assented to.
Yet, this is the cancer from which the United
Nations may die.
Sometimes one is inclined to think that
Stalin does not care very much about the
•

frictions which take place between what he
may call the enemy nations. I have before me
a statement which he made in answer to a
series of articles written by Chicherin, a former aristocrat, and at the time of writing,
Foreign Commissar. Stalin had this to say:
I consider that these articles of Chicherin, which
I have read carefully, are nothing but words.
Comrade Chicherin is inclined to deny the existence of friction between the imperialist states, to
exaggerate the international harmony of the
imperialists, and to overlook and underestimate
the internal friction within these groups. Yet
these frictions do exist. They lead to war. These
frictions should form the basis for the activities
of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

A little further on Stalin says:
The whole purpose of the People's Commissariat
of Foreign Affairs is to ascertain these frictions,
to make them the basis of its activities, and to
manoeuver within them.

Is it not possible that by means of a world
government-call it, if you like, a federal
union or an Atlantic union-we would have
more assurance and more power to counteract
the efforts of the Kremlin to crush our
civilization? I say very humbly that undoubtedly we would have more power. Why?
We have seen that under the Atlantic Pact
there is no obligation on the part of member
nations to fight, except when they believe
that aggression entails on their part an obligation to join in. Under a federal unionand I am not going into the details, because
there would have to be a convention and the
countries ready to join would work them out
-every
country agreeing to come into it
would be represented by a delegate, either
appointed or elected by that country. The
result would be that the delegate when speaking in the assembly of such a federal union
would engage the responsibility of the government which he represented. The majority
would be supreme. No veto could stop the
federal union assembly discussing any question or making decisions on any problems.
Do you not believe that these delegates, which
should not be great in number, would exercise
a tremendous influence and carry a weight
which those who represent the nations in the
Atlantic Pact do not carry?
But I am not without a suspicion-indeed,
nor without the knowledge-that many
obstacles will have to be overcome before so
lofty a goal can be attained. It is evident that
we shall have to take into consideration the
egoism of nations, their desira to dominate,
and their reluctance to yield even the smallest
part of their sovereignty. And such a concession would be necessary. A federal union
government, if it is to possess any importance
or have any influence, would require, first, the
power to conduct foreign relations, to declare
peace and war, to raise and maintain an armed
force. Next, it must have the right to coin

At this point, if I may be allowed a citation,
I should like to quote the words of William
L. Clayton, former Under-Secretary of State
for the United States, who, speaking before
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
May 1949, said:
Billions of private capital and the creative genius
and activity of lis owners remain in hiding because
of the danger of war and the fear of the integrity
of certain European currencies . . . Governments
have thus been compelled to undertake the greater
part of the job of recovery . . . Private enterprise
will operate freely in Europe only when there is
peace and confidence in currencies ...
Total costs to the democracies are taxing their
economies excessively. In our own case-

He is speaking of the United States.
-the burden may get too heavy, even for our own
strong back. But we dare not lay it down.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. David:

Abandonment

of certain

elements of sovereignty, abandonment of
direction of foreign affairs, abandonment of

th? right to regulate interstate trade-certainly, these would be a very great sacrifice to
ask of nations: may I say, a tremendous sacrifice on the part of Canada. But do you not
believe that it is better at times to sacrifice a
little of our pride, a little of our liberty, a
little of our sovereignty, than one day to lose,
not a part, but the whole, of our freedom and
all our liberty?
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. David: This idea of a world government was not born yesterday. If my memory serves me-and there are here university

prof essors who can correct me if I am wrongas long ago as Charles the Fifth of Spain,
Holland, Italy, part of France, and Germany,
the idea of a world government existed. Later
on, Louis the Fourteenth had in his mind the
establishment of a world government. From
1919 to 1922 or 1923 Aristide Briand was the
apostle of such an idea. Winston Churchill,
in his famous speech at Fulton, although he
did not go so far as to propose federal union,
pleaded for the union of all English-speaking
peoples-and this, if I may say so, as a bait
to get other nations into the federation.

merge into one as regards certain common interests
but remain separated and merely confederated in
all other regards . . . Clearly this is no longer a
federal government, but an incomplete national
government.
Thus men found a form of government that was
not precisely either national or federal; but there
they stopped, and the new word that should
express this new thing does not yet exist.

Since the beginning of 1948 a word-or perhaps it would be better to say a term-to
express this new thing has come into existence.
It is either Atlantic union, world government
or world federation.
John Foster Dulles, in an address before the
American Political Science Association, said:
Towards the beginning of World War II, Mr.
Clement Attlee exclaimed, "Europe must federate or
perish."

He was right.

Then he went on to say:

But independent states are socialized to such
a degree that they dare not voluntarily expose
their economies to new external influences that
would upset present governmental planning.
Take England. There the government is trying
out many measures of socialization. That experiment requires building a wall around England
which can be penetrated only as planned by the
English government. English economy cannot face
the impact of external forces or natural competition. We have the strange result that the Attlee
government is a major obstacle to that federation
of Europe which Mr. Attlee recognized was imperative if Europe were not to perish.

Mr. Livingstone Hartley, head of the Washington Union Committee, after mentioning the
Atlantic Pact, declared:
In the first place, the union would be far stronger
It would have one foreign

some progress will be made toward all these ends.
In the union, they would be completely achieved
and a comparable effort would consequently bring
far greater defence power.
In the second place, union could avert a number
of potential dangers to the future success of the

might result in communist domination of the
governments of some of our European allies. This
would be impossible in the union, in which communists would be at most a feeble minority.

Ambassador Warren R. Austin, chief of the
United States Mission to the United Nations,
had this to say:
All of us today need the near look and the far
vision in world affairs. With the near look we

MARCH 15, 1950
must perceive and avold the hazards we face here
and now: that is through the United Nations. With
the far vision we must look far ahead to our final
goal of world peace under law: that introduces
world federation.
I do flot believe that changes in thought or policy
are quick or radical. I do believe they are graduai
and continuous. So 1 feel sure that it will take
a long trne to prepare peoples and goverfiments
of most nations for acceptance of and participation
in a world government. Simply for same people
to declare that it is necesaary now or we perish,
does flot make the radical changes required any
more feasible. If we expect this future world
government to be created by agreement and not
by force or conquest, we will have ta be willing
to work patiently until peoples and gavernments
are ready for it.

Honourabie senators, despite ail we read
and ail we see, let us flot be pessimistic.

Pessimism is very often, if not generally, an
excuse for refusing to face difficulties. Courage
and audacity will deter us fromn believing
that no success can be achieved or that it is
not worth whiie to try.
Borne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. David: There is such a thing as
being an idealist without delusions, and being'
a reaiist without despair. I arn sarry that
I arn unabie to recail the name of the author
of these wards.
Therefore, honourabie senators, in this
endeavour let us walk, flot run, towards the
goal; but let us remember that every step
must be forward. This means that much
seriaus thinking must take place before we
start on our march in a world in which the
llghts are dirn and the very stars themselves
are wandering. Let each person who is reaily
desirous of doing his share in this tremendous

undertaking start now by asking our Canadian
schools to teach more of love and less ai hate.
Let us destroy what is left of our xenophobia.
Let our schools teach what we owe ta our
wonderiul scientists, inventors and philosophers, our artists, writers, musicians, painters and sculptors,-iet them teach more of the
beauty of peace and a littie less of the glory
of war.
Borne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. David: Then our national heroes
wiii not only be those who have been victorlous on the battlefield but those who have
made life worthwhile.
Honourable senators, I do not believe I
could terminate in a more fitting way than by
reciting a prayer that was uttered 700 years
ago by Saint Francis of Assisi, and which is
as practical today as it evidently was when
he composed it. This is the prayer:
Lord,

make me an

Thy peace.

Where there la hatred, let me sow love. Where
there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt,

THE ESTIMATES
REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT
AND COMMUNICATIONS
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved:
That the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications be authorized to examine the expenditures proposed by the following votes of the
estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1951, in advance of the bills based
on the said estimates reaching the Senate, namely:
Votes 269 to 274 inclusive,
Votes 459 to 527 inclusive,
Votes 557 to 561 inclusive,
And that the said committee be empowered to send
for persons, papers and records.
He said: Honourable senators, what I have

to say in asking the house to consider this
motion-and it will be very brief-is applicable to the entire series of motions which
follow.

I suggest that this house take advantage
of the early tabling of the estimates in the
other place, by referring them to the various
standing committees of the Senate, so that
they may be studied and inquired into prior

to the arrival of the supply bill based upon
them.

It

is entirely

appropriate

that we

should do so, since the Senate of Canada has
undoubtedly the constitutional power to
inquire into bills originating in the Commons
which appropriate any part of the revenue
or impose a tax, and, if it sees fit, to amend
them by reducing the amounts therein mentioned. At the same time it has been generally
recognized that the Senate has not the right
to increase appropriations.

Honourable senators have not only the
right but, I believe, the responsibility of
inquiring into expenditures proposed by the
estimates presented to parliament. It will be
recalled that at various times in the past we

have attempted to do this, but our efforts in
this respect have been handicapped by the
fact that ordinarily the estimates are not
presented to parliament until after the conclusion of the debate on the Address, and that
often this coincided with a flow of legislation
which had to be dealt with and thus restric-

ted the time available.
The early publication of the estimates this
year facilitates action on our part, and I
believe we should take advantage of it.

I

go further: I believe that if we could organize so that in the future we can conduct a
searching and constructively critical examina-

tion of public expenditures, we might thereby
render a very useful public service.
The spirit of our approach to this question
should, I believe, closely parallel our constitutional powers, in that we should look for
possible reductions in governmental expenditures rather than proposed increases. It may
well be that in the future, and even today,
increases of the sums contemplated would
seem to be in the public interest; but I think
we should be quite content to leave to others
the opportunity of advocating increased
expenditures while we concentrate on the
problem of how they may be reduced without prejudice to the public interest. I need
hardly say that this course is not likely to
be popular, since there has developed, particularly in recent years, a situation in which
almost every organization or group in Canada
while paying lip service to governmental
economy in the abstract has been pressing
from all angles for ever-increasing government expenditures.
The first problem to be faced is how we
can most effectively undertake our examination of proposed governmental expenditures;
and this should be the first question to which
the various committees should address themselves. It is a very big problem, and to
begin with we may be able only to make an
approach towards dealing effectively with it.
My own personal opinion is that we should
not attempt too much, and that the quality
of what we do should count more than the
quantity.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
am not going to object to this motion. As a
matter of fact, His Honour the Speaker will
recall that during the war years, when he was
leader of the other side of the house, this
practice was adopted quite often. I hope,
however, that if it is again adopted it will
not mean that we will rush the various items
through in rapid order. That procedure would
get us nowhere.
. I believe there is a strong feeling across this
country that many sides of the operation of
the CBC should be looked into. It cannot be
contradicted that the CBC is a form of communication that enters right into the family
circle. Let me illustrate. I doubt whether
any honourable senator listens to the radio
more than I do when I am at home. I follow
particularly the Sunday radio programs, commencing with the news broadcast at one
o'clock in the afternoon. First I listen to the
American viewpoint, which lasts for ten
minutes. This is followed by a ten-minute
British newscast, and then a Canadian commentator concludes the half-hour broadcast.
I have no objection to the speakers who give
the American and Canadian viewpoints,

MARCH 16, 1950
because generally they are members of our
Canadiari press and represent different shades
of politics. I do, however, object violently to
the British CBC report. I do not know what
Mathew Halton calls himself, but for the
last four years he has been absolutely biased
in favour of the British Labour party. In
order to clear himself before the recent British
election he stated, "I think, of course, that the
Conservatives will win, but . . ." and then he
went on to give his best dissertation on the
merits of the Labour party. Once in a while
the editor of the Manchester Guardian, -or
some other prominent British newspaperman,
is allowed to go on the air, and then we get a
general view of British politics. But I do not
feel that Canada should pay for the usual
kind of British news broadcast that comes over
the CBC.
. Another CBC program is "The Forum". I
have always noticed that on this program anything touching on politics is dealt with very
strongly by a C.C.F'er and in lukewarm
fashion by a free enterpriser, and that the
umpire sides with the C.C.F.'er every time he
gets the chance. If it is desirable that political
propaganda should go out over the radio, there
is a simple method to be adppted. Count up
the total number of votes gained at the last
federal election by the Liberals, the Progressive Conservatives, the C.C.F'ers and the
Labour Progressives, or the Communist party,
if you want to cal it that-and then apportion their relative times on the air. In this
way there could be no dispute, and each party
would be dealt with fairly.
Then they have a weekly review on Sunday
evenings, which we used to get at half past
five, central time, but which I think now
comes at half past eight. A great many of the
people who speak on these programs are
CCFers. One is a professor down at McGill
University, a man whom I know. He used to be
in our province and he is utterly pro-CCF.
There is no doubt about that at all. Now, a
man has a right to be a CCFer if he wants to;
that is his own business. It is none of my
business whether a person is a Liberal, a Conservative or CCFer, but I do not think we
should pay for putting the propaganda of one
party out over the air in Canada unless we
allow representatives of other parties broadcasting time proportionate to their numerical
strength. But the CBC does not make this
fair distribution of time. I am not at the
moment saying anything about the licence fee
-whether it should be $2.50 or $3.00 or $4.00
or nothing at all; that is probably a business
question, and although I may have my own
views on it I am not expressing them just
now.
We in the West are very dependent on the
CBC, for there are not many other broadcast-

ing services that reach us. True, we can get
some of the American stations. There is one
across the line from Winnipeg which we hear,
and we are within range of one across the
line from Saskatchewan and Alberta. But by
and large we are largely dependent upon our
national radio service. Now, I should like to
ask the radio commission why it has this
broadcasting policy that I have referred to,
and who is responsible for it. I think I am
entitled to ask that. I wish to make it clear
that I am not against the CBC. To speak quite
candidly, I feel sure that my wife and I
listen more to CBC programs than to all other
programs put together. So I am not prejudiced against the CBC. Some of its programs
are very fine indeed. I have not a musical ear,
and so am no judge of the musical talent on
the programs, but those who know about such
things tell me that many of the musical
programs are very good.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Do they put you to sleep?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, they do not put me to
sleep, I will say that.
The second point that I wish to make is
this. I do not believe it is possible to devise
any satisfactory system whereby one company
in business can exercise control over its
competitors. The Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation say that in their own ininds
they can separate the interests of the CBC,
from those of independent stations and judge
the independent stations fairly. I do not
believe it is humanly possible to do that. It
certainly is not possible in any other field of
endeavour, and we never allow such a thing
to be done in any other field. For instance, a
man appointed to the bench is required to
give up his law practice and to sever his business connections. He receives a salary from
the federal treasury, and so can maintain an
independent mind when giving judgment.
But by its very nature the CBC is bound to
be unfair to independent stations. The men
who make up the corporation, being human,
cannot help it. I am only human, and I know
that if I were on the corporation I could not
be fair to independent stations, nor do I
believe any other member of this chamber
could. You place a person in a very awkward
position when you require him to give a judgment which may be contrary to his own
interests.
I should like to have the CBC called before
our committee. The other house has had a
radio committee for years, but the members
of that house are bound to be affected by
political reaction to some questions. We are
told that the CBC is not controlled by the government. I do not say it is. What I object

SENATE

to is the lack of control, which results in failure to permit expressions of opinion representative of every element in the community.
I may be told that there is no such thing
as CCF influence in the CBC. but it is there.
I can understand men or women who believe
in the CCF and who get an opportunity to
speak over the CBC tinging their remarks
according to their own political views. Well,
if you let enough of such people continue to
broadcast without opposition, in time they will
put their views over. I do not want the CBC
representatives to be the last people heard
by our committee; I want them to be the
first, so that we can bring out these things.
I should also like to ask sone questions
of other departments. For instance, I should
like the Department of Trade and Commerce
to tell us something about our trade commissions, about Canada's trade agreements
and ber future prospects for trade. I should
like to see men like the Deputy Minister of
Trade and Commerce, who is a most able
person, appear before this committee. We
may not agree entirely with what he may
have to say about trade, but we will at least
know that he is approaching the subject
wholeheartedly and with the right attitude.
My reason for offering these suggestions
is that I do not think anything can be gained
by our going over the estimates item by item,
as is done in the House of Commons and in
provincial legislatures. We should investigate the basic principles underlying the estimates. I agree with the proposal of the
honourable leader of the government, and
I think he is to be congratulated on his
action. We will at least have an opportunity
to suggest to the members of the House of
Commons reductions in government spending.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the motion passes I trust it is in
order for me to make a few remarks.
In looking over the allocations of the
various estimates to committees, I note that
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is
allotted to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. I am not now a
member of that committee, but I hope I may
be appointed to it. What I have to say about
the CBC is not new. I was a member of the
radio committee of the House of Commons,
and what surprised me was that many members of that house seemed determined to
uphold whatever was done by the CBC, right
or wrong. Some honourable senators may
have been members of the House of Commons, as I was, when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was set up by the late
Right Honourable R. B. Bennett, and they
will kr >w that the idea was not universally

approved. Nevertheless, once the organization was established the members championed
it.
I wonder how many honourable senators
know that it is not possible to find out what
salaries are paid to the higher officials of the
CBC. The members in the other place tried
unsuccessfully to get this information. The
CBC is a body which sets itself away above
the people and their representatives and
parliament, and it spends money as it sees
fit. There are many questions I should like
to put to the officials of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about information which
we should have. The firm in Toronto that
takes polls of radio listeners-if one can place
reliance on its reports-has given CBC stations
the lowest rating amongst all radio stations
in Canada. If the public is the judge of the
quality of radio programmes, as it should be,
why is it that the CBC is rated so low?
It is well known that when the proceedings
of international meetings are broadcast the
CBC is not concerned about wave-lengths,
'but with the securing of lines for themselves;
and from one end of Canada to the other little
stations are being jammed by the CBC.
Also, I am concerned about the spending
of this corporation.
I trust that the honourable leader of the
government will take note of my request to be
appointed to the committee on Transportation and Communication. My approach to
the subject of radio is not in any way destructive, but I do think the Senate can do good
work on behalf of the people of Canada by
inquiring into the affairs of the CBC. It is a
well known fact that the cabinet ministers are
far too busy to attend to the details of the
estimates and the other house has failed to
properly control expenditures. I believe that
if the Senate does nothing else but make
recommendations for economies, it will be
doing a worth while job for the people of
Canada.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I do not wish to prolong unduly the
discussion on this subject. From what has
been said it is quite evident that there is
justification for the appointment of these
committees to investigate the estimates.
I am rising to reply to some remarks made
by the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) with reference, particularly, to Mr.
Halton, the CBC correspondent in Great
Britain. I happen to know Mr. Halton, and
I listen attentively to his broadcasts whenever
I can. For instance, I know that when a
causerie of correspondents from different

MARCH 16, 1950
parts of the world were making their forecasts last New Year's Day Mr. Halton, speaking fromn London, very definitely forecast the
defeat of the Labour government in England.
Later I listened to his broadcasts during the
election campaign because 1 know that among
people who have had to do with reporting
news he is considered to, be a most competent
and objective reporter.
I do flot think the broadcasts Mr. Halton
made during the campaign in England were
inordinately coloured by prejudice, and 1 feel
that something should be said on his behaif.
He is a very good servant of Canada, and had
extensive newspaper experience before he
went to England. I believe that if a census
were taken of opinion across this country it
'would show that Mr. Halton is regarded as a
most competent reporter.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I appreciate the desire of
the honourable senator fromn New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) to be on the Committee on Transport and Communications. I
may say that some fiteen years ago ýthis house
established a procedure whereby any senator
may now attend the meetings of any committee he chooses, and may ask any questions
he wishes. But when a division occurs he
may not cast a vote.
I have in mind an occasion w-hen the late
Right Honourable Senator Dandurand was
leader of the government, and the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen was sitting in the
seat which I now occupy as leader of the
opposition. I was a new member in this
house and was accustomed ta being quite
active. When I attended a certain committee
somne honourable senator asked whether I was
a member of that committee. As I was not,
I immediately left the room, but when the
report of that committee was being considered
in the house I raised a question as to whether
or not; I should be permitted to attend. The
house then unanimnously decided to permit
any senator to attend the meetings of any
committee and participate in its discussions;
but not to vote on any divisions which might
have occurred.
Hon. Mr. Ross: May he move or second a
motion?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. That wauld be tantamaunt ta voting.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I would
much rather be a member af the committee
than merely sit in an Its proceedings. If I
asked too many questions somnebody might
abject that I was not a member.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Nobody would do that.
The motion was agreed ta.

Hon. Mr. Vien: With regard to this last
motion, I would suggest to the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robcrtson) that
instead of referring to the Standing Committee on Finance only certain votes contained

in the estimates submitted to parliament, all
estimates submitted to parliament be referred
to that committee. As the honourable
leader mentioned, there are certain sections
of the estimates which have not been referred to any committee; and I do not know why
a standing committee of the Senate should
not have the opportunity to examine all of
them. I wholly approve of the dispostion
that has been made of the estimates through
the previous motions, because each standing
committee will be called upon to examine the
things with which it is particularly .concerned.
But with respect to the Committee on Finance,
instead of limiting its operations to a few
items, all estimates, in my opinion should be
referred to it so that it may examine the
whole subject of the estimates which have
been brought before parliament this year.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Does my honourable
friend mean that he would have all the
estimates referred to the Finance Committee,
or only those which have not been referred
to other committees?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I suggest that all the estimates should be referred to the Committee
on Finance, in order that that committee shall
not be fettered by any restrictions. I believe
that the purpose for which these resolutions
are presented to the Senate would be better
served if, notwithstanding particular duties
imposed upon the respective committees, the
Committee on Finance were empowered to
examine all the estimates.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That would be a duplication, would it nat?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The honourable senator has raised a point well worth our consideration, but I would not be prepared to agree
with it until I had given a little thought to
the obligations which might arise were the
same estimates referred to two different
committees. I can see an excellent argument
for referring to the Finance Committee votes
which have not been specifically assigned to
other committees. Even there, however, some
difficulties can be foreseen. For instance, the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources
deals with primary industries-agriculture,
mining, and forestry-and some of the votes
relating to forestry originate in different
departments from some of the agricultural
items, and it would simplify matters to leave
them where they are. However, as I said, I
will take cognizance of the point my honourable friend has raised. For the moment, in
order to get started, we might move in
accordance with the proposed procedure,
though it may be necessary-it is a matter to
which honourable 'senators also might give
consideration-to change some of these
references from one committee to another.

MARCH 16, 1950
After all, we are undertaking a more detailed
examination than has ever been attempted
before, so it might be well to allow my
honourable friend's specific suggestion to
stand until I have had an opportunity to
consider it.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I do not want to delay the
passing of the resolution. This is an experiment, a departure from our ordinary practice.
I approve entirely the procedure; and, in order
that the passing of the resolution may not be
delayed, I would be quite willing to agree
that all other items of estimates that have not
been specifically mentioned be referred to the
Committee on Finance.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That would be all right.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I would .be satisfied if that
were done. I appreciate that there might be
some confusion- if the same estimates were
referred to two standing committees; for that
reason I would be satisfied if the motion numbered 10 were amended to the effect that all
other estimates be referred to that committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honoftrable senators, some
little time ago the leader of the government
asked me to take the chairmanship of the
Finance Committee in succession to the late
Hon. Mr. Sinclair; and-presumably because I
have assumed this new responsibility, the
leader of the government has been good
enough to discuss with me this matter of the
allocation of the estimates. I quite understand the point raised by my honourable
friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien). In
effect, if his suggestion were carried out, the
Finance Committee would be the committee
to deal with estimates: it would be a sort of
senate committee on estimates. Perhaps there
is something to be said for that, although I
think the procedure that we are now considering may be better.
Let me say at once that this whole thing is
in the nature of an exploratory process. There
is a general feeling that a vast number of
items which appear in the blue book of
estimates sometimes receive scant consideration. That is particularly the case when
towards'the end of the session, as often happens, huge sums are voted in what I shall
call the other place, with rather startling
rapidity; and that has raised the complaint
that parliament, of which this house is a
branch, is not giving sufficient consideration to
the expenditure of the taxpayers' money.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? I have often
heard the suggestion he has just mentioned,
and I can never understand it. When I was
in the other place every item that was passed
there was discussed for days and weeks. It
is true that items were passed very quickly at

the end of the session, but it is not right to
say that they were passed without consideration.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan)
is of course entitled to his opinion. I am not
casting a reflection on any government. I am
simply stating a criticism that has been made
in the press and elsewhere.
But let me return to where I was when my
honourable friend interrupted me. It has
been proposed to divide the work up, and it
is obvious that in the allocation which the
leader of the government has submitted to
the house, an effort bas been made to refer
the items of the different departments to the
appropriate committees. For instance, agriculture, which is one of the great wealthproducing industries of this country, has been
submitted to the Committee on Natural
Resources. It is going to be an interesting
experience to hear the evidence of the various
departmental officials, and to inquire of them:
"You have a vote here of so much. Is that
necessary? Just what do you do with that
money? Could it be reduced?" These are all
functions of parliament, and what we are
endeavouring to do here is to carry out, in
effect, what has been done for many years in
the British parliament where estimates are
submitted to a committee on estimates. The
British parliament followed, very largely, the
procedure suggested by the honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien); but
here we have a new departure.
I hope that the committees responsible for
dealing with the various items will discharge
their duties in such a way that it will not only
bring public commendation but supply useful
information on the vast machinery of government which we have in this country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would suggest to the bonourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien) that be allow the motion to go
through as it is, with. the understanding that
if some item -comes up that is not covered, the
leader of the government will consent to a
special motion to refer the item.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am quite agreeable to that.
The motion was agreed to.
REGULATIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill Hi an Act to provide for the
publication of Statutory Regulations.
He said: -Honourable senators, this is a biH
of some interest and public importance. It is
entitled "An Act to provide for the publication of Statutory Regulations", but it 1s

SENATE
known, for short, as the "Regulations Act".
If I were inclined to indulge in simile, I
would say that this is a bill to build a legislative beacon to throw light upon executive
darkness.
One of the principal characteristics of
modern legislation is what we know as the
delegation of powers. Constantly, in these
days, in bills that come before us, we find
clauses which confer upon somebody-the
Governor in Council, a minister, or some
governmental body-the power to make regulations which will have the force and effect
of law, and which will be binding upon the
public, regardless of the fact that the regulations are not contained in the legislation
itself. In these cases, the question immediately arises: How are such regulations or
orders, when they have been enacted, to be
given proper publicity, so that the public
may know by what laws it is bound? There
is no question in the case of statutes, because,
being public property, they are published
from time to time and are open to everyone.
On the other hand, there is no general provision in our law at the present time whereby
an order in council having legislative effect,
and being binding upon the people of this
country, shall be published in such a way
that the whole of the public may know
about it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It appears in the Canada
Gazette, does it not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In much of the legislation passed by this parliament in the last
few years, parliament has been most careful
to provide that any order in council authorized by the legislation in question shall be
published in such and such a way.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And within a certain time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, and within a certain time. This bill is designed to provide a
statutory obligation, both to publish in the
Canada Gazette and to table in parliament,
every regulation or order having legislative
effect, and which has been issued under
powers delegated by legislation such as I
have described.
I may say that at the beginning of the war
this question came up very actively in connection with a large number of orders in
council that were to be issued under the War
Measures Act, and orders in council were
issued at the commencement of and during
the course of the war, providing for the publication of such of those orders as were of
public interest and as they affected the public
generally. Those orders in council were
finally generalized in a new order in council,
passed at the end of 1946, which provided,
more or less in the same terms as this legislation, what it is now sought to provide.

Therefore, the terms of the bill now before
us really put into statutory form, in the light
of the experience gained in the operation of
the order in council of 1946 over the last
three years, the provisions of that order in
council.
There has been at times, and I would not
say without some justification, a criticism of
what is called "government by order in
council". I have before me a table which I
think might interest honourable members.
It gives the total number of orders in council,
exclusive of Treasury Board minutes, passed
in each of the years 1935 to 1949. With the
permission of the house I will read the
figures, to the nearest hundred.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Why not place them on the
record?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I will accept my honourable friend's suggestion and place them
on the record. I might say that in the first
year shown, 1935, the number was 4,000, and
during the war years there was a considerable increase-for instance, in 1942 the number was 11,800. By 1949, though, it was
down to 6,600.
(The table referred to above appears
herewith.)
The following are the total numbers, to the nearest
hundred, of orders in council (exclusive of Treasury
Board minutes) passed each year from 1935-1949:
4,000
1935 .......................................
3,300

5,400
1947 ...... ................................
6,100
.......................................
1948
6,600
1949 .....................................

I want to stress this point. The vast
majority of these orders in council do not
deal with legislative matters at all, but purely
with administrative matters, and therefore do
not fall within the purview of this legislation.
They deal with the awarding of contracts,
leases of crown lands, and things of that kind.
It is estimated that of the total number of
orders in council passed in any one year
approximately only 5 to 6 per cent are of a
legislative character and will be governed
by this bill.
Now if the house will let me turn to the
terms of the bill itselfHon. Mr. Farris: Who determines whether
they are legislative or purely administrative?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I was coming to that.
I suppose one of the most important features

MARCH 16, 1950

of the bill is its definition of a regulation
falling within its terms. Section 2 defines a
regulation which is to be subject to this system
of publication and so-forth as:
A rule, order, regulation, by-law or proclamation
(i) made, in the exercise of a legislative power
conferred by or under an act of parliament, by the
Governor in Council, the Treasury Board, a minister
of the Crown, or a board, commission, corporation
or other body or person that is an agent or servant
of His Majesty in right of Canada, or
(i) for the contravention of which a penalty of
fine or imprisonment is prescribed by or under an
act of parliament.

I am informed that in the view of the
Department of Justice those words "made, in
the exercise of a legislative power" confine
the category of regulations covered by this
legislation to rules, orders, etc., of a legislative
character and exclude those of a purely
administrative character.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In each case who makes
the decision as to which it is?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, I suppose if a
question arose as to whether or not an order
in council or regulation was legislative, it
would have to be submitted to the courts. It
would be very important to have such a
question decided, because if some department considered an order in council not to
fall within this category and the courts
decided that it did, it would be completely
inoperative as against the public.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is to say, no such
order in council would be operative unless
it was published as provided in this bill?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Precisely.
Apart from the definition to which I referred, the main features of the bill are these.
First of all, it provides for compulsory publication in the Canada Gazette of all these
statutory orders and regulations within thirty
days after' they are made. Then it provides
for their compulsory tabling in parliament
within fifteen days after they are published
or, if parliament is not then in session, within
fifteen days after the commencement of the
next session. Then it provides that no regulation shal be invalid by reason only of nonpublication, but no conviction can be secured
for any offence in contravention of a regulation that has not been published. Then it
provides, in effect, that in the various Acts
which have been passed from time to time
the provisions as to publication of regulations
-which provisions vary a great deal-shall
be superseded by the general provision in this
bill.
In the schedule to the bill honourable senators will see a list of not less than 111 Acts
of parliament which in one section or another
provide for publication of regulations or
55950-7

orders in council. All these provisions will be
repealed by this bill and replaced by general
provision in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Does the repeal extend
only to the requirement for publication in the
Canada Gazette, so that there will not be a
duplication of this requirement?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: For the various methods
of publication provided in these 111 statutes
this bill substitutes one method of publication.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Is it intended to make the
other statutes conform to this one?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The bill does not even
do that. It wipes out of these other statutes
the provisions dealing with publication and
substitutes the provision in this statute.
I do not think there is anything more that
I neëd say to the house at this stage. Should
the bill obtain second reading I would suggest
that it be sent to an appropriate committee,
which I think might be the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: May I ask the
Deputy Leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) if he
thinks it would be possible to send these
different legislative regulations to judges,
magistrates and lawyers? In many cases at
present it is absolutely impossible for those
administering the law to obtain copies of
regulations. Judges are furnished with copies
of the statutes, and if these regulations are
to be regarded as law, should not copies of
them also be distributed as I have suggested,
in addition to being published in the Canada
Gazette? I may say that in my opinion this
bill proposes a real improvement over present
conditions, and it seems to me that the government should follow up the improvement by
having copies of the legislative regulations
sent out to judges, magistrates and lawyers,
at least. The only expense involved would
be for the printing and distribution of a few
thousand copies of each regulation, and I
think the moneys so used would be put to a
good purpose.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable
friend's suggestion is a very valuable one.
It is a matter about which we can inquire
from departmental officials in committee. They
may already be sending out copies of regulations, or arranging to have this done; but if
not, I am quite sure they will welcome the
suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Dennis: Speaking of publication,
may I ask the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) if he and honourable senators on both sides of the house are
satisfied with the newspaper coverage of this
honourable body?
Hon. Arthur W. Eoebuck: Honourable
senators, may I say that it is just about time

SENATE

that the authorities introduced a bill of this
nature to bring about some uniform system
of publishing governmental regulatiçns.
When I took office in the government of the
province of Ontario I found that there were
regulations scattered throughout the various
departments, and no one seemed to know
where they were to be found. In an effort
to bring some order out of chaos, I had an
official undertake to compile a book containing
all departmental orders. After working on
the job for more than a year lie reported to
me that such a task was impossible. He
pointed out that some of the departments
themselves were not familiar with orders
which affected them, and that no department
had complete knowledge of the regulations
to which it was subject. The matter was
dropped and, so far as I know, no such
book has ever been published in the province
of Ontario.
Conditions in this respect were bad enough
in Ontario, but in Ottawa they are much
worse. I had a splendid illustration of this
recently when I took part in an action in
which the Post Office Department sought to
make a postmaster responsible for the dishonesty of a member of his staff. The authority pleaded was found in a publication of the
post office entitled "Useful Information for
Postmasters". It contained a casual statement to the effect that postmasters would be
held responsible for the dishonesty of their
employees. It was not the usual common law
responsibility of a employer for the action of
his employee, but rather it created some
special extra-mural responsibility. This book
was said to have been published under the
authority of the Postmaster General-it was
not even called "Regulations", much less
"Orders in Council"-but on the strength of
that book the department tried to attach
responsibility to one of its postmasters. The
case was pleaded, and judgment was reserved.
I am sure that his lordship is now struggling
seriously and intelligently with this problem.
My criticism of the bill before us is that it
does not go far enough. In effect, it says that
no regulation shall be valid against an
accused person unless it has been filed in a
specific way. So far as it goes that is all
right, but regulations may change the civil
rights of individuals, as happened in the
illustration to which I have referred, in which
a chance piece of literature was laid before
a judge as being valid in a charge against the
individual.
I do not know why the government chose
to stop where it did in preparing this bill. It
may be desirable to start the system in this
way, and later to make it complete. My
thought is that we should now amend the bill

to provide that no regulation or order shall
be valid and effective for any purpose unless
it is properly fled.
In the case of the postmaster to which
I referred, I asked the question: If the postmaster told his secretary to close the door,
would that be an order enforceable in law
under the Post Office Act? I am not sure
that it would not; certainly it would be
enforceable if the postmaster wrote the order
on a slip of paper and handed it to his
secretary.
I believe that we should insist upon regularity in these matters, and nothing should
have the force of law until it goes through a
recognized procedure. The bill proposes a
proper procedure, that of filing in a public
place. Failure to file would render the regulation merely a pious hope or a wishful
admonition. Further, there should be a lapse
of time after the filing of regulations before
they become effective, as in the case of Acts
passed by parliament.
The difficulties which will be encountered
in the application of this measure will be
considerable, but not insurmountable. I
understand that it is intended that regulations
made in the past will now have to be filed.
Could the honourable deputy leader enlighten
me on that point?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think the bill
applies to past orders, but I will have a few
words to say on that point when my friend is
through speaking.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think it should apply
to orders and regulations already made, and
to administrative orders as well as those
which regulate civil rights and rights in
criminal matters. I believe that the department which prepared this bill should revise it
and make it complete.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I was much interested in my honourable
friend's remarks about his experience when
lie was in the Government of Ontario. As to
the question of the statutory effect of orders
in council which have been passed up to
date, I understand that under the authority of
an order in council passed on July 20 last, a
consolidation of all statutory orders and
regulations in effect as of December 31 last is
in the course of preparation, and will be
published in due course. In fact, it is now
in the hands of the printers. For the first
time in Canada there will exist an official compilation of all so-called subsidiary legislation.
This consolidation will be, therefore, in a
certain sense, a supplement to the statutes of
Canada. Perhaps that will answer my honourable friend's inquiry as to why this bill

MARCH 16, 1950
is not made retroactive. There will very
shortly be available a consolidation of all the
orders in council up to December 31.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that for the province
of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, it is a federal
matter.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If some particular regulation does not get into this book to which
my friend refers, would it still be valid?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not quite follow
my friend's question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If a certain regulation
does not get into this book, will it still be
regarded as an enforceable regulation?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Certainly, if it appears
in the Canada Gazette.
Hon. Mr.. Roebuck: There are lots of regulations which have not appeared in the Gazette,
which nevertheless are enforceable. The case
I referred to was just such an instance.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity a question?
Would it not be possible for him to move an
amendment in committee to the effect that
this book to which reference has been made
will be the final book, and that no regulation
not contained in it will be enforceable?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A jolly good idea!
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Will this book be distributed in the same manner as the statutes
of Canada?

finds he is affected. In the firm of which I
have the honour to be a member I tried to
have one of the office staff attend to these
matters; but after six months I nearly had a
rebellion on my hands. I was told: "Ever9
week one of these books comes in with the
statutory regulations, showing that something
passed six months ago has been repealed"; or
"Some person has borrowed it and has not
brought it back," or "It cannot be found."
There was just an uproar, and finally we gave
up trying to rely on it and threw it in the
waste-basket. I suggest that the leader should
consult the government to see whether it is
possible, when the bill gets to committee, to
answer the question of the honourable member from Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). He
has made a real point, one well worthy of
consideration. The difficulty is a serious one.
Take, for example, the regulations affecting
rent control. It is almost impossible for any
lawyer to keep up to date with them; yet
questions affecting the law and the administration arise every day in almost every
office. At the present time copies of the regulations are sent to members of the Senate and
members of the House of Commons. I do not
know whether they could be circulated also
to all lawyers; but they might be sent to law
libraries, judges and magistrates. In Manitoba
the provincial statutes are dispatched to the
libraries, the legislators, senators who are
lawyers, and magistrates all over the province. It is a very useful service. I suggest
that, following the question raised by the
honourable member from Toronto-Trinity,
some effort be made to include this book
under the legislation, and to bring it up to
date.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That again is a question
of administration, which I should think would
be susceptible to answer by the departmental

SENATE
IMMIGRATION
MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mrs. Wilson that
the Standing Committee on Immigration and
Labour be authorized and directed to examine
into the Immigration Act, its operation,
administration, etc.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, my name appears at the bottom of the
resolution today, and I cannot allow this
occasion to pass without some words of commendation and approval of the action taken by
the honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) in again bringing forward this
motion on immigration.
Honourable senators realize, no doubt, that
we would not have had the advance in immigration law, nor, probably, the modest numbers of immigrants that we have had, if the
Senate had not interested itself in the subject
some three or four years ago. I regard with
great satisfaction what this house has accomplished in the formation of public opinion, in
the bringing about of more modern regulations, and in adding to the sum total of our
knowledge of this subject. I have some satisfaction also in the thought that there are today
is not an
some thousands-"thousands"
exaggeration-of happy homes here in Canada
that might not have been established but for
our industry and our efforts. At least we had
something to do with it. I congratulate the
chairman of the committee for having again
brought the subject forward, with a view to
reviewing the inquiry; for we did very little
about it last session. Today it has a timeliness
and an importance that it did not have last
year; and this, for two outstanding reasons.
The first is that immigration to Canada during
the past year was less than in the previous
year. The figures which were given by the
mover of the resolution show a considerable
reduction; and this I regret. In point of numbers our immigration since the war has been
on a modest scale. It is very important; but
in terms of percentage of our total population
the figures are not impressive.
When one considers it in the light of human
happiness and well-being, the subject of immigration is of the widest and greatest and deepest importance. Nor is it to be despised even
on a numerical basis. I have in my hand a
newspaper report of a statement made by Sir
Arthur Rucker, Deputy Director of the International Refugee Organization, and of course
an authority on refugees. He complimented
Canada on having received something in the
order of 75,000 refugees since the close of the
war. That is an achievement not to be lightly
At all events it was not
brushed aside.
regarded as of small importance by one of the
head officials of the refugee organization.

As to this falling-off in numbers it may be
a matter for consideration whether this trend
is desirable, in face of an industrial situation
such as has not presented itself to us in recent
years. Today there are reported to be some
350,000 unemployed registered at the employment offices of the Unemployment Insurance
Commission. The figures are open to dispute:
some say there are more, some less; but it
would appear that about 375,000 of our people
are out of work. This figure may have little
significance unless it is related to the other;
but it means that there are approximately
100,000 more unemployed now than at the
same time last year. When one considers this
figure from the standpoint of the increase in
unemployment it seems most serious, and I do
not wonder at the pause which it gave the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) when
speaking to this subject just the other day.
No one who remembers the hungry thirties
and the thousands of men who were unable
to provide for their families, or who can
recall the picture of the long lines of weary
men queueing up at the soup kitchens, can
contemplate anything like that happening
again without being deeply concerned. It is
certain that if such a condition lies waiting
around the corner we would hesitate to bring
people to Canada who would simply have to
line up with our unemployed. It would be a
poor service to the immigrants and a poorer
service to ourselves.
I do not feel the answer to this horrible
problem is that unemployment is consequent
upon over-population; therefore I do not feel
that reduction in numbers is a solution. The
two are separate. The fact that numbers do
not spell unemployment was well illustrated
when the members of our armed forces came
back from overseas to become absorbed in
our industries, to be immediately followed
by considerable immigration to Canada, and
the employment situation was never better in
this country.
As unemployment is found both in countries
that are heavily populated and in countries
that are sparsely populated, I contend that
the actual numbers of those seeking work is

on two factors: the natural resources upon
which labour may be expended, and the
organization which is necessary in these
times to effectively apply our labour, enterprise and capital to those natural resources.
This seems to be fundamental and elementary,
and a high employment figure is the result
of good organization in the use of available
natural resources.
Canada is fortunate in the way of business
organization. No nation in all history was
ever able to change its method of production

MARCH 16, 1950
as rapidly and with as much facility, intelligence and enterprise as did Canada when it
last went to war. Managerial ability is
always the scarcest labour commodity. Men
skilled in management are invaluable to
industry, and apparently this country has a
large force of eminently capable businessmen,
manufacturers, traders and financiers, who
are quite capable of handling our industrial
processes. As to the availability of natural
resources, it is obvious that the development
of Canada's vast resources has only just
begun, the surface has only been scratched,
and the idea that there are too few jobs for
our population is a fallacy. There are as
many jobs as there are people to do them,
just as there is enough air for every living
person to breathe. And this condition will
continue so long as there is space for men
to stand and natural resources of land and
forest and mine for people to utilize.
There is no limit to the number of jobs to
be done. The only limitation lies in the availability of resources.
Honourable senators
may travel from Halifax to Vancouver in
search of a natural resource upon which to
employ their capital and labour at a profit
and, because of the price at which the resource
is held, fail to find anything irrespective of
how valuable and useful to mankind it might
be. So the real problem that faces us in this
matter of employment is not the possession of
resources-which we have in vast quantities
-nor the ability of our businessmen to use
them, nor the willingness and the intelligence
of our working population. The real problem
is the availability of resources which may be
used at a profit.
When you permit men to come into your
country you add to the forces of those ready
to carry the overhead, to pay the rent, to keep
the railroads running and to maintain a profit
for businessmen. But when you close the
door to outsiders you reduce the effectiveness
of your labour forces, you make it more
difficult to carry your overhead, and consequently reduce the likelihood of being able to
make a profit. The whole thing depends on
maintaining a profit for business and not
allowing too large a portion of this profit to
be carried off by mere ownership, forestalling
and monopoly.
During the last ten years land values in
Canada have been growing, and this has been
a detriment to employment. I wrote to the
Bureau of Statistics for information on the
growth of land values during recent years,
and strange to say, although this subject is of
vital importance when one considers the
future of Canadian industry, the Bureau could
supply me with but little information. I was
informed that the average value of occupied
farmland in Canada for 1949 was $40 per

acre, but included in this was the value of
the improvements on the farm. Now, improvements are the result of men's labour.
The value of the farm itself is a site value
and à community value, and when owned by
an individual it is a monopoly value.
Since 1939 the value of our farm lands all
across the country has increased by 66-7 per
cent. In the period from 1935 to 1939 they
were valued at $24 per acre.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: That is an average, is it
not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, that is an average.
It takes in a good deal of pretty poor land.
During the war years the average value
steadily grew, until today it stands at $40 an
acre, an increase, as I have said, of 66.7 per
cent since 1939.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Would that increase in
value be largely attributable to improvements
in buildings?
Hon. Mr. Hoebuck: Not largely, but to some
extent. And in the consideration of this subject, what is more important than the increase
and improvement in buildings is the decrease
in the value of money. Let us not forget that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: So the real increase in
value has perhaps not been quite so large as
the figures would indicate. There is very
little real land value in Canadian farms,
except in those which surround our big cities
and towns, where there is site value. Land
values in the cities and towns themselves have
advanced in spectacular fashion. I am sorry
that the actual figures are not available, but
the value of lands in our urban areas and
the immediately surrounding districts has
increased by, not merely hundreds of
thousands of dollars, but by many millions.
Now, consider that from the standpoint of
the immigrant. As a rule be comes here without much capital, though, perhaps with some,
and he is greatly affected by the price at
which the resources of the country are held.
If the price is low, his chance of making a
good living is all the greater. The higher the
price at which the resources are held, the
less is his likelihood of success. Every dollar
that is taken by monopoly and forestalling
means a dollar less for industry and enterprise. So our immigration problem is not
exactly one of the number we can admit, but
rather one of the number who can be
absorbed under our economic conditions.
I have not lost hope, honourable senators,
that our economy is still sound, though I
grant you that to thoughtful people there is
some reason for anxiety. Businesses go into
the red when exactions become too severe,

SENATE
but so far neither our land values nor our
business failures have so increased as to make
it wise for us to close our doors against the
hungry people of Europe. Furthermore, if
instead of bringing in fifty or sixty or one
hundred thousand people a year we brought
in many more than that, the period when
exactions consume profit will be deferred,
not hastened. In that way we might keep
business on a profitable basis longer than
we otherwise could, and thus postpone the
evil day.
There are one or two comments that I wish
to make about immigrants themselves. In one
of my early speeches on this subject I said
that the best "immigrants" are those who are
brought to us by the stork, and that sentiment
was repeated yesterday by my honourable
friend from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis). There
is no doubt that our own children make the
best additions to our population. The next
best are relatives of people already living and
established here. That proposition is so
obvious that after we had stated it three or
four times in this house it was adopted by the
government, and a category of near relatives
admissible as immigrants was published.
Immigration officials were authorized to admit
people within that category, and as a result
many thousands of fathers and mothers,
brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and
some few nephews and nieces, have been
brought to Canada. The experiment has shown
that these newcomers have the highest prospects of becoming successful citizens, because
they have the guidance of relatives already
established here, who welcome them, see to it
that they are properly housed and clothed,
and, above all, advise them on how to make
a living in this country. In some instances
people here have even paid the transportation
expenses of relatives living abroad who
wished to become Canadians. Almost all the
people who have been admitted within the
category of near relatives have been absorbed
into industry and have themselves made good.
But, honourable senators, the category of
near relatives that I have enumeratedfathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons
and daughters, nephews and nieces-is
obviously limited by the number of relatives
that Canadians have in Europe and other
countries, and it is now nearly exhausted. It
is true that over the years a few people of
this class would continue to come in, but we
cannot expect large numbers of such immigrants within the next two or three years. So
it strikes me that it is time to revise the
categories of persons admissible. Family
relationships in Europe are very strong. A
family is linked by iron bands, and its relationships are not limited to father and mother,
brothers and sisters and the other relatives

that I have mentioned, but extend throughout
the entire family connection. It does seem
to me that if a Canadian citizen is prepared
to pay the transportation expenses of, say, a
cousin and family from Europe, and to
guarantee that they will be housed and that
he will take an interest in their welfare here,
such immigrants would not be likely to become a public charge; and provided that
they met the usual requirements as to health
and good character, we would not be taking
much chance in admitting them. I do feel
the time has arrived when we should extend
the category of near relatives so as to take
in cousins. I would go even further and
admit friends as immigrants, because it is far
better to bring in a new Canadian citizen
who is guaranteed by somebody already in
Canada, than to bring in someone without
friends to introduce them to our industrial
and social life. For my part, I would be
willing to pass regulations immediately extending immigration privileges to cousins of
immigrants, and I would very seriously consider the possibility of extending it to friends.
To my mind such people would make good
citizens, the kind most likely to succeed and
most unlikely to leave or get into trouble with
our laws.
Those are my only two observations. First,
I should like to sec our present immigration
policy maintained as long as reasonably possible; and I hope that the warnings of
industrial disaster will not interfere with that
policy. Second, I would admit cousins at
once, and then friends.
I think the members of the committee
charged with the job of inquiring into the
Immigration Act will do a great service to
Canada if they discuss the problems on this
elementary basis.
The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I am pleased to associate myself with
the previous speakers and to congratulate both
the mover (Hon. Mr. Golding) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Veniot) of the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne. They
performed their tasks in a realistic and
objective manner, for which they deserve
commendation.
The war has now been over for four years
-at least that-is what we are told-nevertheless, we live under a disquieting and nervous

MARCH 16, 1950
tension which at times induces discouragement. Today, it is the atomie bomb, and
tomorrow it may be the hydrogen bomb,
which is a hundred times more devastating.
That is said to be progress. Yes, but it is
progress towards self-destruction. Can it be
true that genius borders upon madness?
But progress is reconcilable with a world
in which life would be better, in which men
could love one another rather than live in an
atmosphere of anxiety and hate, trying to
destroy one another.
How should. the world be organized so
that men would behave like reasonable beings
instead of imitating the wild beasts of the
jungle? A moral economy would first have
to be devised. If men work only at producing
instruments of warfare aimed at their mutual
destruction, it is because there is too much
pride in their minds and too much bitterness
in their hearts. Let humility, the spirit of
mutual help and comprehension, be substituted for pride; let that selfishness that
reigns in the hearts of men be replaced by
a little love. Thus the world will improve,
and then we shall be able to live in peace
and happiness.
But is it possible to enjoy happiness in this
world? Yes, it certainly is possible, provided
one is content with one's lot and does not
envy that of others. If ever we rose to a
level of perfection and of moral behaviour
where men would love one another rather
than hate, where all human inventions would
serve to ease man's life without rendering
him lazy or destroying the result of his
labour, we would also have to concern ourselves with organizing a material and a
physical economy-a material economy of
nations, a physical economy of individuals.
A nation's economy is based upon the extent
to which it can exchange its goods, and as
yet but one means has been devised of
furthering that exchange. That means is
money.
In the last century the civilized nations of
the world agreed to base their currencies on
a standard that was accepted by all as nothing but the equivalent of an international
currency. Instead of using paper money
made to the order of an individual country,
debtor nations could then send gold to their
creditors, and they in turn could pass it on
to other countries and thus circulate it all
around the world, if they so desired.
After World War I Germany strove to
break that practice which was based on confidence. She gave up the gold standard then
accepted* by all civilized nations, and issued
large quantities of her own paper notes,
thereby causing a tremendous inflation of her
currency in order to avoid paying her debts.
Some of Germany's neighbouring countries
which were in competition with her on inter-

national markets also put increased quantities of their own paper money into circulation; others devalued their currencies, or
effectively increased the price of gold. As a
result we have today what are called nationalized or managed currencies.
A study of the economic history of the
world since money was introduced, and the
conclusions to be drawn therefrom, would
lead us to believe that no material problem
of an economic nature can be solved through
nationalized currencies.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancour:
One cpuntry,
through her gold reserves, might for a time
succeed in dominating the world financially
but inevitably a day would come when,
despite her accumulated billions, she would
die because of the resulting concentration of
her currency. She could no longer carry on
trade with foreign countries because in her
eyes their currencies would bé practically
worthless. She would then be forced either
to make loans and to live on the interest that
would be paid on them, or to change her
policy. That to my mind, is plain.
But would it not be possible to agree on
the establishment of a standard for the currencies of all countries, and thus make
exchanges possible through some means other
than almost worthless paper? With nationalized currencies what happens?
If I sell
millions of dollars worth of goods to China
and she pays me with Chinese notes, what do
I actually get in exchange? Is not the payment a mere illusion on my part? I confess
that international currency today presents a
problem very difficult of solution, much more
difficult than it was some twenty-five or
thirty years ago. The reason is quite simple.
If a strike develops in a nation's vital industry, there is danger that the entire economy
of that nation may be changed, and along
with it the very basis of its currency. It is
equally dangerous if there is-as often happens-a world monopoly in some commodity.
Such a situation may affect any currency,
even one that is international.
The fact that the problem is complex and
difficult, however, should not prevent us from
grappling with it with a view to solving it.
Despite the peculiar character of these
remarks, may I hope that what I say will be
taken seriously and that some action will
follow. In our general trade policy certain
changes have to be made. Our customers of
yesterday are leaving us, and we must look
for new ones. To attract prospective customers we need skillful planning and people well
adapted to the countries in which they are
going to work. A few days ago I was talking to a group of Canadian businessmen who
had been in South America a few months

SENATE

before. These men, whether French-speaking or English-speaking, were unanimous in
suggesting that it would be useless to send as
business agents to South America people who
do not possess a mentality that will adapt
itself to the commercial practices and the
.way of life of South American citizens.
Yet, would it not be wise ta send to these
foreign countries people with some kind of
business experience? We have confidence in
intellectual attainments of those young
people who graduate from our universities
and our specialized schools of commerce and
industry.
Nevertheless, before assigning
them to our various embassies and commercial posts abroad, should we not put them
through some field experience here so that
they may learn ta distinguish between possible and impossible things? They will be the
first to benefit from that experience, even
long before their country, in due course, may
take advantage of their great knowledge
based on first-hand and high-grade experience.
I wish ta take this opportunity to bring to
the attention of this house the forthcoming
celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of one
of our financial institutions which has lived,
and continues to live, within reality, and
which has rendered incalculable services to
the nation as a whole. I refer to Les Caisses
Populaires, or the Credit Unions.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Next summer, from
the 24th to the 27th of August there will take
place in Levis, Quebec, an international convention of savings and credit co-operative
institutions, and leaders from all parts of the
world will be present. We shall then commemorate the life and work of the late
Alphonse Desjardins, founder of that wonderful co-operative movement of the North
American continent. This modest citizen of
Levis, a former civil servant was, with his
indomitable energy and determination, the
Canadian creator of this regenerating movement which means so much for the economic
and general salvation of the working classes.
In my city of Levis we have erected a
monument to commemorate this anniversary:
it is a building which is called "Edifice
Desjardins-Desjardins Building". In that
building we have centralized all the institutions which if not in fact created by the late
Alphonse Desjardins were inspired by him. I
gladly avail myself of the present opportunity
to extend to leaders of the co-operative movement in all parts of the world a cordial welcome ta this celebration. May they come from
everywhere, these leaders of the co-operative
movement! May they bring to us the best of
their minds and hearts and the fruitful help of

their knowledge and experience! Perhaps,
through the many sessions of intense study
that will then be held, we shall succeed in
laying the foundations of a more Christian,
more social, more charitable and more human
economy.
When Mr. Desjardins the founder of the
first credit union, died in 1920, the press
hailed him as the saviour of his race. Thirty
years later I can say that he was more than
the saviour of his race; he was the promoter
of a more human economy, and he may well
have been the saviour of the economy of the
whole nation.
Another anniversary of special interest to
me is to be celebrated in the fall of 1950. It
is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of the Quebec Maple Sugar Producers'
Society.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: For a quarter of a
century this society has endeavoured to revive
the maple sugar industry, which is the oldest
agricultural industry in this country, and ta
restore to it its original worth, which had
been lost. On the occasion of its silver jubilee,
La Société des Producteurs de Sucre d'Erable
du Québec is proud ta be able ta remind our
farmers of the powerful lift which they got
through its work, and to say that this national
product is appreciated, savoured and liked by
all who have been fortunate enough to taste
it.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Including senators!
Hon. Mr. Vaillancour: To sum up, let us
work towards the organization of a moral
and social economy that will be based upon
charity and the love of men. We are told
that we fought the last war ta save Christian
civilization. Did Christ come down on earth
to teach us anything else but the moral economy of mutual love? By looking into the
past and realizing what our ancestors have
built and created through that spirit of love,
mutual help and charity, by following the
lead which they gave us, let us also strive to
base our material economy on something concrete and real. I am not one of those who
will mournfully look back to times and things
bygone, and moan over the present and
despair of the future. I am rather one of
those who mildly remember the past, try to
cope realistically with the present, and face
the future with confidence, because there still
are at the head of our organizations people
who believe and love.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Burke the debate

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson presented Bill I, an Act
to amend The Criminal Code.
The bill was read the first time.
ST. PATRICK'S DAY
TRIBUTE TO IRELAND'S PATRON SAINT

Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with may I remind the house that today is the
17th of March.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: It is the festival of that
glorious apostle, St. Patrick, and Irishmen
throughout the world are venerating their
patron saint with love and adoration. The
Englishman bas his St. George, but St. George
never saw the sky over England. Neither did
St. Andrew ever see the sky over Scotland,
or St. David the sky over Wales. But Patrick,
at the age of fifteen, was taken in slavery to
Ireland, and served as a shepherd in serfdom
for six years. Finally he escaped, and went
to France. There be told his uncle, St. Martin
of Tours, about Ireland and its people and
how he had come to love and admire them.
He told him what wonderful opportunities
there would be for missionary work among
the pagan people of Ireland, who worshipped
the sun and various idols.
St. Martin educated Patrick, who eventually
was ordained to the priesthood and sent to
Rome, where he had an audience with the
Pope and told him of Ireland and its people.
He said that if he were given a commission as
a missionary be would go among the Irish
people and devote his life to their conversion.
He was granted this commission and consecrated a bishop, and with a band of missionaries he returned to Ireland.
The story is told that St. Patrick reached
Ireland on the eve of the grand festival of the
Druids, and that when the Druids met on the
hills of Tara to venerate their heathen gods,
Patrick arrived on the opposite hill with his
little band of missionaries. Arising at daybreak the next morning his first thoughts
were of Almighty God, and be went on his
bended knees and asked God for his blessing
55950-8

on the mission work which *he had undertaken. In the cold of the morning be lighted
a fire. This was against the edict of the archDruid, who had ordered that no fire was to
be lit on that day until he himself had set the
torch. Patrick knew nothing of this, and his
fire was observed in Tara. Immediately the
king sent his soldiers to seize the man who
had dared to break the law, and Patrick was
brought before the king and the arch-Druid,
and was asked to explain his conduct. He then
told them of the Christian God in Heaven, and
with his wonderful oratory be impressed the
assembled gathering. But be could not make
them understand the mystery of the Blessed
Trinity until, looking down at his feet, be saw
a trefoil, a three-leafed shamraock, and he
stooped and plucked it from the ground and
held it aloft to illustrate the mystery of the
Blessed Trinity. Thus he showed them how
nature itself could explain how there could
be three in one. Then be was asked to explain
the other mysteries of his religion, which he
did so well that be converted the whole nation
to Christianity, and that is why the Irishmen
today venerate his memory.
Because of that Irishmen and Irishwomen
too throughout the world today wear on their
bosoms with pride the little shamrock, the
emblem of their nation and of their patron
saint. Because of seven centuries of persecution and suffering, Irishmen have been scattered all over the world. But go where you
will, in any part of this universe, you will find
Irishmen, every one of them just as much
imbued with the love and veneration of the
land of his forefathers as are those who were
born on its sacred soil.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: A few years ago I visited
Boston, where I met hundreds of Irishmen,
many of the third and fourth generation.
With love in their eyes they would speak
of Ireland as if it were the land of their
nativity. I recall a conversation with one
of them who was a very ardent and patriotic
Irishman. I said, "Mike, if you were not of
Irish nationality, what nationality would be
your second choice?" He said, "Sure, if I
wasn't an Irishman I'd be ashamed of myself." That but illustrates the love of the
Irishman and his descendants for the
Emerald Isle.
Well might they love it. You will find
no divorce courts there. If our friends of
the divorce committee were sitting in Ireland
and depending on fees from divorce cases,
they would starve to death. And you will
find there no birth control, no mercy killingeuthanasia-no communism, and the few
shakes and toads that were there were

SENATE

banished by St. Patrick centuries ago. So I
say we have reason to be proud of our native
land.
Go where you will, you will find an Irishman looking back on the green isle, thinking
of Kathleen, Mavourneen, Aileen Allanah,
Colleen Bawn, and Sweet Belle Mahone:
Wait for me at Heaven's gate,
Sweet Belle Mahone.

Others will look back and think of the
lakes of Killarney:
Where angels fold their wings and rest
In that Eden of the blest,
Beauty's home, Killarney.

Others will think of farther south and sing
of the Bells of Shandon.
That sound so grand on
The pleasant waters
Of the river Lee.

Others will sing the Londonderry Air, and
still others will sing of the mountains of
Mourne, of Galway Bay, and of Lough
Neagh's Banks:
Where the fisherman strays
When the clear cold eve's declining;
He sees the round towers of other days
In the waves beneath him shining.
Thus will memory oft in dreams sublime
Catch a glimpse of the days that are over,
And, sighing, look through the waves of time
For the long-faded glories they cover.

Others, more vigorous, will sing of the
glories of Brian the Brave, and of Malachi:
Who wore the collar of gold
Which he won from the proud invader,
When her kings, with standards of green
unfurled,
Led the red branch knights to danger.

Still others will sing of the beautiful vale
of Avoca:
There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet
As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet;
Oh! the last rays of feeling, and life must depart,
Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my
heart.
Yet it was not that nature had shed o'er the scene
Her purest of crystal and brightest of green;
'Twas not her soft magie of streamlet or rill,
Oh! no,-it was something more exquisite still.
'Twas that friends, the belov'd of my bosom,
were near.
Who made every dear scene of enchantment more
dear,
And who felt how the best charms of nature
improve,
When we see them reflected from looks that we
love.
Sweet vale of Avoca! how calm could I rest
In thy bosom of shade, with the friends I love best,
Where the storms that we feel in this cold world
should cease,
And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in
peace.
Several persons have asked me to sing, and

if I may be permittedSome Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: -I

will do so.

Have you ever heard the story of how Ireland got
its name?
If you listen you will understand from whence old
Ireland came.
No wonder that we love that dear old land beyond
the sea,
For here's the way my dear old mother told the
tale to me.
Sure a little bit of heaven fell from out the skies
one day,
And nestled on the ocean in a spot so far away;
And when the angel found it, sure it looked so
sweet and fair,
He said suppose we leave it, for It looks so peaceful
there.
Then they sprinkled it with stardust, just to make
the shamrocks grow;
'Tis the only place you'll find them, no matter where
you go.
Then they dotted it with silver to make its lakes so
grand,
And when they had it finished, sure they called it
Ireland.

Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Let me conclude:
O Erin, my country, though broken thou art,
There's a lustre within thee that ne'er will decay;
A spirit that shines through each suffering part,
And now smiles at all pain on St. Patrick's Day.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

the Speech from the Throne yesterday the
honourable senator from Halifax (Hon Mr.

question:
Speaking of publication, may I ask the honourable
leader of the government if he and honourable
senators on both sides of the house are satisfied with
the newspaper coverage of this honourable body?
I am not prepared today to answer the ques-

tion of my honourable friend. As it is of some
importance, I wish to reserve the :ight to give

MARCH 17. 1950

the matter and be prepared to give an answer
sometime next week.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved second reading of
Bill F, an Act respecting United Grain
Growers Limited.
H.e said: May I say a word of appreciation
of the eloquent address delivered a few
moments ago, on the occasion of St. Patrick's
Day, by the honourable senator from BedfordHalifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn), and of compliment
to him on the musical interludé which he
provided. I hope that some day one of our
members-perhaps my honourable friend
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon)-will
entertain us with a song like "The Road to
the Isles". That is a real song.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What about the bagpipes?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No; we draw the line there!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The bill of which I have
just moved second reading is "An Act respecting United Grain Growers Limited". The
explanatory notes are full and comprehensive,
and, I believe, have given honourable senators who have read them a full knowledge
of the purpose of the bill. However, as one
who in early years had something to do with
the United Grain Growers, perhaps I could
usefully add a few words of explanation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I make a suggestion
which, I think, would save some of our time?
The things in the bill which bother me are
the variations from the general law. I should
like the honourable senator to explain why
we are being asked to make them.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not quite sure what
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has in mind when he speaks of
"variations from the general law".
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I will discuss the
matter later.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Perhaps I may give a
short sketch of the history of this company.
It was organized in 1906 under the Manitoba Joint Stock Companies Act. By 1910
or 1911 its business had spread beyond the
boundaries of Manitoba, and it was thought
advisable by the directors and shareholders
to seek incorporation through a special Act of
the Canadian Parliament.
In 1917 further amendments were rendered
necessary by the fact that the shareholders of
the Grain Growers Grain Company, as it was
then known, had reached an understanding
with the board of directors and shareholders
55950-8à

of the Alberta Co-operative Elevator Company that the two organizations should fuse
and form one company. In 1917 the name
was changed from "Grain Growers Grain
Grain Growers
Company" to "United

obtained to increase the authorized capital to
the limit of $5 million. Another amendment
approved at that time provided that the vast
number of shareholders scattered over the
three prairie provinces could be organized
into what were known as "locals". Practically
all these locals were contiguous to elevators
which the company operated. The locals
met regularly in accordance with the by-laws,
and following the procedure therein laid
down appointed delegates to the annual
meetings. Delegates so appointed had all the
powers of shareholders for the purpose of
The

company undertook to pay the expenses of the
delegates to the annual meetings of the
company. That arrangement has continued
to the present time.
The purpose of those amendments will be
obvious to honourable senators. At that time
the shareholders numbered about 25,000. It
was impossible to get a fair representation
of all these shareholders at an annual meeting. The sponsors of the company desired to
avoid any possibility of control of the company passing into the hands of any particular
group of men. With that end in view, they
limited the number of shares that an individual could hold, and sales of shares were
confined to bona fide farmers.
By virtue of a further and very simple
amendment, secured in 1918, the company was
permitted to pay what was known as a patronage dividend. The underlying principle
was that if, after payment of ordinary cash
dividends and provision of an adequate
amount for reserve, there remained profits
in excess of the requirements of the business,
the company could distribute such profits on
a pro rata basis to all who had marketed
their grain through the organization.
The next amendments were secured in 1941.
I stated a

moment ago that there were two distinctive
features of the original organization. First,
that only farmers could qualify as shareholders. The object of this stipulation is
apparent. As already stated, it was feared
that some outside interest, perhaps some
competing company, by offering special
inducements to the existing shareholders,
would get control of the organization. There
was a further limitation, namely in the
number of shares an individual shareholder
could own. The shares were of a value of
$25 each. A difficulty had arisen which,
although foreseen in the early days by those

SENATE
who built the organization, had not been
dealt with. As time passed, more and more
shareholders passed away, and their shares,
of course, were included in their estates. The
fact that the holding of shares was limited
to farmers created a hardship in connection
with the clearing up of these estates. So in
1941 a change was made in the charter to
provide for two classes of shares: class A and
class B. The existing par value of the shares
of $25 was divided into twenty-dollar "A"
shares and five-dollar "B" shares. The "A"
shares were preferred as to dividends and, as
I recall it. could be held by non-farmers up to
a limit of 200 shares. The "B" shares were
the voting shares and could be sold only to
bona fide farmers.

shares regardless of whether or not the shareholder puts his wheat through the United
Grain Growers elevator?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Has there been any other
case where power has been given to a company to change the type of its shares by its
own resolution?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Authority is given here.
If the shareholders desire to do so, they can,
by a vote of two-thirds, create a new class
of shares. They might have a class "A" share
that would be a first preferred share, and a
Class "C" share that would be a second
preferred share, and a class "B" share which
would be the voting share. Any such change
would have to be agreed to by two-thirds of
the shareholders present at an annual meeting, and after proper notice.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Are the class "B" shares
the voting shares?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I am
familiar with this company and can vouch
that it is ably managed. My honourable
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was
a former president and general manager of
the company, and I knew his successors
because their offices were located in the same
building as our own.
The only question that arose in my mind
was as to the advisability of giving the company the power to change its stock by a
two-thirds majority vote. I know that power
can be given to change preferred stock to
common stock, but in this instance the type
of stock will be changed. If the company is
agreeable to this, however, I do not see any
objection.
In my opinion there is no necessity for
referring this bill to committee, but I do not
know the feeling of other honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Honourable senators, rule
117 of the Rules of the Senate provides that
all private bills, after their second reading,
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Private Bills.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: The honourable senator from L'Acadie is correct, and
therefore this bill should be referred to
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Or tenant farmers?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. These provisions
have continued until the present time and,
while the authorized capital of the company
is only $5 million, the company has extended
its operations.
The bill before us contains two important
provisions. First it seeks to raise the authorized capital to $7,500,000. Secondly, it has
been found since 1941 that the 200,000 authorized "B" shares are far beyond what is
necessary, and so the bill seeks to give the
shareholders, by proper resolution at an
annual meeting, the power to change 100,000
of the "B" shares into 20,000 "A" shares.
As I have already stated, the company has
been constantly expanding its operations, and
recently it purchased a substantial number of
elevators from one of the existing elevator
companies in Western Canada. Whenever the
company secures an elevator it seeks to get a
body of shareholders in the vicinity to form
a local such as I described earlier, and of
course it desires to sell shares to the farmers
in such a local.
Those are the two main provisions of the
bill, but there are others which have more to
do with the internal administration of the
company. The bill provides that certain things
can only be done by an authorized vote of
two-thirds of the shareholders present at an
annual meeting, and in other cases, by a
straight majority vote.
Honourable senators, I cannot see where
there can be any objection to this measure.
It is clear that the company needs the additional capital. It has too many class "B" shares
for its requirements, and the request to have
the authority to transform 100,000 of these

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Vincent P. Burke: Honourable senators, in continuing the debate on the Speech
from the Throne, I wish first to congratulate
the mover, and the seconder of the Address
in reply. I do so, not for the reason that custom directs such a course, but rather because
I honestly and sincerely believe that each of
them, in turn, made a valuable contribution
to the debates of the house and acquitted
himself in conformity with its best traditions.
I should like to take this opportunity of
expressing my appreciation to honourable
senators for the kindliness and courtesy with
which they have welcomed me to this
chamber.
Honourable senators, I am proud that my
native province, Newfoundland, has become a
part of the great Canadian nation, one of the
greatest nations of the world. I am proud to
be a citizen of Canada. In the national
referendum in Newfoundland there were
three choices-commission government, responsible government, or confederation. Confederation won, and probably 90 per cent of
our population are today in favour of confederation, thus indicating that its advocates had
taken the correct turning at the crossroads of
public opinion.
Newfoundland has many firsts to her credit
in history. It was here that England made her
first success in maritime discovery on that day
in June, 1497, when John Cabot's crew sighted
Cape Bonavista, the first land on this side of
the water to be seen by Englishmen. It was
here that she made her first attempt at colonization and empire building. It was the
banks of Newfoundland that first tempted
Englishmen forth from their narrow seas to
brave the billows of the Atlantic; and here on
the banks of Newfoundland were trained
those seamen who made England Mistress of
the Seas, and who carried her flag into every
sea and clime. It was here, in 1615, that England set up her first courts of justice in the
New World. It was here that the first transAtlantic cable station was built on this side
of the water. It was here, in Bay Bulls' Arm,
Trinity Bay, in 1858, that the first transatlantic message was received. It was here,
at Signal Hill, on December 12, 1901, that the
first wireless message was received by Signor
William Marconi. It was here, in the old city
of St. John's, on June 14, 1919, that those

gallant and intrepid airmen, Sir John Alcock
and Sir Arthur Whitten Brown, started on
the first successful non-stop aeroplane flight
from the New World to the Old, landing at
Clifden, Ireland, some sixteen hours after
leaving the old city of St. John's.
The first book ever written in the New
World was written in Newfoundland. This
book, entitled Quodlibits, was written by
Robert Hayman, Governor of John Guy's
Colony in Bristol's Hope, about 1622. Newfoundland was the first of the countries on the
American continent to adopt daylight saving
time-in June, 1917. The bill enacting the
legislation was sponsored by the late Honourable John Anderson.
I feel I should mention here another epochmaking event in the history of the world,
which took place in Newfoundland only
recently. I speak of the Council of Placentia,
August 9, 1941, at which was signed the
Atlantic Charter. H. V. Morton wonders "if
in years to come children will be taught the
date-'Council of Placentia, August 9, 1941'."
The Atlantic Charter ranks with Magna Carta,
so we have here in Newfoundland the Runnymede of the 20th century.
St. John's is ,the oldest city on the North
American continent north of Mexico. It was
an important port in 1527, and there were
bouses there 100 years before the Pilgrirn
Fathers landed at Plymouth Rock. Sabine
states in his history of the North American
Fisheries that in 1522 there were 40 or 50
houses in Newfoundland. The first settlers
in Newfoundland were the winter crews-men
left behind to erect and keep in order the
premises, and build and repair boats. Hayes,
who was with Sir Humphrey Gilbert on his
famous voyage in 1583 when he took possession of Newfoundland in the name of Queen
Elizabeth, writing in his Journal at St. John's,
mentions the weather observed in winter, also
the boats built in the new colony-clear proofs
of the existence of winter crews. Gilbert's
party seem to have been not very well supplied with provisions at the time, for Hayes
says:
Commissioners were appointed, part of our own
company and part of theirs to go into other
harbours adjoining (for our English merchants command ail there) to levy our provisions; whereupon,
the Portugals (above all other nations) did most
willingly and liberally contribute. In so much as,
we were presented (above our allowance) with
wines, marmalades, most fine rusk or biscuits, sweet
oils, and sundry delicacies; also we wanted not of
fresh salmon, trouts, lobsters, and other fresh fish,
brought daily unto us. Moreover, as the manner
is in fishing, every week to choose their Admiral
anew, or rather they succeed each in orderly
course, and have weekly their Admiral's feast
solemnized, even so the General, captains and
masters of our fleet were continually invited andi
feasted.

SENATE

Apparently they had a non-official Rotary
Club in St. John's in those days. It is quite
evident that Gilbert and his companions had
a very jovial time in St. John's-then, as
now, famous for its hospitality. Hayes, speaking of St. John's in 1583, refers to it as
"a place very populous and much frequented."
As our Newfoundland poet, Michael Harrington, says in his poem St. John's, the City
Maritime:
I am the city Maritime,
I am your mother and your father too;
Your god, your first love, your unshaken faith;
And sorrow in an old brown wound congealed,
Upon the sandstone hillside of my heart;
For though your blood is sluggish now and cool,
It will go hot yet in young veins unborn,
For I the unconquerable spirit of your thoughts,
I shall abide when bones are dust and still.

Shortly after Cabot's discovery of Newfoundland in 1497, the cry went forth that the
waters surrounding its coasts were teeming

with fish, a diet then largely used by Europeans. Immediately there was a rush by the
maritime nations of Europe to the New Isle,
in search of a share in the wealth which was
sure to be obtained from such a promising
suddenly
sea-harvest, and Newfoundland
burst forth into the limelight of publicity as
the Klondyke of the period.
Mindful of the immense quantities of fish
seen about our island by Cabot on his first
trip, other masters also came out the next
year, under his guidance, provided with fishThe number of
ing gear and fishermen.

English fishermen taking part in the Newfoundland fisheries had so increased by 1504
that His Majesty bethought him that he was
somewhat responsible for their spiritual welfare, and we find that the sum of two pounds
was paid by His Majesty for a priest to perform religious services in the New Isle. This
is the first record that we have of the establishment of religion in the island.
The English began fishing in Newfoundland, as we have seen, in 1498; the Portuguese
made their first trip in 1501, and the French
took up the trade in 1504. The Spanish came
later, in 1543. In 1577, out of about 400
ships employed in the fishery, there were 100
Spanish and 50 Portuguese ships; but they
rapidly diminished in numbers, and in a short
time withdrew almost entirely. The Spanish
and Portuguese soon turned to South America,
and thus the Newfoundland fisheries were left
to the English and French, and from them
both nations drew enormous wealth, and so
increased their nations' greatness.

The attention of England, as well as that of
France, was first drawn to North America by
the discovery of the fishery of Newfoundland.
France and England early engaged in the
prosecution of the cod-fisheries on the Banks

and around the shores of Newfoundland. The

English and French fishermen employed in
these fisheries supplied the navies and the
mercantile marine of both nations with bold
and skilful sailors, and thus developed their
power at sea. Both nations found here the
best nurseries 'for seamen. Both were thus
drawn to the region of the St. Lawrence, and
were led to plant colonies, originally, with a
view to carrying on the fisheries, and the
rivalry between the two powers to obtain the
sovereignty of the soil arose in connection
with the fisheries. The long wars between
France and England were avowedly for the
fisheries and the territories around them.
Thus the fisheries of Newfoundland really
laid the foundation of the empire which
England at length acquired in America, when
her supremacy was established after a long
contest with France.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burke: These fisheries were far
more influential in bringing about the settlement of North America than all the gold of
Mexico and Peru accomplished in Southern
America.
The Reverend Dr. Harvey said:
The humble, industrious fishermen, who plied
their hard labour along the shores and on the Banks
of Newfoundland and in the neighbouring seas,
were the pioneers of the great host from the Old
World who, in due time, built up the United States
and overspread Canada. They have done an honourable stroke of work in the great business of
the world. England owes much b them. Until
these fisheries drew her seamen from their narrow
seas, and taught thern to brave the storms of the
Atlantic, her merchant marine was of small account,
and her navy had scarcely an existence. In prosecuting these fisheries England learned how to become Mistress of the Seas. It was in Newfoundland too, that the great Mother of Colonies made
her first attempt at colonization. Here her flag first
waved over her possessions in the western hemisphere. Newfoundland is her oldest colony.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burke: The repulse of the Spanish

Armada was one of the greatest events in
history; and it is interesting to recall that
Newfoundland fishing ships, Newfoundland
crews and Newfoundland captains took part
in that historic fight. Captain Richard Whitbourne, a planter of Trinity for many years,
was there with Drake and Hawkins, in comrmand of his own large ship and two small
ones, all of which he fitted out at his own
expense. It was probably in great measure
as a reward for his services on this occasion
that he was knighted. One historian says
there is no doubt there were hundreds of
Newfoundland sailors present on that occasion-that is men who had served in the
Newfoundland fishing fleet.
Some time before this, Sir Walter Raleigh
said better care must be given by the British
Government to the Newfoundland fishing fleet,

MARCH 17, 1950
for if they were attacked by Spanish warships
it would be the greatest misfortune that could
possibly happen to England. This is an indication of how much importance was attached
to Newfoundland's fisheries and its fishing
fleet at that time by the leading men in
England.
Newfoundland sailors fought for the Empire
years before any other part of the Empire
Overseas, as we know it, was in existence.
One of the most spectacular incidents in connection with the defeat of the Spanish Armada
was the sending of the fire ships to Calais.
This project originated with two men connected with the Newfoundland trade, Prowse
and Young. Prowse was one of the most noted
sea captains of that wonderful age. His
exploits were set forth in Westward Ho. He
was connected with the fisheries of Newfoundland, and the Armada Memorial at Plymouth
bears the Prowse arms in honour of his share
in that great victory.
As early as 1618 a fort was built by the
inhabitants of St. John's as a place where
they might shelter when attacked by foes.
This fort was then known as The Fort and
was subsequently styled the North Fort. When
a fort was built on the south side, it was
called the South Fort. These forts were built
and manned by the inhabitants, and no regular soldiers were stationed there until 1697,
when Lieutenant Colonel Handyside and three
hundred men were left at St. John's for the
winter. John Downing of Quidi Vidi, in his
narrative of 1676, said that guns were mounted
in a fort at St. John's, and the fort was supplied with small arms for the use of the
William
inhabitants who garrisoned it.
Downing and Thomas Oxford, on behalf of
the inhabitants of St. John's, petitioned the
King for twenty-five guns and two hundred
small arms to defend the harbour and some
small arms to defend the creek "Que de Vide."
I am informed that Downing Street in
London was named after William Downing.
A few years previously, in 1665, the Dutch
had attacked St. John's and destroyed the
fort, which was again rebuilt, and another
was erected on the south side of the Narrows.
In Thornton's map of St. John's, dated 1689,
the North Fort is shown as being about where
Fort William was situated, and the South
Fort on the site of Fort Amherst at the
entrance to the Narrows. On April 5, 1680,
Robert Robinson asked leave to use his
"crew and such planters as are willing to
raise fortifications, which shall be done with
no expense except a little brandy to the crew
for labouring." This was in all probability
the commencement of a new fort on the site
of Fort William. It appears to have been
first called Fort William in 1697. It was

named after the King, William III. King
William was in constant danger after Queen
Mary's death in 1694, and in 1696 a plot was
arranged to murder him on his return from
The
hunting, in a lane near Richmond.
indignation of the country was very great at
this infamous plot, and an association was
formed to avenge William's death in case of
his murder, and to support the succession of
Anne. It was at the time of this outburst of
loyalty to the king that the North Fort was
named Fort William.
In 1696 Newfoundland fishermen in the
town of St. John's, under Robert Miners, who
had been elected by the populace as the
governor of the town, put up a most heroic
defence at Fort Williani-where the Newfoundland Hotel now stands-against the
French who had marched overland from
Placentia. At last the water and food in the
fort gave out and they had to surrender. But
they did not surrender unconditionally, they
surrendered under articles. The French
guaranteed to the inhabitants of the Harbour
of St. John's, upon quiet surrender:
. . . that you shall have good quarter, and those
that will have boats to go in the Bay shall have
them tomorrow, and those that will go for England
shall have two ships to carry them home, and they
shall have one pound of bread per day for each
person for a month and all necessities convenient
for the passage.

The French Chaplain Boudoin said:
This fort was situated on the hill to the North
West, commanded on one side by two heights both
within gun shot of it. It was square in shape, with
four bastions, a palisade eight feet high, a covered
trench, now full of snow, also a drawbridge, with
a small tower upon which there were four cannons,
the balls for which weighed four pounds, under the
tower there was a cellar for keeping gunpowder.

Before vacating St. John's, the French
burnt and destroyed everything movable, and
immovable, there was not a solitary building
left standing, and all the forts were razed to
the ground. In 1697, when it was too late, a
large squadron, under Admiral Norris, with
1,500 soldiers, was sent out to recapture Newfoundland; they found St. John's completely
abandoned. The soldiers were set to work at
once, and Fort William was again erected on
the site of the old fort, under the direction of
a Mr. Richards of the Royal Engineers. Only
the palisade was erected-during the first year,
but between 1698 and 1708, the ramparts
were faced with brick and bomb-proof parapets, and powder magazines and barracks
were erected. A fort, named Fort George,
was built near the water's edge due south
from Fort William, about where now stands
the office of Messrs. Furness, Withy and
Company, and the two points were connected
by a subterraneous passage. All the work
about Fort William was the work of English
engineers in 1697, and was added to from

SENATE
time to time. In 1690 a small church was
built within the precincts of the fort in which
the Reverend John Jackson officiated.
In February, 1705 the French, under Subercase, again invaded St. John's, and made an
attempt to take Fort William; but it was so
ably defended by Lieutenant Moody that the
French returned to Placentia after pillaging
the surrounding settlements.
In December, 1708 a French force, under
St. Ovide de Brouillon, arrived overland from
Placentia and attacked St. John's, taking Fort
William and Fort George, and compelling the
garrison at the South Fort, now Fort Amherst,
to surrender. The forts were afterwards
strengthened, and for over fifty years no
attempt was made by the French to retake
St. John's. On the 27th of June, 1762 however, four French ships of war, after taking
Bay Bulls, appeared off St. John's and captured it. The fortifications had been neglected
and only a small force of regulars was in
charge. The French set to work to repair
the old fortifications and erect fresh defences
on Signal Hill. On the 1lth of September
Lord Colville, with a fleet and transports,
appeared off St. John's, landed men at Torbay
and proceeded to attack the French. He was
successful, and captured a French force to
the number of 710, the French fleet of five
vessels escaping from St. John's in a thick
fog.
Newfoundland seamen fought at Camperdown, at Copenhagen, at the Nile and at
Trafalgar. Newfoundlanders also fought to
defend Canada in 1775 during the time of the
revolt of the American colonies.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burke: The Americans had taken
possession of Montreal and other places, and
it looked as if all Canada would be taken;
but Quebec still held out. Newfoundland
sent to Canada a contingent which had been
recruited here by Captain Colin Campbell.
The arrival of this contingent at Quebec put
great heart in the people, and the Newfoundlanders helped in the defence of that historic
city. A Canadian officer stated that this contingent saved Canada for the British.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burke: In 1795 Henry Pynn, a
Harbour Grace volunteer, was drafted to the
English Army and became one of Wellington's right hand men in the Peninsular War.
He was knighted by the Portuguese for his
services, and again by His Majesty the King
of England.
I shall now refer to the old Royal Newfoundland Regiment and the year 1796. The
levy of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment
had been completed in the fall of 1795, and

it was found that the barracks at Fort Townsend and Fort William were insufficient to
contain so many men. It was therefore
ordered that the garrison should go under
canvas for a few months while the old barracks were being repaired and cleaned. A
camp was accordingly formed on the general
parade ground, with a small park of artillery,
of which the troops took possession about the
middle of June in 1796.
The improved defences of the Narrows
being finished, some experiments were tried
with heated shot before His Excellency
Admiral Sir James Wallace, the governor,
which gave general satisfaction. And this
was well, for early in the morning of the
first day in September the signal was made
for an enemy's fleet to the southward, which
proved to be that of the French Admiral
Richery, consisting of seven sail of the line,
two frigates, and some other small vessels of
war. The signal of alarm and defiance was
instantly made at Signal Hill and all the
forts. There was only the governor's ship
and one frigate in port. His Excellency
Admiral Sir James Wallace immediately proclaimed martial law, and ordered all the men
in the town fit for service-merchants with
their domestic and wharf establishments,
captains of vessels with their crews, planters
with their fishermen and shoremen-to muster in front of the camp, where they were
enrolled and told off to the forts and the
batteries, and were not to be dismissed until
the governor's pleasure was known. There
was a real war-like demonstration, and the
display of three or four thousand men on the
Hill, must have had a very intimidating effect
on the enemy when viewed from sea. The
clever old admiral, we are told, also got
several hundred women up on Signal Hill,
so that the garrison would look very much
larger than it really was. After remaining in
sight for several days, the enemy sailed
southward and captured and burnt Bay Bulls,
but the old city of St. John's still stood.
This was probably the first time in Newfoundland's history, and probably the first
time in the history of the British Empire
overseas, that an officer commanding in war
time called up the women to do their part
in the defence of their city and country.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burke: Se, you see, we had our
Women's Division in Newfoundland over one
hundred and forty years before we had the
privilege and pleasure, which we valued, of
extending a hearty welcome to those beautiful daughters in gray from Canada's fair
domain.
In the American War of 1812, the Royal
Newfoundland Regiment took part in the

MARCH
defence of Canada. They fought at Lake
Erie, at York and other places. As might be
expected, some of the Newfoundland Regiment also served at sea, for I find in a record
of date October 20, 1812, that Lieutenant
A. H. Bulger, Lieutenant Lundrigan, five petty
officers and 55 privates of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment were serving on board
H.M.S. Royal George. On February 22, 1813,
the Newfoundlanders led the advance in the
capture of Ogdensburg. In this action the
Newfoundland Regiment was mentioned in
despatches, special reference being made to
"the brave conduct of the Newfoundland
Regiment who led the advance guard." The
Royal Newfoundland Regiment also fought at
the evacuation of Fort Goeorge on May 27,
1813.
Newfoundlanders
also fought in the
Crimean* War, and we are told that Joe
Robins of Lower Island Cove was the first
man to enter the breach at Sebastopol. He
climbed the top of the parapet and called out:
"Three cheers for Newfoundland."
Newfoundlanders have also fought in India;
and in the last war, when the renowned city
of Jerusalem surrendered to General Allenby,
I am told that General Sir John Shea, a Newfoundlander, who had distinguished himself
in India, was one of the generals to whom the
troops defending the city surrendered.
Newfoundlanders also took part as individuals in the Boer War; and certainly the
gallant Royal Newfoundland Reservists, and
the gallant members of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment played a heroic part in the
Great War of 1914-1918, in which 9,500 Newfoundlanders served. They brought honour
to the name of Newfoundland, and in France,
at the battle of Beaumont Hamel on July 1,
1916, they fought so splendidly and so heroically that General Sir Hunter Weston, in
addressing the three score men or so who
returned-"all that was left of them" after
the charge against the enemy during that
day-said: "Newfoundlanders, I salute you.
You are better than the best."
Newfoundland was the first of the overseas
dominions to engage in the wars of Britain.
Newfoundlanders have proved themselves
brave and skilful seamen .and soldiers during
nearly four centuries, and our men of today
are worthy descendants of their forefathers
who fought for the Empire in days gone by.
Again 10,000 Newfoundlanders took part
in the second grim and desperate struggle.
They fought as bravely and -as determinedly
as Newfoundlanders have always fought down
through the ages, and they were in the ranks
still playing their part nobly when peace and
victory came.

There is a land in the west and north
Whither the bravest men went forth,
And daunted not by fog nor ice,
They reached at last a paradise.
A land to be won by those who durst,
No wonder the British chose it first,
And they named it Newfoundland at sight;
It's rather the Land of Heart's Delight.

Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. H. Dennis: Honourable senators,
during yesterday's session I asked members
on both sides of this chamber if they were
satisfied with the newspaper coverage of the
proceedings of the Senate and its various
committees. I was assured by the government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), a fellow
Nova Scotian and a life-long friend, that this
vital matter would receive attention at today's
sitting of the Senate.
I brought this matter to the attention of
the house yesterday because I had learned
from various senators who have been in this
honourable house for many years, that their
names had never been mentioned by newspapers in their own constituencies. I was
happy to be informed by the leader and his
deputy (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that this matter
would be examined into and dealt with
immediately.
In speaking today, after an unavoidable
absence, I wish to call attention to the unfortunate situation which is developing in the
Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland-the
tenth province in confederation-because of
the partial loss of world markets.
The famous apple industry of the Annapolis Valley is in a serious plight, and orchardists there are being paid to tear up their
trees. Because of heavy importations of coal
from the United States by our railways and
other industries, the Canadian market for our
coal has been gravely threatened, and in
some cases in the past miners have been laid
off and soup kitchens set up to feed them.
One of the heaviest blows to the port of
Halifax and the rest of Nova Scotia has been
the loss of our valuable and important
market in the West Indies, to which a great
deal of our fish and other products were
formerly exported. Today, ships are lying
idle in our magnificent harbours from which,
in wartime, thousands of Canadian soldiers,
airmen and naval personnel embarked to play
their part in saving the empire.
The chief farm crop of Prince Edward
Island, the cradle of confederation, is potatoes.
Producers there are faced with large potato
surpluses in both the United States and
Canada, and this is a very serious situation
for the island people, the majority of whom
are engaged in agriculture.

SENATE

The total collapse of the pit-prop market,
to which the honourable senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) and other
maritime senators have called attention, is a
real calamity for New Brunswick, where this
is a major industry, and, to a lesser extent,
for Nova Scotia. Loss of lumber markets
overseas have had a general crippling effect
on the economy of the maritimes.
Newfoundland, so I am informed, is today
extremely concerned over the loss of markets
for fish in the West Indies, Britain and elsewhere, and one of its pulp mills has been
obliged to shut down.
Fortunately, Nova Scotia still has in successful operation its modern newsprint mill, on the
Mersey river at Liverpool, headed by a Nova
Scotian, I. W. Killam, of Yarmouth; and our
oldest and most substantial industries-Moir's,
Stanfield's, Lewis' and W. H. Schwartz and
Sons of Halifax-are still flourishing.
My first humble effort as a member of this
honourable body, nearly twenty years ago,
was to head a tourist committee, which is now
a permanent feature of the Senate and is
carrying on under the able chairmanship of
my old and distinguished friend, the senator
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan), a member of the Fourth Estate, which as Burke once
remarked is "the highest of them all." The
Canadian Travel Bureau, bas from its incepLion been in the capable hands of a Maritimer,
Mr. D. Leo Dolan, who is well known to this
honourable body. The tourist industry has
had a remarkable success and has brought in
millions of rnuch-needed American dollars.
At the time of my appointment to this chamber, it was with reluctance that I accepted the
great honour, as I felt there were many others
in my province who were more worthy to be
selected. However, I am glad to have this
opportunity to make very clear the position I
have always taken, regardless of politics.
In the first place, I come from a great
British naval and military base, where, as the
Right Honourable Stanley Baldwin once
observed during a visit to Halifax, the Union
Jack had never.been lowered in 200 years.
Nor am I one who would wish to be associated,
in politics or elsewhere, with any group whoto quote another famous English Prime Minis-

ter, the Right Honourable Winston Churchill
-would wish to "preside over the liquidation
of the British Empire."
The Maritime Provinces, once the richest and
most progressive part of this dominion, with
the highest marine tonnage in the world, still
possess all the physical attributes, including
their people, which have made them great.
Along with Newfoundland, they possess the
advantage of the ocean at their door, with
cheap water-borne freights to carry their
products to the four corners of the earth.
They have an abundance of coal, with iron ore
and steel, which should make then rivals of
the great American steel centres like Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
Honourable senators, I am a newspaper
man. I joined the staff of the Halifax Herald
in 1900 as a printer's devil and am noww'ith the generous toleration of the banksone of the owners of two daily newspapers
published in Halifax, with a net paid circulation of more than 100,000. It is my earnest
desire to conduct these newspapers in a free,
frank and fearless manner, for the benefit of
the Maritime Provinces, Newfoundland and
the rest of the Dominion of Canada, from St.
John's, Yarmouth and Sydney to Vancouver
and Victoria.
I know that I am living on borrowed time;
and I am here today against the orders of
my doctors. But if it is the last speech I make
here, I wish to inform the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), and honourable members, on both sides of the chamber that I will never be a "Charlie
McCarthy"Some Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Dennis: -though I rather hesitate
to mention McCarthy, since he is made of

wood, and I have no wish to be the means
of starting another government prosecution
such as the one now proposed in connection
with the manufacture of wooden matches in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien moved the adjournment
of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, March

The above articles shall not be deemed to abridge

Kinley, Petten, Reid, Roebuck, Ross, Turgeon,
Vaillancourt and Wood.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, before the matter proceeds further I would ask
that my name be dropped from the list of
those composing the committee. I am a
member of so many committees now that
I could not possibly attend the meetings of
this one.

MARCH 20, 1950
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it the pleasure of
the honourable the mover (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
that the name of the Honourable Senator
Haig be withdrawn from his motion?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is not with pleasure
that I withdraw it, but quite the reverse. I
had hoped that the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) would be a member of the
committee, but I fully appreciate the difficulties under which he works and the very many
calls on his time so, with regret, I withdraw
his name.
Honourable senators will recall that in the
closing hours of the last session of parliament I withdrew my resolution on human
rights and fundamental freedoms on the
expressed understanding that I would introduce it in somewhat different form at the next
session.
The Hon. the Speaker: Will the honourable
gentleman excuse me? My attention bas been
called to Rule 31, which reads:
A motion or amendment not seconded cannot be
debated or put from the Chair.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I overlooked naming
the seconder.
The honourable gentleman
from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley)
seconds the motion.
The resolution of last year was debated
throughout the session, and a good many
masterly addresses were delivered by my
colleagues,
addresses
containing
noble
thoughts expressed in the most exalted
language. That resolution proposed a reference of the subject of human rights to the
then forthcoming dominion-provincial conference. Some honourable senators questioned the advisability of such procedure,
though we appear to be unanimous in our
view that human beings, irrespective of race,
colour or creed, have rights which should
be respected, fundamental freedoms which
should be preserved. Basically, we in this
house are all for equality and freedom-at
least in theory. What "buts" will appear
when we proceed to put these lofty principles
into practice is another matter. At the conclusion of the last session of parliament we
had not progressed that far. So it was with
this happy unanimity in mind that I drew the
resolution which now appears on the order
paper.
Honourable senators will observe that the
resolution does not make any reference to
the dominion-provincial conference, which
I presume will take place this fall, or indeed
any direct suggestion as to amending the
Canadian constitution. What I ask is that a
committee of this house consider and report
on the subject of human rights and fundamental freedoms, what they are and how

they may be protected and preserved. I ask
that the committee consider what steps may
be taken to assure such rights to all persons
in Canada. This leaves the committee free to
advise such steps as seem wise under all
the circumstances. I have set out in the
resolution, as I did last session, a number
of articles based upon the United Nations
declaration adopted at Lake Success, which
I assume will form the basis for the discussion
of the committee.
I of course fully realize that honourable
senators, and many people outside this chamber, may wonder why I take so keen an
interest in this subject. If I may be permitted, I shall endeavour to tell you the reason
for my interest. I am a liberal. The first
principle of liberalism in respect for the
rights of the individual. The dangers which
the world is facing today flow from two
opposite sources: privilege, as promoted by
those on the right, and socialistic worship of
the state to the utter disregard of the rights
of the individual, as promoted by those on
the left. Old-time tory privilege, with its
assumptions of superiority by some over the
mass of mankind, with its landlordism, its
claim to ownership of the gifts of nature, its
denial of equality, both economical and political, is bad enough, God knows; but I doubt
whether this side of the story is as bad as
the other side. This attitude of privilege bas
cursed the world with tyranny, oppression,
untold poverty, cruelty, and woe, but the
modern idolatry of the worship of the state
may be even worse. The Nazi philosophy,
which knows not of either mine or thine, and
would reform the world by giving authority
to those in power to override the natural or
moral rights of all of us, invites a condition
of tyranny such as we saw in Italy under
Mussolini, in Germany under Hitler, and now
see in Russia under Stalin.
I have always deeply regretted the weakness
of the intellectual and reform movement
during my lifetime, which bas resulted largely
from two great wars and several small ones.
Social arrangements are far from ideal, but
apparently the only crusaders of whom we
hear today are the Socialists. Their movement is based upon discontent, engendered by
the injustice which is so manifest in our
economic arrangements. People are prone
to fly from the evils they know to those they
wot not of.
In my opinion, honourable senators, the
most effective reply to the evils of privilege
on the one hand and of socialistic totalitarianism on the other is a respect for individual
rights and freedom. That is fundamental; and
one of my reasons for having moved this
resolution last session and again this year is
to attempt to "keep the ball in the air", to

SENATE

have people continually thinking on this
subject of human rights, of respect for the
individual, and of the importance of maintDining those rights inviolate.
I have no fear of nationalization when it
can be shown to be in the public interest.
We have had a great deal of it in Canada
during my lifetime and yours, without harm
to anyone. But I think that nationalization
should be confined for the most part to such
natural monopolies as railroads and telegraphs and to such public services as schools
and post offices. I have no hesitation in supporting the humanitarian social services
which have grown to be so important in our
time, even though they may seem to tend
in the direction of socialism. It is the attempt
to reduce all industry to national control and
all men to civil servants which I oppose, for
such a system sets at naught the rights of the
individual and is the very negation of freedom. There is a vast difference between
actions which may seem necessary at a particular time to improve conditions which make
for injustice, and a course of proceeding which
is founded on the philosophy of the subservience of the individual to state control.
If we can make vivid in the minds of
Canadian people that every individual, however humble-irrespective of the colour of his
skin, the race from which he springs, the
altar at which he prays, or the language
which he speaks-that by virtue of his
humanity he has rights which cannot and
must not be violated by others, even though
the others be all of us, we will have triumphed
over our would-be oppressors, both the parasites of privilege and the state idolaters at the
collectivest shrine.
I am convinced that the good society is the
just society. The essential of justice is knowledge of and respect for the rights of all mankind-man, woman and child-and not
forgetting, either, our younger brothers of the
animal kingdom.
I have no hesitation in asking my fellow
senators to devote some time to this greatest
of all subjects, human rights and fundamental
freedoms, in the certain faith that no harm
can come frorn such a study and much good
may flow from it.
Honourable senators, I move this resolution, confident that you agree with the general
principles which I have tried to enunciate.
Some Hon. Senaiors: Hear, hear.

The motion was agreed to.

HIS HONOUR THE SPEAKER
FELICITATIONS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, before
the Orders of the Day are proceeded with,
I should like to take this opportunity to
congratulate His Honour the Speaker upon
his return to the Chair. I may say he had a
most worthy substitute in his absence, but we
are all delighted to see our Speaker back
with us.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I concur heartily in the sentiments just
expressed by the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig). We are all glad to welcome
His Honour the Speaker back in his customary
good health.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second
reading of Bill G, an Act to incorporate
Ukrainian National Federation.
He said: Honourable senators, because of its
wide significance I think something should be
said about this bill. This legislation seeks for
the routine incorporation of a company which
has no share capital, whose activities are
carried on without the purpose of gain,
and whose properties are to be used for promoting certain praiseworthy agendas.
The organization to be incorporated has
been carrying on these activities for the past
eighteen years under the name of Ukrainian
National Federation of Canada. During this
period the Federation has earned a highly
commendable reputation for its patriotic service; therefore, while the bill is largely a
matter of routine, the incorporation of the
company is an action which in my humble
opinion is one of significance.
The Ukrainian population of Canada comprises the third largest ethnie group in the
country, the English and the French speaking
groups ranking first and second. At the taking
of the 1941 census there were 305,000 Ukrainian Canadians, but since then the number has
grown considerably, and our Ukrainian population is today estimated at over half a million
people, with 25,000 in the city of Toronto
alone.
I have in my hand a pamphlet entitled
Our Ukrainian Loyalists, written by Watson

Kirkconnell, an eminent authority on new
Canadians and an outspoken anti-communist.
This pamphlet was published during the

MARCH 20, 1950
last Great War, in June 1943, and I should
like to read what the author has to say about
the Ukrainians in Canada.
The bulk of the Ukrainian immigration into
Canada came between 1900 and 1914, and the overwhelming majority of such immigrants came from
the regions of Galicia and Bukovina, rather than

from Russia. In the census returns of 1931, over
70,000 gave their birthplace as in these areas and
only 2,158 gave Russia. Even in 1931, however, over
60 per cent of the Ukrainian Canadians had already
been born on this side of the Atlantic, and the
figure today must be closer to 70 per cent.
These are facts that cannot be stressed too
strongly by those who would understand the
Ukrainian Canadians. At least two-thirds of them
are now Canadian-born, trained in Canadian
schools, and increasingly Canadian in consciousness.
And in ancestral origin, upwards of 95 per cent of
them come from a region that was never part of
Russia, was never regularly subject to the authority

of Moscow, and owes no sentimental loyalty to
Russia, either Tsarist or Soviet.

Those are the remarks of a - well-known
authority on this subject, and one who is said
to be fairly "hipped" on the question of
commuism.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The President of Acadia
University.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Exactly. He speaks
some twenty mid-European languages-I forget exactly how many.
Now, while two-thirds of the Ukrainian
Canadians have been born in Canada, they
were much more predominantly new-Canadians when the depression fell upon this
country in 1930. At the time they had not
been sufficiently long in Canada to be well
enough established here, in either business or

farming to surmount the crop failures and
the very wide unemployment of that disastrous period. In consequence, they suffered
great hardships and privations, particularly
in the West; though, as I remember, a good
many of them also suffered in the great cities
of the East.
I have in my hand a pamphlet entitled
A Program and a Record. It was published
by the Ukrainian National Federation after
a convention in Winnipeg in 1943, under the
presidency of Mr. W. Kossar, one of the
present applicants for incorporation of the
Ukrainian National Federation.
I have
known Mr. Kossar personally for many years,
and I can vouch for both his ability and his
high purpose. I should like to read from this
pamphlet, where he is speaking of the depression which fell upon Canada in the thirties:
Under the conditions of depression, hardship
and suffering, a wide and powerful propaganda was

under way, which, in certain cases, had intensified
the already existing discontent to the point of open
violence, and which was tending to undermine the
fundamental principles governing human behaviour.
In this propaganda which was penetrating market

squares, community halls and even family circles,
the ideals of loyalty to Canada and of personal
duty to one's neighbours were branded as the signs
of social stupidity; cultural traditions, patriotism
and religion were treated as remnants of ancient
superstitions; initiative for personal rehabilitation
was termed as a lack of class consciousness. All this

propaganda, reverberating from the forests of British Columbia, through the prairies of the West to
the mines and industrial plants of the East, produced a growing social ferment which resulted in
general confusion and which was rapidly approaching the danger line of social safety.

Another of the applicants is Mr. William
Hultay, whom also I know intimately. For
many years, until recently, Mr. Hultay was
a druggist in the city of Toronto. He is a
man of education and culture, a Christian, of
broad Canadian principles. He and the other
applicants, all men of good will, decided that
something must be done about the type of
thinking that was spreading among their
Ukrainian compatriots. It was to meet that
challenge that a number of men of Ukrainian
origin held a convention in Winnipeg, and at
that time the federation was organized. Mr.
Hultay was secretary of the convention, and
after the convention he became the federation's first organizer. Mr. Anthony Hlynka,
who was the member for Vegreville in the
House of Commons during the last two parliaments the 19th and 20th parliaments was
Mr. Hultay's secretary, and became the secretary of the Edmonton branch, the first to be
organized. That was in 1932, and the federation continued to expand from that time.
I should like to read a few lines about the
organization itself, written by Professor
Watson Kirkconnell, in his pamphlet to which
I have referred:
Secular rather than ecclesiastical in its background is the Ukrainian National Federation,
fcunded at a conference in Saskatoon in 1932. Its
main nucleus consists of veterans of the Ukrainian
armies that fought against the Red and White
Russian armies, the Poles, and the Rumanians, back
in the unavailing struggle for independence in
1918-20.
They have consequently been violently
anti-communist, as well as anti-Polish, and have
been more interested than the other groups in the
physical possibilities of Ukrainian emancipation in
Europe. In Canada, they have always insisted on
a primary British loyalty, and have from the outset
been closely associated with branches of the Canadian Legion. They have supported the war with
enthusiasm, and in some of their branches every
able-bodied man is now in the active or the reserve
Canadian forces. The membership of the Ukrainian
National Federation is in excess of 19,000. The
federation itself has 74 branches, the Ukrainian
Women's Organization bas 38 branches, the Ukrainion National Youth Federation bas 35 branches, and
the Ukrainian War Veterans'
Association
23
branches, making 170 local units altogether. They
administer 74 community halls, 76 local libraries, 65
schools, 71 choirs, 25 orchestras, 83 dramatic clubs,
18 dancing classes, a national museum, and 14 consumers' co-operatives.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Are they all in one
province?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, they are spread
from one end of this country to the other.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Will the honourable gentleman allow me to ask a question? I am not
criticizing at all, for I am in favour of the
bill. I do not know anything about these
people on the prairies, but I have some
information about them in British Columbia.
Are they not divided into three distinct
groups, of which two are very religious and
one is not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the honourable
gentleman mean the group to which I am
referring?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am speaking of the
Ukrainians in this country.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are several
groups. The group for which I am speaking
is asking for the incorporation of its own
society. It is a highly religious group. Among
the Ukrainians there is a small minority of
irreligious
and communistically inclined
people; but, honourable senators, the Ukrainians are not the only ones who have among
them some people of this type. Though some
of the objectionable ones have been very
noisy, and because of our lack of understanding of their language we have had some
difficulty in drawing distinctions between
them, my own impressions are that the large
majority of these people are highly patriotic,
have good common sense, and are decent
citizens and good Canadians.
I speak from a good many years of experience with Ukrainian people. I have known
these people well, both individually and
collectively. In this pamphlet which they
publish there is a photograph in which I
appear, taken some years ago while I was
attending one of their meetings before the
city hall in Toronto, where a wreath was
laid on the grave of some unknown Ukrainian
soldier.
Originally, the Ukrainians were a pastoral
people. The Ukraine is in some respects
comparable to Canada; its people for generations past have earned their living for the
most part by coaxing the crops from the
subsoil into the sunlight. They are, therefore, not unlike our own Canadian people,
and I humbly submit that they have been,
on the whole, of the best type of immigrants
that have blessed Canada with their presence.
It is because of the broader considerations
of the subject that I am discussing it at some
length. As I have said, the incorporation of
the society is a matter of routine; but the
occasion of the incorporation of the Ukrainian

people in this way bas, to my mind, a very
great significance. May I be permitted to
read a statement of the principles upon which
their growth has taken place? It might be
called a creed, but is perhaps more properly
referred to as a statement of principles which
has been circulated very widely and has been
used for propaganda purposes in the building
of their organizations. The principles are:
1. Belief in our own duties and responsibilities.
2. Belief in Canada.
3. Belief that the necessary measure of social
justice may be achieved through social reforms
without resorting to violence.
4. Belief in the cultural traditions of our people.
5. Belief in the moral principles of Christianity
as embodied in religious teaching and practice.
6. Belief in the freedom of all peoples.
7. Belief in a free Ukraine.

May I be permitted further to read a
worthwhile paragraph from this pamphlet
which has been circulated among the
Ukrainian people? It contains one of the
tenets upon which this tremendous organization bas been built, and is as follows:
Canada was the country of the faith and hope of
our forefathers and fathers, who left their dear
native land because of brutal oppression and ruthless exploitation by foreign occupants. Canada is
the country of our own faith, and we want to
preserve it as a country of faith and hope for our
children. We believe in the country of our free
adoption because it was here that we found the
social and political freedom, equality and opportunity for which the Ukrainian people in Europe
have fought for centuries and for which they are
still fighting. We believe in Canada because, in
this new land, the principles of British democracy
and fair play are practised by the parliament, by
the courts and by the citizens. We believe in Canada, because it offers us and our children its vast
resources and opportunities in the spirit of "fair
play" and trust.

Mr. W. B. Caswell, the solicitor for the
federation for many years, has supplied me
with a brief in this matter. I have discussed
the bill with him, and I found him very well
informed. He tells me that as a result of the
promulgation of its principles, the federation
has grown to the point where it now has
assets valued conservatively at $1,196,000, and

liabilities of only $293,000. This is a wonderful achievement amongst new Canadians. The
property comprises approximately
thirty
cultural centres, called homes or halls, where
the people may speak their native language,
put on plays and present their colourful
dances. The branch in Edmonton owns a
building valued at $65,000. There are also

MARCH 20, 1950
branches at Calgary and Cherhill. At Saskatoon the association's building is valued at
$50,000. Other branches are located at North
Battleford and Prince Albert. The Regina
branch has a building worth $35,000, Hafford
and Marlin also have branches. My honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)
wil be interested to know that the federation
have a building in his home city valued at
$240,000. At St. Boniface and Fort William
their buildings are worth $45,000 and $60,000
respectively. Branches are also to be found
at Port Arthur and Geraldton. A $25,000
building is located in Sudbury. Espanola,
Kirkland Lake and Timmins also have
branches. In Toronto a building is now under
construction, to be opened next month, worth
$340,000. There is now a building in West
Toronto worth $35,000. During the recent
election campaign I spoke in their building
at Oshawa, which is worth some $35,000. St.
Catharines has a building valued at $40,000;
Hamilton, $40,000; Windsor, $75,000; Montreal,
$85,000. There are also branches at Point
Pelee, Val D'Or and Rouyn.
Mr. Caswell tells me that in 1939 the
Ukrainian National Federation of Canada went
all out in its support of Canada's war effort,
and that it had the highest proportion of
enlistments per capita of any ethnic group in
Canada. Approximately 35,000 young men
and women of Ukrainian origin joined various branches of the Canadian forces. I have
in my hand a pamphlet entitled "Seven
Presidents in Uniform". It tells the story of
the Toronto Branch of the Ukrainian National
Youth Federation. One after the other, seven
presidents of that organization entered the
Canadian Army and served in His Majesty's
Forces during the last war. That is a record
of which any organization may be proud.
Walter Tucker, leader of the Liberal party
in the province of Saskatchewan, in writing
to ask me to interest myself in this matteralthough I needed no urging, for I am
intensely interested in new Cariadians-says:
I think you will find, if you check on the organization with the Secretary of State's Department,
that it is a loyal group of people who have consistently supported our country, particularly against
the communists.

I adopted his suggestion and wrote to the
Secretary of State. The reply, written by
Mr. V. J. Kaye for Mr. Frank Foulds, Director
of the Canadian Citizenship Branch, is as
follows:
Many thanks for your letter of December 17 concerning the Ukrainian National Federation.
We
have known Mr. Kossar for a number of years and
have dealt with him both as the President of the
Ukrainian National Federation (a dominion-wide
organization) and as Vice-President of the over-all
Ukrainian Canadian Committee, Winnipeg, Manitoba. A great many members of the federation

served with the Canadian armed forces during the
last war, and I understand that Mr. Kossar is a
Reserve Army man.
During our wartime association we found Mr.
Kossar to be very co-operative, and the Ukrainian
National Federation participated in all wartime
activities. After the war the federation conducted
language classes for newcomers and also Canadian
citizenship classes during the summer months.

In its political outlook the federation is strongly

anti-Communist; In Ukrainian matters, nationalistic.
We do not see any reason why the Ukrainian
National Federation should not be incorporated.
Should you need more information as to the
federation, please let us know and we shall be
glad to be of assistance to you.

I do not know what organization could be
given a better recommendation on the facts
than the Canadian National Ukrainian Federation. It bas served Canada wel among
people whom it can and we cannot reach. I
have the greatest of pleasure in asking my
fellow citizens to give this bill second reading; and I do so with a whole-hearted
admiration for these people.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
intend to make only a few remarks. I do not
believe there is anyone in this chamber or
in Canada who knows these people better
than I do. For some forty years I have lived
among them, done business with them, sat
on councils with them. However, there is
one thought I have expressed to them when
they were engaged in promoting various
organizations of their own. It is this: "Why
do you build separate halls? Let us all be
together; let us all meet together. If I am
excluded, I am missing something". That is
a thought which occurs to me when we are
asked to grant charters to special groups: we
lose something when they keep to themselves.
But so far as these good people are concerned
I have no word of complaint, and I am not
going to oppose the bill.
Let me point out here that the government,
by seizing the halls of another Ukrainian
group, made Communists out of many Ukrainians. This was one of the government's bigger
blunders. Not content with locking their
halls and leaving them unoccupied, they
decided to seize and dispose of them for a
fraction of what they were worth. Many
Ukrainians turned in disgust against the
government because of this action.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Was it the government
or was it the Mounted Police that seized
them?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No; the government
seized them, and the government sold them,
for far less than they were worth. The
Mounted Police had no power to sell them.
It seems to me that in this respect our
Ukrainian fellow-citizens failed to receive the
"human rights" to which they are entitled.

SENATE
I want also to say a word with regard to
Mr. Hlynka, the former member of parliament for Vegreville. At the federal election
of 1945, in which he was returned, a Communist ran against him and received nearly 4,000
votes. Because of Mr. Hlynka's fine work in
Edmonton and all . over the country in
opposition to Communism, these people
decided not to put forward a candidate last
year, but to vote Liberal in order to defeat
him, and this they succeeded in doing.
Government supporters may take what satisfaction they can from the fact that Communists helped to elect the Liberal in Vegreville.
I was in the district afterwards and, knowing
what a fine fellow had been defeated, tried
to find out the reason. This is the explanation
I got.
Hon. John T. Haig: The honourable senator
from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
referred to Manitoba. I believe the proportion of Ukrainians to the total population is
larger in Manitoba than in any other province. Honourable members may be interested
in knowing that today, of fifty-seven members of the Manitoba legislature, five are
Ukrainians, two of whom were born in the
Ukraine and the other three in Manitoba. The
father of the present member for Ethelbert
sat for many years as a representative of that
riding. The son is university-trained and a
graduate in law. The provincial constituency
of Fisher is represented by a well-educated
native of the Ukraine, who has been the sitting member continuously since 1922, and is
The member for
now deputy speaker.
Winnipeg North, one of our new ridings, is a
Canadian-born Ukrainian. The member for
Springfield-a Ukrainian-is sitting for his
second term, although he was defeated for
the last legislature; and the member for
Emerson, Manitoba-born and educated, is
also in his second legislative term.
I had the pleasure and the honour of sitting for one or two terms with a Winnipeg
lawyer who was born in the Ukraine but who
came here as a small boy with his parents.
On one occasion legislation came before the
house which had for its object the provision
of medical degrees for certain persons with
insufficient medical training. This member,
who up to that time had been quite reserved,
fiared up and fought the bill bitterly both in
the house and in committee, and largely
through his efforts the committee refused to
recommend it. I did not understand why he
opposed the bill so strongly, and told him so.
He *replied addressing me by my surname,
"Haig, our people do not know the good
doctors ffrom the quacks, and they believe that
if the standards are lowered they may get
incompetent men. You people know them

better and can choose better who should be
selected". And he stuck to his guns right
through.
My honourable friend from Toronto Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) mentioned the war efforts
of our Ukrainians. I would point out that
the only man from Manitoba to win the
Victoria Cross during the last war was a
Ukrainian born in Winnipeg. I am sure all
honourable senators know his record. He
was in a burning aircraft, and although he
had plenty of time to leap to safety he went

heroic efforts his comrade was enabled to
escape, but he lost his life when the plane
crashed.
Like my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), I have known these
Ukrainian people since 1904. What I say now
may be a little personal, but it clearly indicates what kind of people these Ukrainians
are. When walking down the east side of
Main street in Winnipeg on a fine spring day
in 1904, I was met by a group of five
Ukrainians. One of them came up to me and
showed me a card bearing the name of a wellknown local firm of lawyers, and asked me if
I could direct him and his friends to this
place. I told him it was just two blocks down
the street and, having lots of time, I went
along to show him the way. When I left these
men their spokesman asked me what my name
was, and I wrote my name and business
address on the back of the card he was carrying. Two weeks later he came into the law
office where I was employed as a student and
told me that be and his friends wanted to buy
a certain 240-acre parcel of land. When I
told him we did not sell land, he asked me to
find out who was selling this particular
property. So I went to the Land and Titles
Office and found out who was the owner of
this land. Then J went to him and asked
what his price was, and he replied, "$10 an
acre". I then asked him what commission he
would allow, and he said 50 cents an acre, and
told me that I had to be back in a week's time
with a certain amount of cash, and so on.
Well, I reported to the Ukrainian group what
the terms were. Two days later the owner of
the land called me up and asked, "Are you the
young man who was talking to me the other
day about my land"? When I said yes, he told
me, "Well, I have changed my mind. The
price is $10 net." So I went to my Ukrainian
friends and told them, "Gentlemen, the owner
has raised his price ta $10 net per acre. That
means it will cost you $10.50 per acre." To
make a long story short, they said that these
terms would be all right and that they would
buy the land at that price, which they did.
Those were Ukrainian immigrants who settled

MARCH 20, 1950
in Manitoba, and my office today is doing
business now for their children. They have
probated the wills of most of those five men
who bought the 240 acres in 1904.
I have related this story because so many
Canadians feel that there is a certain element
of the Ukrainians in Canada who are communistic in their outlook. I do not know
exactly what would be the proportion of
communistic sympathisers in my province, but
it would be somewhere between 5 and 10 per
cent. These people are bitterly communistic,
but just as bitterly anti-communistic is the
element which my honourable friend and I
have been talking about. We have had these
new Canadians, displaced persons, come to our
city, and they know what Communism is and
what it means. Several times they have gone
to meetings thinking 'that they were going
to have the pleasure of hearing speakers in
their own language; but it turned out that the
speakers were getting up and talking about
what the Communists were doing in the world.
These new Canadians, knowing what Communism is, contradicted the speakers, and
naturally a riot took place.
It is my understanding that one-third of
these Ukrainians belong to the Greek Catholic
Church, one-third to the Roman Catholic
Church and the remainder to the various
Protestant denominations.
Let me relate another story to indicate just
how well these Ukrainian people may be
.assimilated into our population. During the
recent federal election campaign I spoke on
behalf of a friend of mine at a certain meeting, and when it was over and we were driving along he said to me: "Jack, we are pretty
near my home. It is only forty miles away
and I want to take you there for a visit."
I accepted his invitation. My friend was an
Englishman of about fifty-three years of age,
and had come out to Canada with his father
when he was only four or five years old. He
was married to a fine woman, a graduate
nurse and former assistant superintendent of
the Winnipeg General Hospital. Well, shortly
.after we got to his home his daughter came
in and served tea and biscuits, and the mother
introduced us, mentioning a Ukrainian name
in doing so. Presently the daughter's husband
came* in, a young chap who had recently
graduated from the University of Manitoba as
a civil engineer. He had been born in Canada
of Ukrainian parents. I thought to myself,
"Now, there is a challenge to Canada. Who
says we cannot assimilate people from another
.country?" I have mentioned this incident
because it illustrates the sort of thing that is
taking place in my province.
I have visited the Ukrainian settlements in
ýhe northern parts of our province, and many

of their young men and women are graduates
of our colleges and universities and are taking
their places in the community as lawyers,
doctors and'so on. For instance, two of the
members of the Winnipeg School Board were
born in our city of Ukrainian parents and
were graduated from the University of
Manitoba.
Honourable senators, there can be no better
immigrants than the Ukrainians, and so I
heartily support this bill. The leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and I were
together at the United Nations meeting in
New York a few years ago, and he will
remember as well as I do how bitterly communistic was the Ukrainian representative.
But I am delighted that our Ukrainian people
are being encouraged by our parliament
because they are the best fighters we have in
our campaign against Communism in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
wish to say a few words in support of this
bill. Its purpose has been clearly explained
by the honourable senator from Toronto
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). The Ukrainian
Federation is not a business organization but
a cultural organization, whose purpose is to
enable an important element in our population to retain for succeeding generations a
knowledge of their culture and their history.
Some of the great musicians, poets, writers
and dramatists of Europe were of the Ukrainian race, and it is this record which these
people desire to perpetuate in this country.
Their love and 'capacity for music is generally
known across this whole dominion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Several of their artists
and musicians have become quite eminent,
and these people will continue to make a
worthy contribution towards the enrichment
of our Canadian culture.
I have had a good working knowledge of
the Ukrainian people for the last fifty years.
I recall that when their early settlers came
to Western Canada toward the end of the last
century, they arrived in their sheepskin coats
and were the objects of much curiosity among
the Canadian people. As the leader opposite
knows, they went into the rough bush country of Manitoba. But when you go into that
land today you will find good farms, homes
and schools. The Ukrainians have a deep love
for education, and, as the honourable senator
from Toronto Trinity bas pointed out, their
contribution is outstanding. It is remarkable
that only fifty years ago the first Ukrainians
settled in this country, and yet within forty

SENATE
years, a new generation was able to contribute over 35,000 members to the armed
forces of Canada. That in itself, honourable
senators, is a great contribution.
1 have not the slightest hesitation in supporting this bill. It will be to our credit to
pass the bill and to incorporate the Ukrainian National Federation. These people are
intense Canadians. They love this country
for its freedom, for its laws, and also for the
opportunities it has given to them and will
continue to give them and their children.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

DISTRIBUTION OF BILLS
INQUIRY
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Leger: Honourable senators, before
the Orders of the Day are proceeded with I
wish to refer to order No. 2, for the second
reading of Bill I, an Act to amend the Criminal
Code. Amendments to the Criminal Code are
usually important and it would appear that
those in this bill are no exception. The bill
contains seven pages, and although it is on
my file today it was not there yesterday. Consequently, I have had no chance to study the
measure. Prior to this session the custom
used to be to place copies of bills in our mail
box in advance of their introduction in the
Senate, so that we might have an opportunity
to look at them, but so far as I am aware
that is not now being done. I simply want to
call the attention of the leader of the government to this situation, and ask if it cannot be
remedied.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, the question raised by my honourable
friend is an important one. It is important
that all honourable senators be supplied with
all bills that we are to deal with before they
are explained, but it is particularly important
in the case of my honourable friend from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) for no other member of this honourable house reads the legislation as carefully as he does.
I am advised that this bill was distributed
yesterday. My honourable friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) is prepared to explain the
bill today, but if the honourable gentleman
from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) prefers that
it stand, I am sure my honourable friend from
Toronto will concur. As an alternative I
would suggest, subject to what the honourable
gentleman from L'Acadie may say, that the
bill be explained today, and that then, if no
discussion on it, the Whip (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
be asked to adjourn the debate, so that anyone
who wishes to speak on the bill may do so
later. I am in the hands of the Senate in
this respect.
Hon. Mr. Leger: I am quite willing that
the explanation be given now.

THE SENATE
NEWSPAPER COVERAGE
Hon. Donald A. MacLennan: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with I wish to call the attention of
the Senate to an article which appeared in
this morning's Citizen.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Apparently the writer
of this article thinks that the work of the
Senate, no matter how important it may be,
does not make news and he intimates that
the Senate is on the way out.
I have heard many members of the other
place make facetious remarks about the
Senate, and after looking them over carefully
I have come to the conclusion that these
members never hope to get into the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Moreover, they are
incapable of making speeches worth listening
to. Any speeches that I have heard in the
other house concerning the activities of the
Senate were as insipid and as colourless as
saltless porridge.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The writer of this
article gives a little clue as to the manner
in which the Senate could get into the news.
He points out that because the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) attacked someone
or other he received "a considerable measure
of publicity". I suppose that means that the
way to get one's name in the paper is to attack
someone.
This newspaper gives a further clue, and
a valuable one, as to what is news. On its
front page there appears this headline:
"Minnie The Cat Adopts Mouse." That is
news! Minnie the cat can get into the news,
but the work of the Senate cannot. The
article says, among other things:
The Senate has ceased to be news. The hard fact
of the newspaper business is that the papers must
publish news, and the Senate does not qualify.

I presume "Minnie the Cat" does qualify.
The article goes on to say that the speeches
in the Senate are not of a high order:
The quality of debate in the Senate is by no
means outstanding, but the subject matter has
usually been so threshed over, several times, in the
House of Commons that there are few grains of
interesting news left by the time the Senate gets
to it.

I do not regard myself as a judge, but in
the estimation of those whom I do regard
as judges, the speeches made in the Senate
last session, and so far this year, have been
most excellent. A few days ago we heard
an outstanding speech from the honourable
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David).

which did this work were four electric locomotives whose power was supplied by the

the railway was operated under the supervision of that corporation. The cost of the
switching was borne entirely by the Canadian

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: There are 3,000 shares,
and they are owned by the Shawinigan Water
and Power Company. The total capital is
$300,000, and the shares are to be sold to the
two companies for $125,000.
Hon. Mr. Leger: At par?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No, below par, and this
will include engines, right-of-way, sheds and
so on, as well as a four-and-a-half mile length
of electric superstructure.

MARCH 21, 1950
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I presume the Shawinigan
Water and Power Company, as the principal
freight consignor or shipper at that point,
would in the final analysis pay the switching
charges, either directly or indirectly.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Once the railway
belongs to the CNR and the CPR, the Shawinigan Water and Power Company will not
have anything to do with it.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: They will still pay for the
switching, will they not? Somebody has to
pay for the switching.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Each company will pay
for its own switching.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Yes, but the shipper ultimately pays for it.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes, but the amount of
money paid by an industry to ship a car from
Shawinigan Falls, let us say, to Montreal,
is not any more or any less because the
switching operation is done by one company
or the other. If the Canadian National and
the Canadian Pacific can do the switching
at a lower cost, it will be for their own
benefit.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Will they pass on that
lower cost to the shipper? That is my point.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I think there is a tariff.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: But do you anticipate that
the tariff will be varied downward as a
result of this purchase, or will the tariff
remain the same, notwithstanding the reduction in the cost of switching?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I could not tell you that
I think that will depend upon the existing
contract between the different shippers and
the railway. It may be that if the switching
is done at a lower cost the operation will cost
the shipper less.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: The saving may be passed
on?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
I am not opposed to this bill, for I think the
Canadian Pacific Railway should be allowed
to make any investments that it desiresI am sure it knows its own business-but I
think certain stipulations should be made
when money is taken out of the railway
treasury for outside investments. The company's annual statement for 1948 shows
receipts of $27 million in "other income
account." I understand that in the recent
application to the Board of Transport Commissioners for increased freight rates the
company contended that its earnings from
outside investments should not be regarded
as earnings of the railway proper, or as

part of the picture presented by the railway
to show that it was unable to pay its overhead and dividends. In other words, it was
contended that these outside earnings are
deductible from the railway's total. This
procedure, of course, aids the railway in its
plea of insufficient income, and increases its
chances of obtaining higher freight rates.
It is my opinion that an outside investment
which goes sour adversely affects the railway earnings proper, but an investment that
turns out well may have little or no effect
upon the amount of railway earnings available
to keep down rates, for under the company's
system of bookkeeping the earnings from
outside investments are often not included
as real railway earnings. The funds taken
out of the railway treasury for investment
are generally accumulated railway earnings.
Therefore it seems to me that the earnings
on such investments should go back into the
treasury to augment the regular earnings
and help to keep down rates.
It appears that the railways, before they
can make these outside investments, must
obtain permission from parliament; and it
seems to me only reasonable-in saying this
I have in mind not only this bill, but any
such bill-that parliament, before giving its
consent should safeguard the public interest
by prescribing that any earnings derived
from moneys taken out of the railway
treasury for investment outside the railway
proper, shall be returned to the treasury in
order to augment the regular railway earnings. Had such a procedure been followed
in the past it would, I think, have contributed
very considerably towards keeping railway
rates lower than the level they are at today.
I understand that the railways control the
Toronto terminals, which have a bond issue,
and that part or the whole of this issue is
owned by the railways.
Now, although
rentals paid for the terminals are a charge
against railway earnings, the bond interest
received by the railways is placed in "other
income account," apart from regular railway
earnings.
I am not against this investment by the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company in the
Shawinigan Falls terminal railway. As I
stated, I presume the Canadian Pacifie
Railway knows its own business, but I think
certain stipulations must be made with
regard to the earnings on investments made
with moneys taken out of the railway treasury. Such moneys could easily be used for
purposes that would bring in a return or
substantially reduce the overhead of the company. For instance, they could be used to
redeem its 4 per cent debenture stock or
other funded debt. The redemption would

SENATE

cut down the company's overhead, and in
this way effect a saving that could well
be made use of to help bring about some
reduction in rates. A rate of 4 per cent
might have been all right twenty-five years
ago, but it is a rather high rate for a great
corporation with good credit to be paying
today.
I have already pointed out that the Canadian Pacific Railway's annual statement for
1948 shows that there was placed in "other
income account," apart from railway operations, an amount of $27 million. One can
clearly see that if this large sum had been
available to augment the earnings from the
railway proper, the Board of Transport
Commissioners would have had placed before
them a financial statement much more favourable to the public than the statement that was
presented.
The public are anxious to see rates kept at
a level that will stimulate rather than strangle
industry. In the Maritimes, freight rates have
not only gone through the roof, but have
nearly hit the sky, and owing to our geographical position these high rates are seriously hurting our industries. Every senator
from the Maritimes and the West knows how
industry is being handicapped by high rates.
Anything we can do to bring about a reduction in rates should be done. We have to
keep close watch on our transportation companies and check up carefully on the excuses
they put forward for raising rates. This socalled "other income account" into which the
Canadian Pacific Railway puts so much of its
earnings seems to me to be part of a scheme
whereby profits are passed along to the railway's shareholders without being classed as
regular railway earnings. Most of the shares
are held abroad and are not taxed, as are
securities held in Canada. Therefore, the people of Canada lose by having to pay higher
freight rates, and lose again by receiving less
taxes. For the railway it seems to be a case
of "heads I win, tails you lose."
My question is this: If this investment in
the Shawinigan Falls Terminal Railway is
profitable, will the profit or earnings augment
the Canadian Pacific's regular railway earnings and be treated as such when railway
rates are under consideration or, will they
be deducted from the total of the railway's
regular earnings and be considered as "other
income"?
Take the case of the Canadian National
Railways. According to recent proposals they
are now trying, and rightly so, to get themselves on a sound economic basis, where their
earnings will be a refiection of the actual
money invested in the lines since the company
was formed and of the true value of the assets

taken over. In other words, it is proposed to
wipe off the deadwood for which the company
is not responsible. Only in this way will it
become possible to ascertain what are the true
earnings or losses of the Canadian National
Railways.
I think the Canadian Pacifie Railway's
earnings-I mean the earnings on which
freight rates are based-should be a true
reflection of the money invested by shareholders in payment for shares, plus the
accumulated profits thereon, and also of other
valuable considerations handed over by the
government, in the form of lands, subsidies,
etc. In my opinion these considerations were
given, not for the purpose of swelling the
railway's "other income account," but to help
the company to carry on by charging fair and
equitable rates to all parts of the country, so
that commodities would flow freely to markets
from the outskirts of Canada as well as from
the central parts.
I repeat that I am not against this bill at
all. But we have to consider a principle that
is involved, namely, whether a railway should
be permitted to take money from accumulated
railway profits and invest it on the understanding that the return from the investment
will not be included in the regular earnings
upon which freight rates are based. In other
words, should we permit a railway to keep
its accounts in such a way that a proper picture cannot be presented to the Board of
Transport Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would like to ask the
honourable gentleman a question. If the
railway made a bad investment in something
outside the regular railway service and lost a
lot of money, would he say the railway
should be permitted to raise its freight rates
in order to compensate for that loss?
Hon. Mr. McLean: I do not see any other
way in which the railway can charge up an
investment that does go sour. The only
money the railway has is in its treasury, and
that is an accumulation of profits. It seems to
me that is the only thing to which the railway
could charge the loss.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then you say that the
system of accounting now used by the Canadian Pacific Railway is wrong, and that if in
future the railway makes a loss on any outside
investment that loss should be refiected in
increased rates for the transportation of general merchandise? Is that your argument?
Hon. Mr. McLean: I do not sec any other
answer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let my honourable friend
answer the question.

MARCH 21, 1950
Hon. Mr. McLean: The profits should be
reflected there, and if there are investments
which the railway thinks should be included
with the railway business, I do not see any
other place to charge them. It seems to me
that everything the railway has gone into
was started out of railway earnings.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then does my friend maintain that the basis on which the Board of
Transport Commissioners made their findings
was wrong? Their attitude was that the loss
of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the Soo
Line, for instance, should have been charged
in such a way as to increase freight rates in
western Canada. Does my friend support
that position?
Hon. Mr. McLean: I do not know what these
losses were charged against. I do not know
anything else to which they could be charged.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the Board of Transport
Commissioners would not let the railway
charge these losses against railway business
in reaching a basis for fixing the rates. The
policy of the commissioners is that outside
investments should not be taken into consideration in fixing the rates. In that respect
I think the board is right. I do not think that
railway companies should be allowed to
charge their losses in other enterprises to
anything that has to do with railway operations. On the other hand, when profits are
made in other enterprises, the cost of investments should not be included in the cost of
operation of the railway. The railways maintain that they should have a reasonable dividend return on money actually invested in
the road; and if $20 million is invested in
smelters, that amount should not be considered in the fixing of the rates.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: But where did the $20
million come from?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Out of the profits of the
railway.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If profits are made from
investments of the railway, why should they
not go back to the original source?
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the Board of Transport Commissioners does not agree with that
principle, and I support that view.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Is my friend overlooking the
fact that the capital used to purchase these
other enterprises originally came out of
freight earnings of the railways?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was capital invested in
the railways.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Would not these losses, to
which the honourable gentleman refers, be
first charged to "other income", and only be
charged back to the railway operations
revenue when there was an over-all loss. Is
that not the effect of the decision of the board?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I suggest that is the effect
of the decision.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The original capital of the
company was so much. The contention of the
railway now is that after the interest on
bonds, preferred stock and other charges is
paid, the actual capital investment of the
company should show some earnings. If I had
some capital invested in the C.P.R.-which I
have not-why should not that money bring
me some return? Suppose I paid $25 a share
for the stock, should I not have some income
on that investment? Surely that is the principle underlying private ownership. If my
friends do not admit that principle, then they
are only talking socialism. The basis of the
system of capitalism is that the investor is
entitled to a certain return on his mçney. If
the railway takes my money and invests it
profitably in smelters, in fixing freight rates,
it does not charge interest on that capital
investment; yet I as a shareholder participate in the profits. But if the railway gets
involved in a losing proposition, like the Soo
Line, which everyone knows has been on the
verge of bankruptcy for years-

Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it did not. The Board of
Transport Commissioners has decided that
profits from outside investments-or losses,
when they occur-cannot be included in the
general picture. I think the commissioners
are right in this view. I would not want to
vote to bring all the dealings of the railway
into the picture. The railways in the United
States-and I presume in Canada-have
invested heavily in coal mines, because coal
is necessary for the operation of the railways.
Hon. Mr. McLean: But that is an investLarge sums of money have been lost in such ment outside of Canada.

Hon. Mr. Haig: The same thing happened
Hon. Mr. Euler: Do the losses not come out to their investments in the coal mines in

a lot of money. Take for instance the
55950-9

SENATE
Columbia Railway-I do not know where it
runs; I do know, however, that I was one of
the investors in the bonds of that railway and
I lost my shirt. The railway company lost
money there, but it was not allowed to
increase freight rate to make up that loss.
That is my whole point. If the house decides
that the railways and all their subsidiary
enterprises, with profits and losses, should go
into the common pot, that is a proposition to
which I do not subscribe. I have listened
to a good deal of argument, and have read
in the press many times of the refusal of the
Canadian Pacific Railway to include profits
from smelters in the over-all picture of railway operations for the purposes of rate fixing. Take for instance the railway hotels.
Did the Canadian National Railways make
money out of their investment in hotels?
They were all built after 1921, and except
for the Chateau Laurier, in Ottawa, none of
them made any money.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The Nova Scotian is
making money.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is just in the last few
years, but not on the capital invested.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I would disagree with
my friend.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For years none of the
Canadian National Hotels, except the Chateau
Laurier, have balanced their budgets, let
alone paid interest on the capital invested.
The Canadian Pacific Railway has not made
any money out of hotels. In those circumstances has that company any right to charge
its hotel losses against railway operations? I
say "No".
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, do they not
charge it against railway?
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: They do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They do, but the Board of
Transport Commissioners does not allow those
losses to be taken into consideration in fixing
the rates. There is no doubt that they are
excluded. I am in favour of that policy,
because I do not believe the railways should
be in all sorts of business, and that my freight
rates should be affected by the profits or
losses in those investments.
I am in favour of the bill. My honourable
friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
made out a reasonable case. I do not think
either the Canadian National Railways or the
Canadian Pacific Railway will go broke
through the payment of $62,500 each, and I
do not think the Shawinigan Falls Terminal
Railway Company will lose anything-certainly nothing like the sum that was lost on
the Columbia Railway.

Hon. Mr. Fogo: Does my friend not think
the railway should pass along the savings to
the shipper?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They will do so.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: That is all we want to know.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will tell my honourable
friend from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) of the
problem the West faces. The difficulty is
that Quebec and Ontario, which enjoy the
benefits of water navigation transport have an
advantage over us that makes it impossible
for us to compete. We are at a geographical
disadvantage, and I do not see how we can
overcome it.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: If the railways want to
overcome it, can they not do so?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I suggest that they can.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have lived only in the
province of Manitoba, but I am quite familiar
with the problems of that area. I can remember a time when the Canadian Pacific ran
a line from the city of Winnipeg to Winnipeg
Beach, a distance of 47 miles, and it was the
best paying 47 miles on the railway. Then in
time the buses came along, and today it is
one of the poorest paying portions of the
railway. The reason is that one man can sit at
the front end of a bus and take twenty-five
people down to the beach, but the railway
has to have five men to operate the equipment
required to carry the sane number of passengers by rail. Winter conditions in Ontario
and Quebec make motor traffic possible much
longer than in the West.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Does my friend suggest that
trucking rates cannot be regulated?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They can be regulated to a
certain extent, but we cannot say to the
people of Ontario that they must pay forty
cents a pound on freight from Toronto to
Montreal, which is about the same distance
as between Regina and Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Because there is no way we
in the West can get transport for the distance
at less than forty cents. That is my argument. The honourable senator is reputed to
be a pretty good business man, and I am
sure that if there were a cheaper way of
moving his freight from Toronto to Montreal
he would be one of the first to take advantage
of it. The difficulty must be recognized. As
much as any man I am in favour of reasonable
freight rates in the western provinces and in
the Maritime provinces too; but facts must
be faced. The Maritime provinces have had
some consideration in this matter.

MARCH 21, 1850
Hon. Mr. McLean: Very little.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Al I know is what the law
provides; and according to the law the Maritimes have the benefit of a bonus rate, or
something of the kind, which is not accorded
to the western provinces. The only lower
rate we enjoy is that which was made by the
railway companies themselves under the
Crowsnest Pass Agreement.
As far as I am concerned, I am in favour of
this bill because in my opinion railway matters alone, and not any other business which
the railroads may carry on, should be taken
into consideration when freight rates are
being fixed.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am not sure that I clearly
understand this issue, although I think I get
the point of view of the honourable senator
who raised the question. I could agree with
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) if
enterprises promoted by the railroads, such
as hotels and smelters, were constructed or
purchased with moneys subscribed by the
public by way of bonds or stock purchases.
But I think the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean)
looks at the matter fron the point of view
that if any of these outside properties
are purchased with profits from railway
operationsHon. Mr. Haig: You are right.
Hon. Mr. Euler: -then, in fairness, any
profits which result from those enterprises
should go into the profit and loss account of
the railways. With that contention I am
inclined to agree.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The question raised this
afternoon by the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick is a very important
one. While to my mind there is no doubt that
any profits or losses resulting from operations
after the acquisition of the railway, pursuant
to this bill, will be reckoned in the balance
sheet of the railway companies, I think the
point enunciated by the honourable senator
should receive a more definite answer. So far,
probably because the opportunity has not
arisen, a direct answer to his question has
not been given.
The railway problem is one which requires
more serious thought than it has yet received,
for as we know the cost of railway operation
is now quite a heavy load on the people of
Canada. It has been a greater burden on the
people of British Columbia than on those of
any other province.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Right.
55950-91

Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not going into the story
of the burden that British Columbia has had
to carry since the railway came into our
province. It is well known that the Canadian
Pacific Railway received $100 million and
25,000,000 acres of land to recompense it for
the difficulties it encountered in penetrating
the mountains, although the company ignored
the well-known water grade of the Yellowhead Pass route, now occupied and used by
the Canadian National Railways, and took the
shorter and more expensive route. To me
it has always seemed an absurdity that goods
shipped from Quebec or Ontario to British
Columbia should be carried at a lower rate
than the same class or kind of goods dispatched from British Columbia to the eastern
provinces.
I know there are many angles to this matter, and that it cannot usefully be debated in
this way; but a principle has been raised to
which, I think, the Senate should give serious
thought. Every man, woman and child in the
country is affected by freight rates, and we all
know where the crux of the problem lies.
Passenger transportation is excessively costly,
because, owing to the competition of buses
and aeroplanes, railway passenger business is
becoming less and less.
I hope the sponsor of the bill will deal with
the principle enunciated by the h'onourable
senator from Southern New Bruswick, that
the entire railway system should be looked
upon as one-which I contend has not been
the case in past years, for their investments
have had many ramifications-and profits
derived from investments of surplus funds of
the railway companies should be taken into
consideration in connection with the rate
structure. Of course, as has been pointed out,
very few of the hotels have made a profit. I
think this honourable body should give some
further thought to the solution of the serious
problem to which the honourable senator
from Southern New Brunswick has drawn
attention.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I should like to take one
moment to ariswer a point raised by the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). I
have before me the annual statement of the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company. On its
railway operations the company shows a profit
of approximately $19 million. On the "other
income account", apart from railway operations, the profit amounts to $27 million. Capitalized at 4 per cent, that sum represents
nearly $700 million. Is anyone going to contend, honourable senators, that that $700
million did not come out of railway earnings?
It would take a staff of accountants to examine
tLi company's operations over the years, but
I think I am safe in making the statement

SENATE
that over

50 per cent of this money was

derived from railway earnings. The "other
income" is much larger than the railway
earnings. Perhaps it would be right to require
that no investment should be permitted except
for purposes directly affecting the operation
of the railways; that the money should not be
used to finance industrial enterprises. That
is a matter for Parliament to decide. But,
I repeat, the last C.P.R. report shows "other
income" of $27 million, which, capitalized at
4 per cent, represents $700 million, whereas
the other earnings of the railway amount to
only $19 million. It is only reasonable to suppose that a major portion of this capital came
from the earnings of the railway.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Listening to the debate,
it seems to me that two issues are being
somewhat confused. As I see them, those
issues are: first, is it in the public interest
that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company
should be permitted to acquire these shares
in this company? Is it a provident thing to
do? It seems to me that that issue should not
be confused with the other one which was
raised by my honourable ffriend ffrom Southern
New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean), which is
that so far as collateral investments of railway
companies are concerned, losses as well as
profits should they be taken into consideration
by the Transport Board in regulating freight
rates?, That is an exceedingly important
It is also a controversial one;
question.
there are two sides to it; and I do not think
the discussion of it involves any loss of time
or profit on our part so long as we do not,
when it comes to a vote, confuse the two
issues. Whether this money is to be applied
to the benefit of the shareholders generally, or
whether it is to be applied specifically to
reducing freight rates, is one question. In
either case, if the investment proposed is a
provident one, the prayer of this bill should
be granted.

carried out by the CNR and the CPR at cost,
and any economy will be to the benefit of the
railways. I can also assure my friend that if
the $62,500 is taken out of the earnings of the
CPR, the benefits, if any, will go to "ordinary
account", or the railway account of the CPR.
Whether the railway is to buy these shares out
of earnings or the special account is a matter

instance i, is more economical for the railways
to handle the switching operations themselves
than to have it done by a company which has
not ing to do wita .he operation of railways.
The bill will go to committee where officials of both railways may be heard, and
where the questions of honourable senators
may be answered.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Honourable senators, I
wish to say a few words to correct an
impression which seems to have been created
in the course of this debate, namely, that the
Maritime freight rate is a gift to the Maritime
Provinces. The Duncan Commission, which
investigated the situation in the Maritimes,
found that from 1912 until the date of the
investigation, the freight rates in the Maritime Provinces had increased some 91 per
cent, whereas in Central Canada and in other
parts it had increased 51 per cent. In order
to adjust this difference the Commission
recommended a remission of 20 per cent in
the freight rates to the Maritimes; but even
with this we are paying a greater freight rate
than the rest of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

MARCH 21, 1950
I shall group these amendments in the order
in which I think they are related, and briefly
outline their purpose.
Section 2 of the bill provides for the repeal
of paragraph (b) subsection 1 of section 119
of the Criminal Code, which has been in
operation for some time now and has to do
with the restriction of the possession of firearms by aliens who do not hold permits. The
incorporation of this paragraph in the Act is
a duplication, because later in the Code there
is a provision which covers the possession of
firearms by all persons not holding permits.
Therefore, it does not weaken the Code to
delete paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of section 119; it simply removes a duplication.
Section 3 of the bill deals with the registration of firearms. In 1938 an amendment
was made to the Criminal Code requiring that
al firearms in the possession of Canadians be
registered in 1939 and every five years thereafter. The first registration was made in 1939
and the next was to be made in 1944, but in
the session of 1943-44 parliament passed an
amendment requiring the next registration to
be made in 1945, and every five years
thereafter.
In 1945 this census or registration was
made, but since then a provision has been
incorporated in the Code calling for what one
might term a running inventory of firearms
in Canada. Therefore, the officials of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police have recommended to the government that the subsection requiring the registration of firearms
every five years be abolished, and the government has seen fit to present the amendment proposed in the bill before us. It is
felt that people who register the possession of
firearms in the year of purchase might regard
it as unnecessary to repeat the registration at
the end of five years; therefore, it is proposed
to repeal the subsection in question.
Next I wish to refer to sections 1, 4, 7 and
21. In this group section 4 is the substantive
section, for it repeals Part III of the Criminal
Code. Part III, which has been in the Code
a long time, comprises sections 142 to 154,
under the heading "Respecting the preservation of peace in the vicinity of public works."
It relates to the control of weapons and
liquor. As the explanatory note to the bill
says, "The last time this Part was invoked
was the llth of June, 1928, in connection with
the construction of the Hudson Bay Railway."
Hon. Mr. Leger: Is the fact that a section
of the Criminal Code has not been used for
years a reason for repealing it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have not urged it as a
reason for repeal; I am simply stating that the
last time the Part was used was in 1928. The

sections in this Part are not in force except
upon proclamation of the Governor in Council
in relation to particular works.
Hon. Mr. Leger: The explanatory note says
that the sections are no longer considered
necessary.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. Having regard to
available police protection, the government
is of the opinion that these sections are now
unnecessary.
Sections 1, 7 and 21 of the bill are consequential upon the repeal of Part III of the
Code. Section 1 repeals the definition of
"Part III". Section 7 repeals a number of
sections which, in other parts of the Code,
are ancillary to Part III. Section 21 repeals
a number of sections which it would no longer
be necessary to have in the Code after Part
III was deleted.
We now come to section 5 of the bill, which
relates to burglary of dwelling houses. Sections 457, 458 and 459 of the Criminal Code
create two offences of burglary of dwellings.
One, called burglary by day, is punishable by
imprisonment up to 14 years; the other, called
burglary by night, is punishable by imprisonment for life, and the person convicted of this
offence is liable to be whipped. The dividing
line between day and night, for the purpose
of these sections, is 9 o'clock in the evening.
The department, as a result of experience,
has come to the conclusion that this distinction between day and night in relation to
burglary should be done away with. I think
that one of the impelling reasons for reaching
that conclusion was a recent case in which
a person was charged with having committed
burglary by night. Although it was proved
that he had broken into a place with intent
to commit burglary, the evidence fell short of
establishing that the offence was committed
after 9 o'clock, and therefore he was acquitted.
Section 5 of the bill would repeal the three
sections of the Criminal Code that I mentioned
and substitute therefor a new section 457, providing a single offence of burglary, regardless
of the hour at which it may have been
committed. It also provides for punishment
by imprisonment up to life, and that the person convicted is liable to be whipped.
Hon. Mr. Leger: In other words, the punishment would be increased.
-Hon. Mr. Haig: For daylight robbery, yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, the maximum
punishment is increased, but the present control over sentences, as exercised through the
Courts of Appeal and the Remissions Branch
of the Department of Justice, makes it
unlikely that unduly severe punishments will
be imposed.

SENATE

Section 6 of the bill deals with the offence
cf forgery. At the 'present time three sections
in the Code, 468, 469 and 470, specify more
than forty different types of forgery. The
maximum punishment under section 468 is
imprisonment for life; under section 469 it is
imprisonment up to fourteen years; and under
section 470, imprisonment up to seven years.
Frankly, I find it impossible to relate the
maximum sentences to the respective offences
set out in these three sections. Now it is
proposed to do a little streamlining by repealing these sections and substituting therefor
one section providing a single maximum of
14 years imprisonment for anyone convicted
of forgery, which offence is defined in the
Code.
Section 8 of the bill adds a new subsection
to section 641 of the Code. Under subsection
3 of that section, if the police have raided
premises where gaming house operations were
being carried on the magistrate may authorize
the seizure and destruction of things found
therein and apparently intended to be used for
an illegal purpose. In one such instance the
police found a teletype machine which was
owned, not by the people operating the
gaming house, but by a communications company. The magistrate ordered the destruction
of that equipment, and his decision was.upheld
on appeal. The new subsection 4 makes it
clear that, notwithstanding any other provisions in the Code, the court may not order
the seizure or destruction of any telephone,
telegraph or communication equipment found
upon gaming premises and owned by a telephone or telegraph company or by any
government telephone or telegraph system.
Section 9 of the bill provides an amendment whereby a magistrate may order that
an accused person who is suspected of being
mentally ill shall be remanded for observation. Under the present provision in the
Code a magistrate conducting a preliminary
inquiry has to follow a certain procedure
before having authority to make such an
order. In various provinces devious methods
were followed to get the authority out of the
hands of the federal government under the
Criminal Code, and to put it under some
provincial statute by which a magistrate could
order an accused remanded for observation.
Section 9 of the bill gives authority to the
magistrate at the preliminary inquiry, if he
bas reason to believe that an accused -is
suffering from mental illness, to remand him
for observation for a period not exceeding
thirty days.
Section 10 of the bill seeks to correct a
peculiar situation which was found to exist
concerning the release of exhibits. In one
criminal trial a revolver filed at the preliminary hearing was required for the purpose

of making ballistic experiments; but there
was no provision in the Code under which its
release could be ordered. This section of the
bill authorizes a superior court judge or a
county court judge to release an exhibit, upon
terms which will safeguard the exhibit and
prevent its mutilation.
Section 11 of the bill, which is a bit
involved, will be of interest to all, particularly to lawyers. For some offences an accused
person upon conviction before a magistrate
has the right to launch an appeal. Under an
amendment to the Criminal Code which parliament passed a few years ago, notice of that
appeal could be served at any time within
thirty days of the conviction. But the amendment did not go far enough, in view of the fact
that another subsection of the same section
provided that if a person was convicted
fourteen days or more before the beginning
of the sittings of the court to which his appeal
lay, he must launch his appeal to the sittings
of that -court. The result was that many
accused persons did not get the benefit of the
thirty-day period. If an accused was convicted on March 1, and the sittings to which
he vould appeal ýcommenced on March 16,
his thirty-day period would be reduced to
fifteen days, notwithstanding the fact that the
same section of the Code said that be should
have thirty days in which to appeal. Section 11
of the bill is for the purpose of reconciling the
two subsections and relating the thirty-day
period, and the sittings of the court ýappealed
to, to the service of the notice of appeal rather
than to the date of the original conviction.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Is th( term not shortened
to ten days?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Not necessarily so. The

bill provides that if the service is made ten
days or more before the sittings of the court,
the appeal must be heard at that sitting.
Time runs from the date of service. In other
words, if I made my service on the thirtieth
day within which I had the right to appeal,
the ten-day provision would apply, and I
would have to go before the court sitting commencing within ten days. Time does not run
against me in relation to the sittings of the
court to which I must appeal until I serve
my notice.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is on an appeal

from a summary conviction?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes; where there is a

trial de novo before a county court judge.
The effect of section 12 of the bill will be
to shorten new trials when an appeal from a
summary conviction is taken before a county
court judge. At present, on such an appeal
all the witnesses ire brought before the judge,

MARCH 21. 1950
and the case is heard ail over again. By paragraph (a) of subsection 3 of section 12 a
transcript of the notes of the evidence taken
by the court stenographer on the original trial
may, by consent of the parties, be used before
the county court judge. Under paragraph (b)
of the same subsection the court may use the
transcript in its entirety if it is satisfied that
the attendance of witnesses cannot be reasonabiy obtained; or under paragraph (c) as to
formal matters if it is satisfied that the
opposite party will not be prejudiced.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: 1 do flot like that provision as to formai matters.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, there may be some
things here with which 1 do not entirely
agree.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: 1 do flot think my friend
would agree with that provision.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I arn making a general
explanation of the bll, knowing that in committee I will be able to voice my objections
and make any suggestions I wish. I,,arn.inclined
to the vîew that when a person has a right of
appeal his consent should be required in relation to anything that may cause him to give
Up any of the absolute rights which he enjoys.
I arn not very happy about paragraph (c), but
I do not think it is very important; 1 do not
see how the court could go wrong as to what is
,of a formai nature and what is not.
Hon. Mr. Aseitine: The accused may not
have been properly represented at the preliminary hearing, and there may not have
been proper cross-examination of the witnesses. In those circumstances he wouid have
to abide by what had taken place.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Paragraph (c) reads as
foiiows:

Hon. Mr. Duff: May I ask my honourabie
friend how we got along for the past fifty
years without the special legisiation which he
is introducing now?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I suppose I might answer
my friend by asking how we got aiong fifty
years ago without the advanced medical
science that we have today. We got aiong
somehow, and the healthy survived. Under
the Criminal Code as it was then many
accused persons may have lost some of their
rights because they could not afford a lengthy
repetition of the trial. They would consider
the cost, and decide not to appeai. But that
does not prevent us from progressing and
from streamlining our justice to the same
extent that we have streamlined other matters.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Before my honourable
friend leaves section 12, may I ask him if he
is not exaggerating the effect of that section?
Ail that it does is to allow a court stenographer to prove what happened at a summary trial. Is not that so?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I amn glad my friend has
raised that point. ln many cases where a
court stenographer has taken the notes the
magistrate has refused to certify the
transcript. Under the existing section of the
Code, the oniy way that the transcript of
evidence taken at the triai couid be submitted on appeal would be by producing the
transcript and havîng it certified by the magistrate. That is an added reason for the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is that not the only eff ect?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, although paragrapbs
(a) and (c) are new.
Hon. Mr. Farris: But they relate only to

SENATE
Sections 13, 14 and 15 are formal. To adapt
this portion of the Code to the situation
wherein Newfoundland is part of Canada, it
is necessary to correct some of the discrepancies and harmonize the references. It was
not possible to do this last fall, when the
matter was before us and I had the privilege
of explaining the amendments.
Section 16 is a simple provision which gives
power to a magistrate to require the attendance before him of a person who may be confined in prison somewhere in Canada when a
proceeding is going on before such magistrate.
Up to the present time that authority has
extended only to a superior or a county court
judge.
We come now to section 18. Those of you
who read this morning's issue of the
Globe and Mail will have found this item
featured in its story of these amendments. I
suggest to you, however, that actually this
section is quite unimportant; it merely eliminates something which the government does
not regard as consistent with our present
criminal administration.
It deals with
moieties, and proposes the repeal of sections
1041, 1042 and 1043 of the Code. The explanation is simply this. Under those three sections, an informer who informed in respect
of an offence therein referred to was entitled
to be paid one-half of the penalty. Section
1041 deals with the possession of or the
negotiating or attempting to negotiate what is
called "uncurrent copper coin", that is, any
copper coin other than that which is current
for currency purposes. I think it will be
admitted that this does not appear to be so
very important a matter; and the government
has decided that police forces and police
methods have been developed to such an
extent that the administration of justice can
be carried on quite well without having an
informer and providing for payment to him
of a moiety of the penalty for an offence of
this kind. Section 1042 deals with various
offences relating to desertion from the Army,
the Navy and the Air Force. Hitherto the
Code has provided that a person who informed
as to the whereabouts of a deserter, or where
he had been harboured, would be entitled to
receive one-half of the penalty imposed upon
a conviction for desertion. That section is to
be repealed.
Section 1043, dealing with the same application of fines for offences in relation to
cruelty to animals, is being repealed, and for
the same reason, namely that it is felt that
police methods are adequate to deal with
these matters without relying on informers.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In connection wiih section
17,
does the
word "prison"
include
penitentiaries?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Oh, yes. "Any prison"
means just what it says.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Any penitentiary?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Section 19 of the bill also is very simple.
Several years ago, when we passed an amendment to the Criminal Code dealing with what
are called criminal sexual psychopaths, we
provided that at the trial of such a person
the Minister of Justice should designate a
psychiatrist who would give evidence of his
opinion as to the condition of the accused.
In practice that provision has proved very
cumbersome. Suppose a trial is going on in
some city or town or village, it may be necessary to wire or write to the Minister of Justice and have him designate a psychiatrist.
This is an awkward way of proceeding; and
as the criminal administration is in the hands
of the provinces, and the authority to select
a psychiatrist pertains to the Minister of
Justice, of course the provincial authorities
are always ready to say, "You appointed this
man; you should pay him." The amendment
substitutes "Attorney General" for "Minister
of Justice".
Hon. Mr. Reid: There is nothing in the law
which says someone should examine the
psychiatrist!
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No-except counsel for
the accused.
May I now briefly refer to section 20 of
the bill. Tied in with it are sections 17, 22
and 23. Section 20 inserts in the Criminal
Code a section to bring into one place the
provisions dealing with the commencement
of sentence, and subsection 5 makes it clear
that where a person applies for leave to
appeal the same consequences follow under
the Code as if it were an appeal.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why the difference
between subsections 2 and 4?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I answer that question as soon as I finish the factual explanations?
Somewhat similar provisions are
found in three statutes dealing with commencement of sentences-namely, the Criminal Code, the Penitentiary Act, and the
Prisons and Reformatories Act. The department finally caught up with the situation and
concluded that the confusion which results
from the use, in three federal statutes, of
varying language, probably aimed at the
same effect, is such that all the provisions
should be put in one statute. So these provisions dealing with commencement of
sentences are to be placed in one section of
the Code; and sections 17, 22 and 23 will
provide for the repeal of the existilg sections
dealing with commencement of sentences

which now appear in the Code, the Penitentiary Act, and the Prisons and Reformatories
Act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does not section 1 of
1054B change the law?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not think so.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Under section 2 this
remains at the discretion of the judge.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, but it is not found in

Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, because under section 4 the judge has no discretionary powers

Hon. Mr. Duff: May I have the temerity to
ask the honourable leader if he has given
any consideration to when and for how long
this honourable house will adjourn for the
Easter recess? We who come from the far
corners of Canada have considerable difficulty
obtaining reservations in order to get to our
homes. I have a little garden in which I
want to plant some tomatoes and cucumbers,
and if I do not know when I am going to be
home my gardening may not be done. Surely
the honourable leader would be good enough
to give us some information. Last week the
leader of the government in another place
did not hesitate to tell the members of that
house when their adjournment would take
place and how long a recess they would
have, so I think we should be informed here
when we can go home and when we must
return.

Honourable senators, I arn concerned about
the way freight rates have been pyramiding in western Canada, and from the lively
discussion which took place yesterday on the
simple bill introduced by the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), I
gather that other honourable senators are
equally interested in this question.
I have given this matter much thought, and
have corne to the conclusion that plans for the
amalgamation of the two railway systerns
should be worked out. The first duty of the
cornpany operating the combined systemn
would be to put into effect ahl measures of
co-operation which could be adopted to effect
savings by eliminating waste and duplication
of service.
1Mr. E. W. Beatty, former presiclent of the
Canadian Pacific Railway Comnpany, in an
address delivered before the Canadian Political Science Association in Montreal on May
22, 1934, advocated that, in order to put an end
to the waste of competition, the two railway
systems-the Canadian National and the
Canadian Pacific-should be unified underthe control of the CPR for the purposes of,
administration only. He said:

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

Later in the same address Mr. Beatty, in referring to the estirnated saving of $75 million a
year, said:

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed frorn Friday, March
17, the consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Golding for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. G. H. Ross: Honourable senators, I
wish in the first place to join with those
who have preceded me in complimenting the
mover (Hon. Mr. Golding) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Veniot) of the Address. The mover
ha-, had a vast experience both in the business
world and in the other place, so naturally we
expected rnuch of him, and we were not
disappointed. As to the seconder, I presumne
he spoke well in French, but I have asked
hirn next time he speaks in the house to use
Parisian French, because a number of us do
not understand Acadian French too welil.
Han. Mr. Leger: There is no difference.
Same Han. Senatars: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I have no doubt that he
spoke well in Acadian French, because when
he undertook to speak in English he made an
excellent job of it.

As the resuit of an exhaustive analysis of the
accounts by our officers. I have stated that under
the forrn of unification proposed there would be
a saving of seventy-five million dollars in a year
of normal traffic. which amount would be increased
as the trade of the country expancied inx future
years.

Estimates of those savings were made at varlous
times by the late Lord Shaughnessy. by the late
Sir Henry Thornton. by Mr. Fairweather, Economist of the Canadian National Railway. and by the
present officers of the Canadian Pacifie. These
submissions can be regarded with respect as the
fruits of deep study, conducted by men of experience. All of their estimates. though rnade at difThe
ferent times, are very similar in resuit.
estimate presented by the Canadian Pacific to the
Royal Commission was examined and analyzed by
independent railway economists of standing and
repute in the United States, and was pronounced
unassailable.

Consequently, in the opinion of those who,
should know best, very substantial economies
could be worked out under a unified system.
I should point out here that since Mr. Beatty
delivered that address some minor co-operative measures have been put into effect under
the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act
of 1933, but the economies effected were
cornparatively small.
For the past seventy years national policy
in Canada has required that the railroads
be built east and west, and has maintained
high protective tariffs in order to channel

SENATE
trade through Canada and keep out American
goods. In what I am about to say I am
not approving or condemning that policy. I
am merely reminding honourable senators of
what Canada's national policy has been, and
I desire to point out how it affects areas
without water competition, particularly the
prairie provinces.
At about the time of confederation, Canadian railways applied to the Canadian
Government for franchises to enter the
Canadian prairies through the United States.
But Canadian national policy would not
permit it. American railways also tried to
get such franchises and were refused.
As a result of the Canadian national policy
which required the railways to build east
and west throughout Canada it became necessary for each of three roads in building
transcontinental lines to bridge a thousand
miles of waste land north of Lake Superior.
Such construction and maintenance make
high freight rates necessary.
Now if we wish to produce in the West,
far from markets, we must expect to have
to pay reasonable charges for getting our
products to market. But Canada pursues
a policy which requires us to pay excessive
transportation charges on what we buy and
sell. As these excessive charges are imposed
in the interest of the national economy of
the whole of Canada, they should be borne
by Canada as a whole.
Railway construction costs on the prairies
are low, owing to the nature of the terrain:
gradients are easy, and there are few cuts
and fills. There are no rock slides, there
is little or no snow removal; and the life
of wooden ties and structures is long, by
reason of the dry climate. Yet freight rates
are higher on the prairies than in Ontario
and Quebec.
To illustrate: in many cases the freight for
shipments of goods is lower between Toronto
and Vancouver than between Toronto and
Calgary, notwithstanding that goods shipped
via the Canadian Pacific Railway would have
to pass through Calgary and be carried 600
miles further over a mountainous road. For
example, according to a newspaper dispatch,
the Toronto-Vancouver rate on canned meats
is less than one-half the Toronto-Calgary
rate.
The cost of shipping for a greater distance
should in no case be less than the cost of
shipping for a shorter distance over the
same route.
The Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada fixes maximum rates for the railways. The railways are free to reduce those
rates to meet competition. They do reduce

them in parts of Eastern Canada, to meet
competition, particularly from water. This
has been the practice for some time.
In 1948 the railways were allowed to raise
their rates by 21 per cent. They took full
advantage of this where there is no water
competition. Where there is competition
they depressed their rates to meet it. As a
result of the 1948 and former hoists, freight
rates on the prairies were approximately 15
per cent higher than rates in Ontario and
Quebec, where there is water competition.
Two boosts in freight rates have recently
been allowed in addition to the 21 per cent
raise awarded in 1948. The rates in the
prairie provinces already being higher than
in Ontario and Quebec, the last horizontal
raise of 16 per cent imposes a greater burden
on the prairie provinces than on Ontario and
Quebec. The combined boosts on the prairies
amount to an increase of more than 40 per
cent over wartime rates on the traffic to
which they apply. As the Ottawa Journal
pointed out in reporting the last two increases:
The railways are expected to apply the increases
to the full extent of the award except on competitive rates-those that have been depressed to meet
competition-on which they likely will modify any
rises in accord with competitive factors.

This means that the prairies, already paying excessive rates, will have to bear the
raise to the full extent. Other parts of
Canada, having water competition, will not
have to bear their full share of the raise, and
as a result the Canadian Pacific Railway cannot get the full revenue contemplated by the
raise.
What will happen? According to the press
it has already happened. The CPR is applying for a still further increase of rates. If
they get it, the prairie provinces will have
to bear the biggest share of the added burden. And so rates continue to spiral in the
prairie provinces.
In future the competition from trucks and
airships is bound to be much greater than in
the past. This will have the effect of diverting traffic from the railways, and will lead to
demands for still higher rates. Where is this
pyramiding of rates going to end?
I am sure that the people in those portions
of Ontario and Quebec which benefit by
water competition do not wish to be unfair
to the prairies. They expect us to pay for
the longer haul occasioned by reason of our
being farther from markets than they are.
This attitude is quite proper. But I do not
think they will expect us to pay higher freight
on the prairies, where the cost of railway
construction is lighter than in other parts of
Canada where the cost of rail construction
is much heavier.

MARCH 22, 1950
Furthermore, Canada's national policy of
east-west traffic and high tariffs has not been
helpful to us on the prairies, as the added
burden nets us a smaller price for the products we sell outside, and requires us to pay
more for what we buy abroad. The policy
may be beneficial to Canada as a whole, but
it certainly is of no benefit to the Prairie
Provinces; and I do not believe the other
provinces will expect us to pay the excess
freight rates occasioned by that policy. As
the policy has been carried out for the benefit
of Canada as a whole, Canada as a whole
should pay for it. I do not think anyone
should quarrel with that statement.
What is the remedy?
Canada has already paid high subsidies to
the railways in order that they might be built
and operated with low freight and passenger
rates. We might pay them further subsidies
out of the general revenue of Canada, so that
they could carry on at reduced rates, or we
might amalgamate the railways and turn the
CNR over to the CPR to be operated as a
unified system, as suggested by Mr. Beatty.
However, the people of Canada would
revolt at either of these proposals. I well
remember that back in the depression days
of 1913 and 1914 the farmers and labourers
of Canada were fearful of the influence
wielded by the railway companies throughout
Canada, and denounced them as an octopus
of far-reaching capacity for harm. Should
the railways throughout Canada be operated
and controlled by any company or individual
other than a government board, the whole
country would raise an uproar. They would
not stand for it.
An alternative course would be to impose
taxes or other burdens on common carrierssuch as ships using the waterways, trucks
using the highways, or aircraft using the airways. Such burdens would have to be made
so heavy that the railways could successfully
compete with the other carriers. This would
impose such a tremendous burden on producers in all parts of Canada, particularly on
those producing for export, that in many cases
it might become impossible for them to compete in world markets.

Such a policy, aimed at diverting to the railways trafflc from ships, trucks and airplanes
transporting for hire, would defeat its own
purpose, as large dealers, barred from using
carriers for hire, would buy and use their
own trucks and other means of transportation.
Another alternative plan, and the plan
which I think should be carried out, is as
follows:
1. The Canadian Pacific Railway should be
nationalized and amalgamated with the Canadian National Railways and operated by the
people of Canada for the benefit of the Canadian economy as a whole.
2. In fixing freight rates, regard should be
had to rates on water, on the highways and in
the air. Probably the traffic should pay
operating expenses, maintenance and repairs.
It should not be expected to pay interest on
the investment. That would have to be taken
care of out of general revenue.
3. Should there be any profit over and
above operating expenses, maintenance and
repairs, it couid be paid into the general
revenue fund of Canada: any losses would
have to be paid out of that fund.
Under this plan, no undue burden would
be imposed on any part of Canada. It would
work out fairly to all sections. Furthermore,
it would be helpful to all producers in Canada,
as it would provide lower freight rates and
thus give Canadian producers for export an
advantage over their competitors that they
do not now have.
To the people in the prairie provinces this
is a very serious problem. It is a serious
problem to people in all parts of Canada. We
must face it sooner or later. Let us deal with
it now.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
it is my intention today to take the liberty of
discussing some of the features of the international situation. Before doing so I wish,
in keeping with a tradition of the Canadian
parliament, to pay tribute to the mover (Hon.
Mr. Golding) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Veniot) of the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. I do so not only because
it is a tradition, but because I feel that a
compliment is particularly deserved by the
honourable senator for Huron-Perth.(Hon. Mr.
Golding) for the manner in which he emphasized the success of individual pioneer efforts.
He brought to mind the human rewards
which naturally flow from such endeavours
in a free country.
I wish also to express a word of admiration
for the honourable senator from Gloucester
(Hon. Mr. Veniot), not.only because Gloucester happens to be the place of my birth, which
took place some time before I went to British
Columbia, but because of the excellent manner in which he dealt with the subject matter
of his address. Because I was born, as I say,
in New Brunswick, on the Atlantic fishing
coast, and now live in and represent an area
in British Columbia on the Pacific fishing
coast, I take this opportunity to express my

appreciation of the manner in which the honourable senator sumrged up the many things
that have been done for the fishing industry.
He showed clearly what private enterprise
can do and how a democratic government can
properly give assistance to industry.
Much has been done by the Honourable
Robert W. Mayhew, Minister of Fisheries, who
comes from British Columbia. Those of us
from this honourable body who last evening
attended the banquet of the Fisheries Council
of Canada, heard a resolution passed by that
council repeating the tributes paid by the
honourable senator for Gloucester to the Minister of Fisheries for the great work he has
done in directing the activities of his
department.
I said that I wished to say a few words
about the international situation and the
part that Canada has been playing and must
continue to play internationally. I am taking
the liberty of making a suggestion having an
implication which, unless I clearly indicate
why I am making it and what, if carried out,
it could accomplish, will, I fear, bring disagreement. I want to talk particularly about
the work of the Atomic Energy Commission,
and what representatives of the democratic
countries are trying to do to prevent the
use of hydrogen and atomic bombs in war.
First let me give my suggestion, and then
some of the thoughts that have occurred to
me in pondering this problem.
My suggestion is that one of the democratic
countries should indicate a desire to have a
meeting of the Atomic Energy Commissionwhich as you know consists of the five
Great Powers and Canada-or of the Security
Council sitting with the Atomic Energy Commission-which also would include a representative of Canada-without the presence
of a representative of China. I know that
this proposal will be misunderstood,. But I
would go further and express the hope that
the Chinese delegate to the United Nations
at Lake Success would declare the willingness of the Chinese Nationalist Government
that such a meeting be held without the
attendance of the Chinese representative.
May I digress for a moment to say a few
words with respect to the feelings which
the invention of atomic and hydrogen bombs
have aroused in Canada and other democratic
countries. One notices the prevalence of a
belief among our own people that all governments, not merely that of the Soviet Union,
are unconcerned as to whether these bombs
should be used. Among Canadians generally
there exists a fear of war and, more particularly, of what will happen if we are attacked
with hydrogen or atomic bombs. Closely
linked with these apprehensions is a dread,
which I would call spiritual, that unless
preventive measures are taken the time will

SENATE

come when we Canadians will be forced to
use these poisonous, execrable weapons
against people of other lands who happen
to be our enemies. I venture to say that
the spiritual fear that we shall have to use
these weapons is even stronger than the fear
that they will be used against us.
There is another misapprehension under
which many people are living. There is an
idea that the fear of the democratic nationsCanada, the United States, the United Kingdom and France-concerning the hydrogen
bomb, has existed only since it has become
common knowledge that from 1947 Russia has
been making atomic bombs. This idea is
false and completely unfounded. The records
of the United Nations Assembly meetings
and various world conferences show conclusively that as far back as 1945, long
before Russia had any of the scientific
knowledge necessary to even contemplate
the production of an atomic bomb, President
Truman of the United States, Prime Minister
Attlee of the United Kingdom and the then
Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King,
suggested that something should be done to
make it impossible for any nation to use
atomic bombs. They went even further, and
expressed a willingness to give to the world
at large all the atomic information they
possessed so that atomic energy could be
devoted to peaceful purposes
Through conversations, letters, and articles
in the press, I find there is also a feeling that
what we call the cold war-this great cleavage between the Soviet Union and the democratic countries of the world-is simply an
antagonism which has developed between the
Soviet Union and the United States. Many
resolutions passed by Canadian associations
have contained not only denunciations of the
activities of Soviet agents in Canada, but also
statements to the effect that the people of
the world are being torn apart by the conflict
between Russian communism and American
capitalist imperialism. The general thought
of various Canadian associations is that all
this trouble arises from a conflict between
Russia and the United States. Naturally, the
members of the Soviet government circulate
this idea. For instance, we read in Russian
newspapers that Truman is advancing the
doctrine of Wall street. Well, honourable
senators know that there is not much affinity
of purpose between Wall street and President
Truman. Yet, this thought, expressed by
organs and individuals of the Soviet Union,
is becoming effective in Canada as an argument in support of the contention that this
whole trouble is one between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
A few moments ago I said that in 1945
Great Britain, the United States and Canada
offered to give to the world, including Russia,
the secret of atomic power; and yet it was

only after President Truman announced a
few months ago that an atomic explosion had
taken place in Russia, that the Soviet Union
declared that she had produced atomic bombs
in 1947. During all that time, when the
Atomic Energy Commission had been
endeavouring to solve the world's atomic
problem, everyone knew that the United
States had a stockpile of atomic bombs and
that Canada possessed the uranium essential
to the production of atomic bombs; yet the
United States and Canada were two of the
countries desirous of forming an agreement
to prevent the use of atomic bombs.
Honourable senators, I believe there are
two great barriers in the way of reaching a
solution to this problem. One barrier is the
attitude of Russia. Without the co-operation
of Russia there will be no solution to prevent
the use of atomic or hydrogen bombs, and
the only
without Russian co-operation
recourse will be an increased determination
on our part to make certain that if war does
come we shall have the bombs and other
weapons, regardless of how poisonous and
malicious they are, to frustrate any country
that starts an aggressive war upon us or any
nation with which we are allied.
I am one of those who really are afraid
that war will come, and yet I am so anxious
to see sornething positive done to pre7vent the
use of atomic weapons that I make the recommendation that the Atomic Energy Commission should sit without the presence of a
representative of Nationalist China. When I
say that I fear war will come, I am basing
that fear upon the inability of our countries
to reach an agreement on any of the vitally
important matters that have come before
The law of self-preservation is not
therm.
restricted to the individual but attaches itself
to what we call a state or country. If a
country is at war and there is fear that the
enemy will use atomic or hydrogen bombs,
or any other infamous weapons of war, then
the law of self-preservation would cause that
country to use whatever weapons it had to
destroy its enemy. But we must remember
that Russia says that under no consideration
will the Soviet Union enter into a discussion
on any topic with the governments of other
countries if the present government of China
is represented at that conference.
What we have to ask ourselves is whether
we are going to allow that condition to continue. Are we going to say to Russia that
we will not enter into any conference with
her on prevention of the use of atomic
weapons in the event of war, unless China
also is represented at that conference?
May I digress again? I would be opposed
to the recognition of the communist government of China at this moment. What will
happen in the future, God alone knows; but

MARCH 23, 1950

in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of
many, the communist government of China
is entirely under military control.
Hon. Mr. David: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Anything might happen.
To my mind-and I speak humbly as a citizen
-there is no reason why any of our democratic countries should jump to conclusions
and seek to bring about a general recognition
of the communist government of China. But
there is every reason why the governments
of democratic countries should take all possible steps to make certain that if war does
come atomic weapons will not be used-either
by others against us or by us against others.
I have pointed out that in my opinion the
first barrier to settlement of this problem is
the refusal-the unjust refusal, if you wishof the Soviet Union to participate in any
conference at which nationalist China is
represented.
Now, before I discuss what I regard as the
second barrier, may I express another
thought? I have said that I fear there will
be another war. But if through a series of
conferences the Atomic Energy Commission
could bring about some agreement for empowering the United Nations to prevent the
use of atomic and hydrogen bombs-I mean a
positive and absolute agreement along the
lines that the President of the United States
and the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and of Canada had in mind in 1945, when
they urged the nations of the world to agree
on making the use of atomic bombs impossible
-and if the people of Canada and of all other
democratic countries could be given definite
assurance that these bombs would not and
could not be used in the event of war, then
my feeling as to the future would change.
One of the first results of such an agreement would be the elimination of that atmosphere of distrust and suspicion which now
pervades all United Nations conferences and
causes representatives of one country to doubt
the sincerity of other countries' representatives, and in place of suspicion there would
be a general feeling of confidence and trust.
In short, honourable senators, I believe that
the reaching of such an agreement would be
the most important step taken since the end
of the last war towards the prevention of
another war.
I come now to the second great barrier,
which is the Soviet Union's stand that to
permit the United Nations, through any
agency whatever, te make proper inspections
and to take any necessary action to prevent
the production of atornic and hydrogen bombs
for war purposes, would be a breach of
sovereignty. Now, if a conclusion could be
reached among the great powers-and on
account of the conditions in China and the
attitude of Russia, I suggest that we should

hold conferences at which China is not represented-if a conclusion could be reached that
certain means taken by the United Nations
would be successful in preventing the use of
these bombs for war purposes, I believe we
could convince the Soviet Union and any
other country that the employment of such
means would not entail any breach of
sovereignty.
I do not need to remind the members of
this august body that for democratic countries
the idea of complete national sovereignty
belongs to the ages that are past. It is strange
to us, whose allegiance is given directly to His
Majesty the King, that the very country which
fears a breach of sovereignty should be a
communistic country where it is claimed that
everything is done by the people and for the
people, and where it is also claimed that the
capitalism, free enterprise and individual
effort of the democracies are symbols of
economic slavery. Canada is processing
uranium ore at Chalk River and possibly may
do so at other places later on, but Canadians
would never imagine that the empowering of
the United Nations to inspect uranium plants
or any other plants in this country would
-imply a breach of our national sovereignty.
However, since we desire a conference or
a series of conferences that might lead to an
agreement for preventing the use of atornic
and hydrogen bombs, we must make'some
concession. The concession which I am suggesting is not one that relates to the means
to be adopted by the United Nations. I do
not suggest simply that the United States be
asked to discard the bombs they have on
hand. The thought I have in mind is that a
concession should be made by our democratic
powers which will remove every reason given
by the Soviet Union as to why it cannot, or
will not, enter into discussions of any nature
at which the representative of the present
government of China is present.
I wish to quote a short excerpt from a
speech delivered last November by ou own
Minister of External Affairs, the Honourable
L. B. Pearson. In discussing the atomic bomb,
the minister had this to say:
The problem of atomic energy is such that it
seems to me that ail of us should seek its solution
with humility, as well as with sincerity. If any
new proposals are made, or new approaches suggested, that give promise of an effective and agreed
solution for this problem, then my government will
welcome them and examine them with all the care
they will deserve.

It is with that sincerity and humility to
which the honourable minister referred that
I am today suggesting an acquiescence which
would bring about a conference that might
be the first necessary step in the prevention
of total war. I am placing this suggestion
before this honourable house, and on it
honourable members will take what action

SENATE
they think proper after they haye carefully
studied it. I am anxious, however, before this
suggestion is put aside, that it be given
serious consideration.
I come to another aspect of the international
situation closely related to atomic energy and
hydrogen bombs. Honourable senators may
not recall a speech I made in this house some
two years ago, when I sponsored a measure
the purpose of which was aid to mining. I
pointed out at that time that in the thirties
Stalin took two distinct actions. One was
when he ousted Trotsky. I said at that time
that it was my opinion that Trotsky wanted
to spread communism all across Europe, but
that Stalin's reply was: No, we must make
certain that communism-or socialism, as he
called it-is first properly rooted in Russia,
and, secondly, is properly disseminated
throughout Asia.
At the beginning of the Soviet Union Lenin
discarded gold, and prospectors for gold were
put into labour camps. After Stalin's break
with Trotsky all the prospectors were removed
from the camps and put to work in the production of gold. Honourable senators will
recall that at least two score eminent
engineers were taken to Russia for help in
industrial development there, a great part of
which was engaged in the production of gold.
I pointed out to this house that Stalin chose
for the production of gold that part of Siberia
east of the Ural mountains and immediately
adjacent to Manchuria, Inner and Outer Mongolia, and the northwesterly portion of China,
called Sin Kiang. We all know what has happened in China since that time. One can
readily observe the recent large output of
gold from China. Those who have inquired
know the general source of this supply; but
they do not know its specific source, nor do
they know what is behind it.
Honourable senators will recall reading in
the newspapers a few weeks ago that Soviet
Russia has recently changed the value of its
ruble, and has related it to gold. This brings
us to another feature of our international
affairs-the question of trade and commerce
and its relation to currency. The Honourable
Mr. Howe, Minister of Trade and Commerce,
speaking in New York a week or two ago said
that the United States would have to increase
its imports. The subject of currency naturally
brings to mind the International Monetary
Fund. From reading not only the agreement
by which the fund was created, but also the
discussions which took place when its creation
was in the process of accomplishment, one
will find that there was an understanding on
the part of those nations represented at the
conference, that the United States was prepared to increase its imports. Whether this
was to be done by tariff changes or by regula-

tions is immaterial, but there was a general
feeling that the United States was about ready
to increase its imports.
Now I am a great friend of the United
States. I feel that without her help and
direction in the years since the end of the
second world war anything might have
happened, not only to Canada but to Great
Britain and much of Europe. Yet, that does
not mean the United States has always done
the right thing. All the billions of dollars
that were expended by that country in the
last few years have accomplished a great
deal; but, in my opinion, much more could
have been accomplished had the expenditure
of smaller sums of money been accompanied
by the co-operation which is so vital to trade
and commerce, namely the admission of
foreign goods into that country.
In the year 1946, speaking at a conference
in Prague concerning trade and currency, I
expressed the opinion-which, incidentally,
nobody accepted-that the trade of eastern
Europe with Russia must be increased, but
a monoply must not be allowed to develop:
and that trade between eastern and western
Europe must increase, but that this was
utterly impossible unless something were
done to create proper currency conditions.
Today the problem of currency has not
changed for the better; in fact, in many ways
it has worsened since that time; and something must be done to make possible a greater
interchange of commodities, not only between
Canada and the United States but between
the United States and Great Britain and
other European countries. That is the second
suggestion I am throwing out, because,
naturally, between now and the end of the
parliamentary session, questions of trade and
commerce will receive a great deal of careful
consideration.
I thank you for the courtesy and the
patience with which you have listened to
me today. In closing, I repeat my recommendation that steps be taken to hold a
meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission,
including representatives of Canada and
four of the Great Powers, but not a representative of the Chinese Nationalist Government, so that Russia shall be present at the
conference and be compelled to accept or
reject proposals presented by Canada, the
United States, the United Kingdom and
France or to make proposals that can be
accepted by these other countries. I make
that suggestion, knowing that it will receive
your careful consideration.

THE SENATE

SENATE
this additional sum of $402,000 is required
to make up a deficit caused by the devaluation
of the Canadian dollar to 90 cents.
Vote No. 583, which amounts to $2,500,000,
is occasioned by the fact that the government
has had to make an additional contribution
because more persons than were anticipated
have come under the provisions of the
Unemployment Insurance Act. The expenditure has nothing directly to do with payment
of benefits: but as more people were employed
during the relevant period than had been
anticipated, the government's contribution,
which as honourable senators know bears
a direct proportion to payments by employers
and employees, is larger than was expected.
The sum of $700,000 asked for in item
No. 584 is required because unemployment
in Newfoundland has been more extensive
than was anticipated.
The sum of $1,500,000 set out in Vote No.
585 is necessitated by a recent amendment
of the Unemployment Insurance Act which
authorizes additional payments in the winter
months. Honourable senators will recall that
one of the first measures we dealt with this
session was a bill to enlarge the scope
of the Unemployment Insurance and, as I
recall it, that bill received the Royal Assent
just at the end of last month. My information
is that this vote represents the additional
amount required for that purpose.
Item 592, $4 million, is to provide for the
purchase of British Admiralty property in
Newfoundland. The government of Canada
undertook, upon completion of negotiations,
to pay $7 million for this property. Of this
sum $3 million has already been authorized,
and this vote is to cover the remaining
amount.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask if this expenditure of $7 million has anything to do
with American assets in Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not believe so.
It is to cover the purchase of British naval
property in Newfoundland, which was consequential upon Newfoundland joining confederation.
Item 601, Dominion Forestry Service,
$250,000: I am advised that this vote is
necessary in pursuance of an arrangement
under the Canadian Forestry Act, which was
passed for the purpose of assisting the various
provincial governments in forestry projects.
This vote of $250,000 has been expedited to
meet a severe unemployment condition in
New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would the honourable
leader explain Vote No. 609, for the sum of
$1? I have read the item over two or three
times, but have been unable to understand it.

If my honourable friend cannot explain the
item, he may let it go. We shall put up the
$1 anyway.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I must confess that I
should have thought that the western members would have demanded more than the
$1 to take care of these requirements; but
perhaps they anticipated the keen interest
in economy which the Senate is displaying
and desired not to spend any more than was
absolutely necessary.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I fancy, however, that
this item has to do with the authorization of
a joint expenditure with provincial or municipal administrations. I think perhaps some
honourable senator from British Columbia
would be better informed about this than
I am.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Vote No. 604 is for the
same amount. It puzzles me.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It must be a token
expenditure to cover an undetermined sum
for work that has been authorized. I submit
both of these votes to the scrutiny of the
committees to which the respective estimates
have been referred.
Vote No. 612 is for $3,884,182. In 1948
the Canadian Wheat Board bought a heavy
flax crop at a guaranteed price, and because
of the disappearance of the market the crop
could not be sold that year. The board
was selling it in 1949 but the price had
dropped. The amount of this vote is to
cover the loss incurred as a result of the
drop in price, and additional carrying charges
for this year.
Vote No. 613 is to reimburse the Canadian
Wheat Board for the deficit incurred from
its operations on the 1948 crop rapeseed
account for the period ended July 31, 1949,
pursuant to the regulations passed under the
Appropriation Act No. 4. The amount is
$399,608. I take it that this item is in the
same category as Vote No. 612, but applying
to rapeseed instead of to flax.
Vote No. 619, for $435,295, is a further
amount required for payments under a
dredging contract for Montreal harbour. As
to why the amount of the original estimate
has been exceeded, I must say I have no
particular information.
Vote No. 622, for $190,771, is a further
amount required to pay freight rates assistance under the Maritime Freight Rates Act.
I presume it is never possible to estimate
exactly the amount that will be necessary
under that Act, which, as honourable senators know, is a statutory undertaking to pay
a certain proportion of the freight rates in
the Maritime region.

MARCH
Vote No. 634, for $1,425,000, is explained
by the fact that the number of veterans who
applied for benefits under the Veterans'
Land Act was larger than had been anticipated.
As I intimated before, honourable senators,
I am not attempting to explain every
individual item. I have covered the larger
ones. If any additional information is required it could probably best be secured
through the respective committees to which
the estimates have been referred.
Hon. Mr. Leger: I understand that the
reason for Vote No. 587, which is for a small
amount, is that the Internal Economy Committee of the Senate had not passed the
customary motion.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That may be the
reason why the amount was not included
last year.
Hon. John T. Haig: It is; I know.
Honourable members, I hope not to delay
the house at any length. This bill is, of course,
not in the same category as the second supply
bill that is to corne before us today. The
second one is simply to grant supply for the
coming two months, but the bill now before us
covers moneys that will be expended between
now and the 31st of March. The surprising
thing is that this bill asks for $65 million in
addition to the sum that we voted a little more
than three months ago.
I do not intend to deal with this bill as a
budget matter, but I think there are two or
three things about it that ought to be drawn
to the attention of honourable members. For
instance, some of the items in it are forerunners of similar items that will be appearing before us often in the next three or four
y'ears. One such item is vote No. 570, on the
first page of the schedule. The honourable the
minister (Hon. Mr. Robertson) did not explain
this, but apparently the reason for the vote
is that the government guaranteed certain
products and has carried them at a loss. The
amoujit here is $350,000, not a very large sum,
but important because, as I say, it is likely to
be the first of a number of similar votes that
we shall be asked to make in the next three
or four years. So we had better get used to
this kind of thing.
I was hoping the minister would give a full
explanation of the vote to provide for our
contribution to the International Refugee
Organization. I do not remember that this
came up last year at all, and there bas never
been much discussion of it in this house.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Which vote is that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Vote No. 574.

Vote No. 581 provides an amount of $1
under the annuities Act. I cannot understand
this practice of asking for a vote of $1, and
I was hoping there would be an explanation.
Apparently the government requires that vote
in order to cover money already expended. The
only conclusion that I can come to is that it
is merely a token vote.
Vote No. 583, the government's contribution
to the Unernployment Insurance Fund, is for
a further amount of $2,500,000. Honourable
mambers must bear in mind that it was only
last November when the vote to cover the
government's contribution to this fund was
passed in another place, and it was passed
here as late as December. It seems to me
that $2,500,000 is a terrific increase of expenditure to have occurred within the short space
of about four months. When we voted the
previous amount, eight months of the year
had gone by, and this request for an additional
$2,500,000 indicates that there must have been
a tremendous increase in unemployment during the intervening period. Over the radio
and in the newspapers the government has
constantly denied that there was any unemployment at all, although, of course, we all
knew there was considerable. Here, as I say,
we have what appears to be definite proof.
The second vote under the Unemployment
Insurance Act, Vote No. 584, is for payment of
unemployment assistance to residents of Newfoundland. I had probably better be careful
in what I am about to state here, but I will
say to my friends, from Newfoundland that we
are married to that island and we certainly
have got a pretty expensive bride. I will not
go any further than that at the moment.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: And you are on the
Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I am not. I salute you
and say that I am not. A number of distinguished members of this house-tlawyers from
Ottawa and other parts of the country-have
taken my place on that committee, and I am
now free to criticize anything the committee
may do.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Do you think the
committee has improved?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it has much
improved.
There is a third item under the Unemployment Insurance Act, Vote No. 585, for
$1,500,000, to réimburse the Unemployment
Insurance Fund. To me that is an indication
that the government recognizes the existence
of unemployment all over the country. There
is no doubt that unemployment such as we
have had during this past winter should be
the responsibility of the Dominion of Canada.
If the federal government continues to choose

SENATE
to control immigration and trade policies,
then it must also assume responsibility for
unemployment. In the past the provinces and
municipalities have had no chance to get back
any of the money they spent to relieve unemployment. The city of Winnipeg, frorn which
I come, carries a debt of approximately $5
million or $6 million by reason of having had
to support its unemployed. I do not say that
the municipality should not help to support
these people, but I do say that Canada generally should be carrying its fair share of
that load. I am pleased to see $1,500,000 set
aside for this purpose; it indicates that the
federal
government is assuming some
responsibility.
I am pleased to note an item to provide full
sessional indemnity for those members of this
house who were absent during the 1949 sessions by reason of illness. Similar provision
is made for members of the House of
Commons.
I turn now to item 592, which I do not
criticize at all. It is a queer old world we
are living in. We heard the honourable
member from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon)
yesterday suggest a conference with Russia.
I admire his optimism; but if he believes that
such a thing is possible, I cannot say the same
of his judgment.
To my mind, it is
absolutely impossible. Within the next two
years we will either have to achieve peace or
fight another war, and we might as well face
it. Now we are spending hugs sums of money
to prepare ourselves for war, and I am not
going to vote against such an expenditure.
I should like to know whether all the flax
has yet been sold.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My information is that
it is being sold.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then we will have a similar
item in the estimates next year.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: To what item does my
friend refer?

been doing, we are going to lose everything
we have in it. It is easy enough to control
wheat when the world price is $2.50 a bushel,
and we pay the farmer $1.55, or when he gets
$1.75 a bushel and the world price is $3.35.
That is called stabilization. You can stabilize
any commodity as long as you get far enough
below the world price. In 1946 the price the
farmers received was 89 cents a bushel less
than the world price; in 1947, $1.33 less, last
year 21 cents less, and this year, I believe it
will be 20 cents less. But when the government tries to stabilizé flax by buying it at
$4 a bushel, that is a horse of a slightly different colour. Today we can buy butter, for
instance, at 58ï cents a pound; but the government is carrying 27 million pounds, and is
going to suffer a big loss on it. With a little
more oleomargarine we would have lost
everything. I am sorry my honourable friend
frorn Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is not here.
The government has been trying to violate
economic laws, and we see what the results
have been. By no conniving can they get
away from these laws. Perhaps it is all right
to say to the people of Canada that they must
pay $2.00 a bushel for wheat to be made into
flour, but to buy up surplus wheat is an
entirely different matter.
Some people may ask me: What about the
International Wheat Agreement? My answer
is that we cannot make Great Britain buy
wheat when she has not got the money to
pay for it. The same is true of all the
European countries that cannot afford to pay
for our wheat. Just the other day Japan sent
into Canada some shirts at about $1.40 each.
Hon. Mr. Grant: $1.35.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I stand corrected for five
cents. These were ordinary shirts, which
regularly sell in Canada for about $4.50. Now,
I do not blame the shirt manufacturers for
kicking; but how are we going to trade on a
world basis unless we are willing to accept
goods from other countries? Some honourable gentlemen may say to me: "You are a
Conservative; that is a funny doctripe to
preach". Well, I come from a part of the
country where such a doctrine is vital. Mr.
Hannam says that we should have stabilized
prices. Well, the United States have stabilized prices, but what is that country doing?
Just the other day a committee of the House
of
Representatives
voted
$1,900,000,000
instead of $2,900,000,000, and gave away a
billion dollars worth of goods. What happens
to us when they do that?

Hon. Mr. Haig: I am dealing now with
items 611, 612 and 613. As to the rapeseed
account, I did not know about it.
This all brings back to my mind an earlier
debate. I presume that if I were a member
of the House of Commons, and had to go back
to my people for re-election, I would not say
what I am about to say now; I predict that five
years from now the members of the other
house will be taking the same stand which
I now take, namely, that you cannot buck the
laws of economics. When we decide to take

wheat or any bther commodity, in large quanHon. Mr. Haig: Leave the economic laws

MARCH 24, 1950
favour of the wheat agreement, and contradicted me in this house when I said that at
the end of the four years we would get no
help. Well, so far we have got no help, and
today Britain has no rnoney to buy our wheat.
She can get her requirements cheaper on the
world market.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not wish to interrupt my friend unduly, or to do hirn any
injustice, but surely he is rnisrepresenting
rny view on the wheat agreement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I certainly arn not.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Oh yes, you are. I
was opposed to the wheat agreemnent, and I
said so quite definitely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Now will my friend sit
down? He has asked his question.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I just corrected a misstaternent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If my friend wants to make
a speech, let hlm go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I will sit down, but
first I want my friend to either quote the
statement I made regarding the wheat agreement or retract what he has said.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When we corne to the wheat
agreement I wiil show my honourable friend
what he said when I criticized buying wheat
at less than the mnarket price. My friend is
one of those who stood Up in this house and
said that in the end everything would be
adjusted. I said that Britain would not be
able to make any adjustrnent.
Hon. Mr. Lamnbert: I dispute the staternent
of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Britain is now talking about
opening up èbxchanges in order that world
mnarket prices may be kept down. That is
the first step. I now go to the second step.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Before my honourabie
frîend leaves the wheat question, may I ask
hirn on what authority he bases bis statement
that we are not going to get compensation
when the contract is over?
Han. Mr. Haig. Because Great Britain is
now trying to make deals with other countries.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What do you mean by
that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: She tried to make a deal
when she was told by the 'United States she
could have only so much money to buy goods,
and 15 million bushels of wheat were turned
down and the money diverted to sornething
else.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I do not; think my
honourable friend can say definitely that the
growers of wheat are not going to get compensation after the contract; is over.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Now you are making a
speech. If you want to talk, go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Beaubjen: I arn asking a question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I say to my honourable
frjend that that is the kind of talk he gave
me when the wheat agreement first came up,
and he will have to take it back as soon as the
four years are up. The wheat growers will
receive no consideration at ail for the $500
million they lost on the British wheat agreement. Great Britain could flot compensate
the farmers even if she wanted to.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The Minister of Trade
and Commerce in the other house made the
statement that the Wheat Board would pay on
the participation certificates at the end of four
years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but if my honourable
friend will look at the report on the wheat
agreement he will find that the board paid
out more money last May and June than it
had on hand. The account was overdrawn.
In order to provide for payments of 20 cents
per bushel the account was overdrawn by
$5,250,000.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Because the whole crop
was not sold.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If the honourabie senator
wants to make a speech, he can do so. He has
that right. But I did not interrupt him, and
I ask hlm. not to interrupt me. If he wants to
ask me a question, let him ask it. My words
hurt; but let hixn not get excited.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I ar n ot excited. You
are the one who is excited.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As I have said, and according to the report I have upstairs, the board,
by paying that 20 cents a bushel on the crops
for 1945 to 1948, overdrew their account by
over $5 million. That is what happened in
the wheat business.
I pass to the next item. It is one about
which there is some dispute, and I do not
think I shall say very much about it, because
Mr. Gordon, President of the Canadian
National Railways, has submitted to the Commission on Transportation a proposition to
write off- the debt owing by the corporation.
I do not know exactly what his recommendation is, and I do not want to anticipate it,
but the oniy difference it wiil make if adopted,
will be that the Canadian National Railways
as a corporation will not owe as much money
as they owe now, and the people of Canada
wiil owe just that much more. If in consequence of such an arrangement the Canadian
National Raiiway is relieved of its obligation,
the present charges of $42 million will disappear, but we shall have to put up all the

SENATE

interest on the billion dollars which the CNR
owes. The debt will not be wiped off; it will
still remain.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What about printing the
money?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We could do that, but I
don't believe in that kind of thing.
The second matter I want to speak about is
the estimate of $4,200,000 for the deficit of
Trans-Canada Air Lines and Trans-Canada
Atlantic Air Lines. It is very pleasant to ride
on TCA, as I did once, from Toronto to Bermuda and back, at the expense of the people
of Canada. It was a very nice ride. The
plane was not crowded. On the outward
journey there were
about twenty-five
passengers.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Why did you not go to
Japan?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was not asked, but I will
admit to my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) that had I been
invited I probably would have gone. It would
have been a very nice outing. I am told,
althoùgh I have never travelled that way,
that the plane trip from here to Winnipeg is
well worth while; so is the trip to Halifax.
An Hon. Senalor: At the expense of the
people of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I could ride there at the end
of this week on the air line if I wanted to.
Hon. Mr. Wood: Not on TCA.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, I could ride TCA to
Winnipeg and back. The honourable senator
from Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood) is a new member: he should watch us old fellows; he has
a lot to learn.
Hon. Mr. Wood: I am glad to know it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The information is free: I
charge my honourable friend nothing for it.
But I am not sure that the people of Canada
can afford extravagances of that kind. That
is all I have to say-that I am getting a little
uneasy about it. In a day or two the budget
will be down, and I assume that the Minister
of Finance will heavily reduce income tax
rates, make great slashes in our general taxation, and so forth.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is none left.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, I forgot: there is no
election this year.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is no taxation
lef t.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The items I have mentioned
are for luxuries; and with economic conditions as they are over a large part of the

world today I do not believe that government
enterprises can afford to operate in that
fashion. If private enterprise wants to try,
let it do so. I am not convinced that we are
going to make much out of this business. I am
sure that the Canadian Pacifie Railway is not
making any profit from its air enterprise on
the Pacifie. As to the position of the United
States air lines, I do not know; but they have
the advantage of serving a very large and
wealthy population within their own country.
To my mind the Trans-Canada Air Lines and
its Atlantic services are a luxury which we
cannot afford.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: Does the honourable
gentleman suggest that we should drop it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would drop it.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: Would he go back to
horse-and-buggy days?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I would travel by the
railways, as I have always done. I have
regularly travelled by the Canadian Pacific
and the Canadian National Railways. I have
just travelled by rail to Vancouver and back,
and I am still alive. It is true that the journey
took a day or two longer than if I had gone
by air, but my time is not worth very much,
and I had a very pleasant trip.
I have made these remarks because I feel
that taxation has become so heavy that unless
something is not done to curtail it we shall
have difficulties in the years ahead. I do not
believe that Canada or any other country
should carry on upon such standards when
other countries are on a basis of semi-starvation.

India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Egypt. Billions
of pounds are owed to these nations by Great
Britain which she cannot pay.
It is suggested that the United States
should assume the payments. I do not believe
they will do so. I honour the United States
for what they have done for the world. They
may have made mistakes, but they have tried
desperately to promote world recovery. However, there is a limit; their people are beginning to question relief expenditures; and, with
all modesty, I suggest that before the election
in the United States this year is over some
very plain things will be said about their
government's expenditures of money for this
purpose. Taxation powers to the extent of
$5 billion were denied the American Government last year, and it remains to be seen
what will happen to estimates of about the

MARCH 24, 1950
:same amount this year. How long can the
richest country in the world carry on upon
that scale? I do not know. Certainly it
cannot be sustained indefinitely.
In Canada, because of our high taxation, last
year closed with a surplus. Perhaps the
same thing will happen this year; I do not
know; but this much is evident, that tax
rates prevent any accumulation of money. It
is cheaper for some men to come down to this
house once a year and stay home the rest of
the time than it is for them to remain here the
full term. The income tax is so excessive that
it absorbs not only current earnings but what
some have saved in past years when others
were spending.
I do not speak without
authority.
Hon. Mr. Duff: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I entered my little town
of Winnipeg with $5 in my pocket, and I am
still living. I am not boasting when I say
that anything I have I earned myself, by
working every day.
Hon. Mr. Duff: And by saving.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are in Canada hundreds of thousands of men in exactly the same
boat as I am in. Of course most of them are
not senators.
Probably they would say,
"Haig, you should not worry; you have a
pension for life." Surely! But those people
are now from sixty to seventy years of age
and they are being taxed as though they had
never saved their money properly. That is
the effect of our tax structure. You say in
one breath that the people who earn the
money should carry the tax burden, and in
the next breath you say, "Well, so and so
deserves a much larger salary because he is
an able man"-and then you finally take it
all away from him. This system of taxation
is going to lead to difficulties. Here is one
place in the estimates where $4 million could
be saved-and who would be the loser? For
instance, very few of us travel by TCA, except
for those honourable senators who have to
journey all the way from Ottawa to British
Columbia. I admit that if I lived as far away
from here as they do, I too would make use
of the TCA; but the point is that this tremendous expenditure is not in the interest
of the economy of Canada. You may say that
I am a pessimist, but I think I am a realist.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: Well, do you realize more
people would be riding on the TCA if some
people kept their mouths shut?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never heard about any
person talking out of turn. My honourable
friend from Trenton may have heard about
it, but I never did. The point is that we
cannot afford to spend $4,200,000 in one year
on an experiment from which, in the final

stages; the only people to benefit will be those
who cannot afford to spend an extra two
days riding on a train. I think it was my
honourable friend from Trenton who yelled
at me about the horse-and-buggy days. Well,
both my father and grandfather rode in
horse-drawn buggies, and I am mighty proud
of them. They were decent people who paid
their debts and kept their word, and they
raised and educated their families in accordance with the educational system of the day.
I am deeply grateful to my father and grandfather for the fine heritage they passed on
to me, and I do not believe that when my
boy or your boy was serving overseas in
the armed forces it made much difference
to him whether his father travelled by airplane or not.
Our estimates for the year now total pretty
close to $2 billion 400 million. Twelve years
ago the estimates required by the same
government were less than $600 million, or
one-quarter of the present total. Now, this
increase cannot be totally attributed to interest on our war debt, nor can it be attributed
to the pay and allowances to our veterans.
The answer is that there has been a general
increase in expenditure all across the country.
I do not want to say anything about the
provinces because that is not my field, and
I would be criticized by them, but recent
press reports indicate that over the last twelve
years the expenditures of certain provincesI cannot say anything about Newfoundlandhave increased tremendously. Frankly, I do
not believe our people realize how we are
living and what the prospects are for the
future.
Honourable senators, I hope that next year
the estimates will be much less than they are
today; I also hope that during the coming
week, or a year from now, the Minister of
Finance will offer some plan to lessen expenditures and thereby decrease taxation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
there is one aspect of this bill to which I think
we should give some consideration. When
parliament assembled on January 26, 1949,
the main estimates for the current fiscal year
were tabled in the customary blue book, and,
because of the federal election, supplementary
estimates were brought down in the fall session. Now we are being asked to vote an
additional $65 million for the current fiscal
year. The point I wish to make is that when
what used to be called "extra supplementaries"-which were similar to what we are
voting here-were brought down, they were
based wholly.on extraordinary and unforeseen
expenditures. What bas happened in the
present instance, of course, is that this money

SENATE
has been practically all spent, through Governor General's warrants, I presume, and we
are now asked to vote an additional $65
million without-and I think this is important
It would
parliamentary approval.
-prior
seem that not only here but elsewhere
throughout the country we have almost completely revised our ideas on government
spending. Last year's main estimates, together
with the supplementaries voted last autumn
and these further supplementaries, bring the
total expenditure for the current fiscal year
close to $2 billion 400 million, which is a
very large sum.
The custom in the past was to appropriate,
by Governor General's warrants, extraordinary expenditures necessitated by disasters
such as floods or fires. We have departed
greatly from that practice, and I should like
to draw attention to a few of the items here.
It is true that the big item of $46,523,350 is
to cover the deficits of the Canadian National
Railways and the Trans-Canada Air Lines,
and so I think they may be accepted with
little criticism. Everyone was aware that
there were going to be deficits on the railroads
this year, and they knew they would have
to be met.
But let us take the first item the administration service of Agriculture. Here we are asked
to vote an additional $12,000 for the Publicity
and Extension Division. My contention is
that when the Department of Agriculture
calculated its estimates for the current year
it should have included, either in the main
estimates or in the supplementaries, all it
required for publicity and extension purposes.
The same argument applies to many of the
other items that appear in this list. Take
Citizenship and Immigration. An additional
vote of $100,000 is required for the welfare of
Indians. Since the supplementary estimates
were passed, some four or five months ago, has
there been any great emergency that requires
an additional vote of $100,000? I do not know
of any, and I do not believe there has been
any. It seems to me to be fair criticism te say
that the Indian Affairs Branch did not accurately foresee its needs. Or it may be that in
these days, when public money is spent so
easily, the branch thought another $100,000
could be obtained if it was asked for. The
money probably has been spent-I dare say it
has-but this is an unsound principle on which
to base our public finance. Except for extraordinary unforeseen needs, no money should
be spent by the government until it has been
voted by parliament.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If we get away from that
principle we shall be moving on to rather
dangerous ground.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: That is poor business.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The total amount asked for
by this bill is more than $65 million. If we
deduct the amounts required for the Canadian
National Railways and the Air Lines, there
remains a total of approximately $20 million,
made up of amounts asked for by the various

departments.

I do not like that, and I hope

that when the government brings down its
supplementaries in addition to the estimates
already tabled for the next fiscal year, it will
budget for what it requires and will not come
back to parliament later for approval of
expenditures that have been made before
being authorized by parliament. That is a
principle which we should keep firmly in
mind.
With the general remarks of the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) I find myself
I am alarmed-I was
in some sympathy.
almost going to say appalled-at the rate at
which our governing authorities of all kinds
are spending public money.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The amount of money
extracted from the Canadian people in taxes
today by ail governing authorities is not very

fa' below $4 billion. Now, on the basis of our
present national production and income we
could probably support that, but I wish to say
to this honourable house that if within the
next three or four years there should by any
chance be a drop of 20 or 25 per cent in our
national production and income-and we are
living in an uncertain world-we should be
faced with grave difficulties in the whole
field of public finance. Lenin, who was the
Irder in the establishment of the present
Russian Soviet republics, is on record as
having stated that one of the surest ways of
undermining the democratic capitalist system
was by bringing every possible kind of pressure on their government to spend money, so
as to cause them to chiher run into deficits
which have to be marie good by borrowing or
Io resort to heavy taxation. Eihher course has
dangerous implications for our de-nocratic
way of life.

It is not with any thought of criticism in my
mind that I make thee remarks; but I do
believe it is very important that we should
adhere to sound parliamentary practice in the
spending of public money.

Hon. James P. McIntyre: Honourable senators, before the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) had conc.luded his address I was

called out and so missed his last remarks, but
I did hear him saying that the people of
Canada could not stand the present taxation
imposed upon them by the government. The
honourable gentleman has now left the
chamber, but if he were here I would inform

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received communication from
the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Right
Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, acting as
Deputy of His Excellency the Governor
General, would proceed to the Senate Chamber this day at 5.45 p.m. for the purpose of
giving the Royal Assent to certain bills.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of Bill 15, an Act for granting to His
Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service of the financial year ending the 31st
March, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, before proceeding with my explanation, I wish to say
that if the honourable leader opposite desires
to discuss further the question which he has
just raised concerning unemployment insurance, he may do so on this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have not time to get the
information that I want.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
this is the interim supply bill, which is
brought before the house about this time
each year. Its passage would permit the
government to finance the public service for

the coming fiscal year, until the estimates
have been considered and a final supply
bill has been passed.
If honourable senators will turn to the
bill they will observe that its various sections
cover the different percentages asked.
Section 2 of the bill would grant $233,837,011.33. This is one-sixth of the main
estimates which have been laid before parliament, and is approximately two months'
supply. It will be noted that if the sum
asked is multiplied by six, the resulting
figure will be approximately $1 billion 500
million, which is less than the total supply
required. I would point out to honourable
senators that certain expenditures are statutory and are not voted specifically.
Section 3 of the bill would grant an
additional sum of $1,125,000. This is threequarters of the items set forth in schedule
"A" to this bill. Under the terms of union
of Newfoundland and Canada certain unemployment insurance payments fall due in
the first two months of the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1951, and this sum is required
to cover those payments.
Section 4 of the bill provides $1,900,666.66,
or one-third of the items listed in schedule
"B".
This additional amount is required
because there will be other expenditures
in these items during the early months of
the coming fiscal year.
Section 5 of the bill would vote $324,283.16,
or one-sixth of the items listed in schedule
"C". These items cover representation at
foreign conferences and administration costs
of the Senate and the House of Commons.
Certain foreign conferences are to be held
in the early months of this year, and this
item would provide for Canadian representation. The main administrative costs of the
Senate and the House of Commons are
incurred when both houses are sitting during
the first part of each year.
Section 6 would vote $2,614,658.75, or
one-twelfth of the items set out in schedule
"D". This amount is required because expenditures under these items are heaviest
in the spring months.
No part of this bill would vote the total
amount of any item in the main estimates,
and of course I give the usual undertaking
that the passage of this bill will in no way
prejudice the right of any honourable senator to discuss any item in the estimates
when those estimates are before a committee
of this bouse or the bouse itself.
Hon. Mr. Duff: That is satisfactory.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL

WITHDRAWAL OF MEMBER FROM COMMITTEE

Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Before the Orders of the
Day are called, I rise to a question of privilege. It has to do 'with a speech which was
delivered in this house on Monday night of
last week. I realize that I should have
brought up the question immediately afterwards, but the honourable senator who
delivered the address has not been in the
house since, until this evening, and in his
absence I would not raise the question. I
refer to the speech which was delivered by
the honourable senator for Toronto-Trinity

the reason for my interest. I am a Liberal. The
first principle of Liberalism is respect for the rights
of the individual. The dangers which the world
is facing today flow from two opposite sources:
privilege, as promoted by those on the right, and
socialistic worship of the state to the utter disregard
of the rights of the individual, as promoted by those
Old-time Tory privilege, with its

assumptions of superiority by some over the mass
of mankind, with its landlordism, its claim to
ownership of the gifts of nature, its denial of
equality, both econonical and political, is bad
enough . . .

Not was bad enough, but is bad enough.
. . . God knows; but I doubt whether this side of
the story is as bad as the other side. This attitude
of privilege has cursed the world with tyranny,
oppression, untold poverty, cruelty, and woe . . .

Honourable senators, if those words had
been used in the course of a controversial

it pretty strong language. But I take very
strong exception to the use of this language
by one who is setting Up a committee on

moment that there was anything personal in

I know what was in his mind and what his
explanation would be; but in my opinion there
is no explanation for so biased and partisan
an approach.
I could not act on a committee the approach
to which bas been couched in these words, and

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

stili have a few words to add. If I have
resented so much the remarks of the bonourable senator, it is because, Mr. Speaker, the
French I speak, which may not be found
perfect, I have learned it on my Acadian
mother's knees. Further during the seven or
eight trips I bave made to France-I amrnfot
speaking out of vanity but out of legitimate
pride-I have had the opportunity to speak
ulongside French speakers who, I admit in
all humility, in no way made me feel inferior
to them. What I am saying for rnyself, I could
say with greater reason for ten, fifteen, twenty
or a hundred of my compatriots whio have
given lectures at the Sorbonne or throughout
France. I dare not name any, lest I forget
some.
Let me tell you a story. Quite a long time
ago, when I was Secretary of the Province of
Quebec, a professor of the University of
Oxford, a very smart and erudite Englishman
who spoke, I believe, a better French than the
honourable senator from. Calgary, came to see
me in Quebec city. After we had discussed
many questions-education, language-I took
the liberty of asking him what hie thought

of the English spoken in Canada. Mr. Speaker,
I ask your permission not; to repeat bis answer.
If my honourable friend fromn Calgary
wishes to bear patois, I wiil tell bim where to
go. It is not difficult. Let him go to France,
to certain parts of Brittany, Provence and
Auvergne, to Marseilles, to the country of the
Basques or to Alsace, and hie will surely not
understand some of the French that i5 spokeni
there.
1 say, convinced that my statement cannot
be coitradicted, that a Frenchman who travels
across Canada, from east to west and from
north to soutb, will make bîmself understood
and will understand the French spoken by
Frencb-Canadians or Acadians.
Srne Hon. Senators: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. David: I do not wish to prolong
this statement of facts unnecessarily. 1 wish
to point out, however, that if our French is s0
poor a protest will bave to be made to the
government of the province of Ontario whicb
bas for some years entrusted to French Canadians the teacbing of French in its bigh
schools. I do not; understand how the pro-'ince
of Ontario would tolerate the teacbing of a
patois in its sehools.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. David: I arn about to conclude, but
another incident deserves to be mentioned. It
was on the occasion of a lecture given by Mr.
Labori, an attorney in the Dreyfus case wbich
bad divided France. I was talldng. with Mr.
Labori after bis lecture wben an old lady told
hlm in a language which was neither French
nor Englisb: "You know, sir, we understand.
ail tbat you say, but the French Canadians,
here, I do not understand tbem; for I learned
French in Paris". Turning bis bead towards
me, Mr. Labori asked: "What is she saying?"
There is in tbis house at least one Englisbspeaking senator who speaks French both correctiy and fiuently, and since he understands
it well, I arn sure hie did not miss a single
word of the remarks made in French by the
senator from Gloucester (Hon. M. Veniot). I
amn speaking of the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
That is the difference between the one who
knows a language and is able to speak it and
the one wbo does not know it and dares to
mention it. And, as my final word, I say that
every English-speaking person who does not
understand French sbould at least refrain
frorn making sucb unfair and uncalled for
remarks.

(Text):
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES POWER
COMMISSION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill T2, an Act to amend the
Northwest Territories Power Commission Act.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that in the year 1948 parliament passed a
statute, being chapter 64 of the statutes of
that year, respecting the supplying of electric
power in the Northwest Territories. This
bill has for its sole object the extension of the
application of that Act to the Yukon Territory.
Perhaps honourable senators will be interested to know what progress has been made
in the construction of power plants in the
Northwest Territories since the Act was
passed, under the powers conferred on the
commission set up by that measure.
Since October 1948 the commission has
operated, on a self-sustaining basis, a hydro
electric power development on the Snare
River; 94 miles northwest of Yellowknife,
and now supplies power to gold mines at
Yellowknife, and to the Yellowknife Power
Company Limited for distribution in the town
of Yellowknife. Power is supplied at a price
calculated to meet operating and maintenance costs and interest charges on capital
investment, and to amortize the capital cost
over a period of twenty years.
At the present time the commission is constructing, and will have in operation during
the present year, a second plant to provide
diesel-generated electric power at Fort Smith,
in the Northwest Territories, which will supply electric power on a self-sustaining basis
to the town of Fort Smith and to the various
federal government establishments located
there. A similar plant is being constructed at
Hay River, in the Northwest Territories, and
it is expected that it also will be in operation
before the end of the present year.
During 1949 surveys and investigations
were carried out on behalf of the government
to determine the feasibility of hydro electric
power development on the Mayo river, in
Yukon Territory, and consideration is now
being given to the construction of a hydro
electric plant on that river. This project,
which would provide an initial development
of 4,000 horsepower, with provision made in
the dam and hydraulic tunnel for an additional 2,000 horsepower, would cost approximately $3 million. This sum includes the cost
of constructing a twenty-seven-mile transmis-

sion line from the power site to the property
of United Keno Hill Mines Limited.
The purpose of this bill is to extend the
application of the Northwest Territories
Power Commission Act to the Yukon Territory, and thus enable the commission to
render in the Yukon Territory a service
similar to that in the Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Will the cost of this
extension to the Yukon Territory be paid
entirely by the government?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In the first instance, of
course, the money for the construction of the
plant will be provided by the government.
But I understand that, as has been the case
with the other developments which have been
undertaken under this Act, power contracts
will be entered into under which the power
will be paid for by the consumers, mostly
mining companies, at a rate which within a
reasonable period will amortize the cost of
the construction of the plant.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If any honourable
senators wish to obtain further information on
this matter, the bill can go to a standing committee. If not, as it is quite a simple bill,
perhaps it could be given third reading. In
this matter I am entirely in the hands of the
house.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is quite an important
bill. I think it should go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I suggest that it would
be useful to have it referred to a committee,
where we could usefully get information
as to whether adequate amounts for maintenance and depreciation are charged against the
earnings of the plant. Sometimes government enterprises of this kind have a way of
travelling along rather easily. I think it would
be a useful check, in order to ascertain
what it has cost, how it is operating and
whether there is a fair prospect of it continuing to operate profitably in the future.
I am particularly interested in acquiring
some further information on the proposal to
establish a diesel electric light plant at Fort
Smith. All this information would be useful
to the members of the bouse, and could be
obtained in committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If it is the desire of
the Senate, I shall be glad to have the bill
go to committee. As the Committee on
Transport and Communications is meeting

Communications.

to be sent to committee, I shaîl be glad to
so move; but as it seems to be a simple bull,
I would move third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
SPEECH FIHOM THE THEONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

PRECIOUS METALS MARKING BILL
SECOND R~EADING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved second reading
of Bill U-2, an Act to amend the Precious
Metals Marking Act, 1946.
He said: Honourable senators, the sole
purpose of thîs bill is to amend the Precious
Metals Marking Act of 1946, so as to include
within its provisions a precious metal known
as palladium. I am informed that palladium
is a white metallic element of the platinum
group. In its pure state, it is malleable and
ductile, and is slightly harder than gold or
platinum. It can be hardened for jewellery
manufacture by the addition of small amounts
of another metal, usually ruthenium and
this produces an all-platinum metal alloy
that is wear-resisting, has the strength and
toughness to retain gems permanently, is
highly resistant to tarnish, and will retain
a brilliant polish. This metal seems to have
all the best qualities.
Hon. Mr. Leger: Is it found in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is a derivative of
platinum. The original Act, known as the
Gold and Silver Stamping Act, was passed
in 1906, and applied only to gold and silver.
In 1928 the Act was amended to include
platinum, and, with the coming into marketability of this new metal, it is now sought
to amend the Act again so as to include
palladium as one of the precious metals
subject to its provisions.
I might add for the information of honourable members that this amendment has the
endorsation of the Canadian Jewellers'
Association.
Han. Mr. Crerar: Can the honourable senator give us some idea as to what this new
metal is worth?
Han. Mr. Hugessen: I a-n afraid I am unable
to do that; but I assume that as it is in the
range of platinumn it is a valuable metal.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

On the Order:
Resumlng the adjourned debate on the motion of
the Honourable Senator Golding, seconded by the
H-onourable Senator Veniot, that an humble Address
be presented to Hjs Excellency the Governor General
for the gracious Speech which he has been pleased
to deliver bo both Houses of Parliament.- (Hon.
Senatcr Horner).

Han. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, it
was my intention, when I adjourned the
debate, to adjourn it until Tuesday. However, I understand that the honourable the
junior senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
MeKeen) wishes to speak this evening, and
I am quite wihhing to give him *my place so
long as I am allowed to again adjourn the
debate until tomorrow.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Agreed.
The Senate resumed from March 23, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for an
Address in reply thereto.
Han. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators, I
was rather shocked into entering this debate.
The other day the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) suggested that we
should drop the TCA. His proposal hit me
rather bard, but on thinking it over I have
come to believe he was not too serious. He
has a way of someti-mes "needling" government supporters, thereby encouraging them
to get up on their feet and tell the country
what a good government it has. Perhaps that
was his motive when he said that we should
drop the TCA.
Same Hon. Senalars: Oh, oh.
Han. Mr. McKeen: Transportation
is
extremely important to any country. This
is particularly true of Canada, so with the
indulgence of the Senate I shahl deal lightly
with the early history of British Columbia. I
hope my colleagues from Newfoundland will
not laugh at the comparatively recent dates
of the discoveries of our province, for our
history does not go back more than a couple

SENATE
the first traveller to reach the west coast was
a Chinese monk. The dates of his travels are
unknown, but in China there is an old record
of a monk who journeyed east and crossed
a body of water, which was probably Bering
Strait, and then travelled south to find some
huge trees. His description of these trees fits
the Douglas fir offBritish Columbia, Oregon
and Washington. Then the record describes
a tree similar to the California redwood, he
must have travelled pretty well down the
coast. There is nothing in our own history
about this; perhaps it is just a legend.
Along about 1778, less than two hundred
years ago, Captain Cook came upon the
Pacific coast while travelling east in search
of the Northwest Passage. Prior to this time
all explorers had sailed westward to find the
Northwest Passage. His venture was a most
important one as far as the British government was concerned, because they had offered
a prize of £100,000 to the discoverer of the
Northwest Passage, and a smaller prize of
£5,000 to the explorer who got within a few
degrees of the North Pole. Captain Cook
landed on the west coast of Vancouver Island
at a place now called Nootka Inlet, and he
told about the sea otter and other fur-bearing
animals that he saw. The result was that a
few years later a fur-trading station was set
up in Nootka Sound. English traders loaded
their ships here with furs, and soon commenced bartering them in China for silks,
tea, spices and other oriental produce, after

which the ships returned to England. British
Columbia lacked overland transportation, and
in 1788 or thereabouts an export trade by
water was opened up.
The next discoverer of British Columbia
was Captain George Vancouver, Who made
an accurate chart of the coast in 1792. The
big island off the mainland was named after
him in his honour, as were two coastal cities.
One of these, the original Vancouver, is in
the State of Washington. It is 100 years old,
and celebrated its one-hundredth anniversary
when Vancouver, B.C. was celebrating its
sixtieth anniversary.
The next explorer to journey to the far
western province was Alexander Mackenzie,
the first man to reach the Pacific coast by the
overland route.
As honourable senators
know, the early explorers were racing to
establish fur-trading posts on the west coast.
When they got beyond Winnipeg, because
they could not make the trip back to Montreal
in one year, they had to carry their stock of
furs for two years. Some of the companies,
not having sufficient money to finance themselves for two years, ran into trouble. They
were in a worse plight than the prairie
farmers today who have to carry over for one
year.

Mackenzie was soon followed by Lewis and
Clark, on the American side, who came up
from the Missouri river and arrived at the
mouth of the Columbia river in 1803. The
Canadian fur traders, hearing that Lewis and
Clark were coming, thought they would try to
get ahead of them, but were a little late. They
arranged with Simon Fraser to endeavour to
get to the mouth of the Columbia river in
advance of Lewis and Clark. He got to the
mouth of a river all right, but it was not the
Columbia. The river he reached is the one
which now bears his name, the Fraser river,
which is some 300 miles north of the Columbia.
Fraser was quite disappointed to find that he
had not arrived at the Columbia river, but
he had done a goodjob of exploration for
Canada, and blazed a trail for the fur traders
going out there.
In about the year 1811 John Jacob Astor,
who was then the fur king of New York,
thought he would get into the fur trade on
the West Coast. Being a very smart business
man he established, at the mouth of the
Columbia river, a trading post called Astoria,
a thriving town which is still there. His
actions revealed his business ingenuity. The
site that he chose for the post was at that time
supposed to be on Brtiish territory, and
England sent out a sloop of war to take over
the fort that he had erected. But before the
sloop arrived, Astor sold the fort to the
Canadians. He did very well out of this,
because he got his money, and the fort was
later handed back by the British.
The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1818 between
the United States and Britain, neglected to
specify the southern border on the West Coast,
and we had a squabble in trying to decide
where it should be. Finally the matter was
settled. The original border ran down to
the Columbia river. One of the arbitrators,
an Englishman, said that as the salmon on the
Fraser river would not rise to a fly, the territory there was not worth keeping, anyway,
and should be given to the Americans. So they
got the line north of the Columbia river up to
the forty-ninth parallel. A peculiar clause was
inserted in the treaty and is still in force. It
provides that any Canadian citizen-a trader
or anyone else-can navigate up and down the
Columbia river, through American territory,
without any let or hindrance from the customs
authorities. If that had been known during
the rum-running days in California and
Oregon, I am afraid the American authorities
would have had a good deal of trouble with
people wanting to run rum through the city
of Portland, through which city the river
flows.
In 1836, to provide better transportation on
the coast, the Hudson's Bay Company sent out
from England a vessel called the Beaver, the

MARCH 27, 1950
first steamship to ply the Pacifie Ocean. As a
matter of fact, she did not carry enough fuel
to complete the voyage, and came around the
Horn under sail. On arriving at the mouth of
the Columbia river she took on board some
cordwood from the banks of the Columbia,
shipped ber paddles, and proceeded up the
coast under ber own steam, right to Victoria,
out of which port she operated for the
Hudson's Bay Company. Later on she was
wrecked on the shores of Vancouver, and
ber old timbers, pretty well disintegrated
by now, lie on the rocks there. Our good
friend the senator from Huron-Perth (Hon.
Mr. Golding) was presented by the former
Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Honourable Mackenzie King, with a gavel made out
of one of the timbers of the old Beaver.
There was trouble about not only the southern border, but also the northern boundary
line. As honourable senators know, the
United States bought Alaska from Russia.
Opponents of the purchase said it was a very
poor piece of business, but it bas paid off many
times since. The boundary line of the Alaska
coast was drawn down to the coast line of
British Columbia, but one of the members of
the Boundary Commission strongly objected to
this and, rather than sign the treaty confirming
that boundary, resigned from the commission.
That gentleman is still alive, and is today one
of the members of this house, the honourable
gentleman from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Shortly after the 1849
gold strike in Southern California there was
a strike in British Columbia, and large numbers -of American miners and prospectors
came up there. In 1864 there were on the
coast two separate colonies, one called
British Columbia and the other, Vancouver.
But they ran into financial difficulties and
decided that the only way to save themselves
from bankruptcy was to unite, which they
did, in 1866, under the name of British
Columbia. At that time the population was
12,000. Immediately a move was made to
join up with the eastern colonies, which were
then attempting to form confederation. The
chief obstacle to the union of British Columbia with the eastern part of the country at
that time was lack of transportation. The
only way then to get from British Columbia
to, say, Central Canada, was by way of the
coast down to San Francisco, thence by
stage coach to Chicago, and from there into
Canada.
Because of the unbridged rivers and mountainous territory in the British Columbia of
those days, the miners could not get very far
or make much speed with the horse and

buggy. The early miners had to carve trails
out of the mountain side. The Cariboo Trail,
which was a famous route built by the Royal
Engineers, was used by pack trains, some
wagons and even by camel teams. The camels,
however, were not a very successful means of
transportation, because they frightened the
horses, which often bolted and lost their
cargoes over the cliffs. Besides, most of the
people, rough and ready though they were,
objected to the smell of the camels.
As I have said, no sooner were the two
colonies united in 1866 than there was a
movement started to join with the rest of the
country. Their price for confederating was a
good method of transportation linking the
Pacifie coast with the East. That meant a
wagon road, plus a railroad. It is rather noteworthy that in the same year there was a bill
introduced in the Congress of the United
States to annex the territory north of the
49th parallel. I do not think the bill ever
passed; certainly there was never an attempt
to put it into effect. There was considerable
agitation in this coastal area and many
people there, as in the Maritimes, did not
want to join Canada; but the majority were
in favour of it, and an arrangement was
entered into whereby the wagon road was to
be completed within two or three years and
the railway was to be started within two
years and completed within ten years. On
these terms British Columbia came into confederation. Actually the railway was not
completed until 1885.
When air travel came into being it was
looked upon by the people of British Columbia as the finest form of travel yet devised.
As a matter of fact, the only way one can
travel up the coast of that province is by ship,
either in the air or on the water. With all
the inlets and indentations in the coast line it
is impossible to build a railway or a roadway
along most of the shore line; and the roads,
when built, will have to be constructed well
inland, with lateral roads leading to the
coastal towns and cities. So for the opening
up of a considerable part of the coastal area
we are dependent upon the use of air ships
and sea-going ships.
When at last there was an opportunity for
the formation of an air line British Columbia
was very much interested. There were many
small companies formed in that area for local
lines, the first of which was between Vancouver and Victoria.
In 1937 the Right Honourable C. D. Howe
exercised courage and foresight in launching
a programme to provide a system of air
transportation that he knew was needed
in this country. He introduced in the other
bouse a bill incorporating Trans-Canada

SENATE
Airlines. The original discussions were with
the two railways, and for a time it looken
as if the C.P.R. would participate in the
project. At the last moment, however, Sir
Edward Beatty, head of that railway, decided
against the move, and the Canadian National
Railways alone went along with the T.C.A.,
which was incorporated in the year 1937.
In the spring of that year the first route,
between Vancouver and Seattle, started
operating, making the line international from
the start. Operation across Canada followed
shortly afterwards, along with branch lines
throughout the country; but I think it was
not until 1938 that the first trans-continental
mail was carried.
I recall that in February of 1939 our
present Minister of Fisheries, the Honourable
R. W. Mayhew, from British Columbia, was
very active in trying to get mail-carrying
services extended to Victoria. He was told
at the time that there was not sufficient
mail to warrant such a line. He put up
some persuasive arguments-as a matter of
fact, I believe he bet a hat that the line would
carry twice as much mail as the post office
said it would-and the line was put in
operation. It was a success right from the
start. In February 1939 Mr. Mayhew was
the first passenger to fly from the East to
the West Coast, and I think in May of that
year the regular transcontinental passenger
service was started.
In May of 1943 a trans-Atlantic service
was put into operation, and during the war
the TCA was asked to take over this service
for the government, carrying priority passengers and mail. It operated in that manner
until 1947, when the trans-Atlantic line was
turned over to the control of TCA. In May
of the year 1948 the service was extended
to Bermuda, and in December of that year
to Trinidad and Nassau. I think the planes
now stop at Florida, but that is quite a recent
development.
When the first route was operated between
Vancouver and Seattle the daily distance
flown was only 122 miles; today the total
daily mileage is 16,000 miles. The TCA
fleet ai the end of 1945 consisted of 28 aircraft, with a carrying capacity of 369
passengers; today it is 47 planes, with a
capacity of 1388 passengers. When the transcontinental run was started in 1938, there
were two planes east and west daily; in
1949 this number was increased to three
planes daily; and in May of this year a
fourth trip will be added. This fourth plane
will eut an hour off the regular flying time.
A traveller may leave Vancouver at about
10:55 a.m.. Toronto time, and arrive in To-

ronto at 8:10 that evening, a total travelling
time of about nine hours.
It is interesting to note the saving of time
resulting from non-stop flights. On the new
run Trans-Canada planes will operate nonstop from Toronto to Winnipeg, and from
Winnipeg to Vancouver.
To indicate the
speed that can be attained on such a flight,
I would point out that the first North Star
required, from the take-off in Vancouver
until the landing in Montreal, a total elapsed
time of six hours and fifty-two minutesan average speed of 350 miles an hour.
That is probably as fast as the jets will travel
on commercial schedules to start with.
To indicate how important air travel is to
British Columbia, I would point out that
last year the Vancouver airport handled
339,900 passengers, many of whom came
from all parts of the world.
I corne now to the question of the cost
of operating the Trans-Canada Airlines, and
particularly this year's deficit of $4 million,
which need never have occurred. The
government has taken a strong hand in the
operation of the TCA, and the low-paid contracts with the post office department have
brought about a defieit. Costs of operation
have been going up along with everything
else, but at the same time the revenue for
carrying mail has been drastically reduced.
As honourable senators know, Canada is the
only country where one can send mail by
air for regular postage. It is not the government that is paying for this service, but the
TCA. In 1940 the mail rate per ton mile was
$6.35; in 1949 the rate was $1.59. By a little
calculation one can readily see that had
the 1940 rates been in force last year the
TCA would have had revenue from mail
contracts of $21 million instead of $5,400,000.
Even if the rate of three years ago had
been maintained, the line would have had
a revenue from mail carriage of about $10
million, and the operation would aI least
have broken even.
But that is only part of the story. In 1949
the increase in ton-mile revenue was 16 per
cent, and the amount of mail carried for that
revenue was 48 per cent more. On the other
hand, the number of passengers carried was
22 per cent greater than in the previous year,
revenue passenger miles were up 24 per cent
and the entire revenue obtained from this
source was up 31 per cent. So the passengers
are paying a considerable increase, and the
people who are using air mail for letters and
parcels are doing so at the cost of regular
mail. In other words, passenger traffic has
not derived any advantage from the additional
payment of $4 million to the air lines.

MARCH 27, 1950
Hon. Mr. Howden: Where is the rail revenue
going, then? The rates have never changed.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The revenue has been
absorbed by lower charges for mail. Mail is
being sent by air as cheaply as by surface
transport. That is, all letters weighing an
ounce or less are carried by air.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Sometimes it goes that
way.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Well, it goes that way
if air service will save any time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it does not.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: But the tonnage is
greater. I have the figures. In 1949 it represented 3,403,800 ton miles, an increase of 48
per cent over the previous year, but the rate
per ton mile fell from $2.03 in 1948 to $1.59
last year. I challenge honourable senators
to point to any other transportation company
which can show such a reduction of rates.
The railway companies have not been dropping their rates, nor have the steamships
done so. But air lines charges are fixed by
the postal authorities. I might mention that
an appeal with a view of obtdfflng a fair rate
is now before the postal department. Had
the rates of 1940 been in effect last year there
would have been a surplus of $11 million, or
more than sufficient to wipe out the present
deficit.
But this again is only part of the story.
Among the sources which provide revenue to
the government are: deductions from payroll
amounting to $1,074,000; interest charges,
taxes and landing fees of approximately $3
million, $467,000 of which is accounted for by
landing fees alone. I understand that over
$150 must be paid every time one of these
North Stars lands on an airfield. Taxes on
gasoline amount to $142,000. Aircraft parts
and spares are imported at charges ranging
from 30 to 35 per cent higher than those prevailing in the United States; and from this
source the government obtains the customs
charge. So judging from this standpoint, it
is evident that the government is not losing
money on TCA.
Another angle to which I would draw attention is this. TCA bought North Star ships
from Canadair, and these ships are equal to
any airships elsewhere. Their safety record
is excelled by none.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Is there any breakdown
as between the trans-Atlantic service and
service on the continent?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Yes; I can give that
information. The figures I have cited relate
to domestic operations only, but the report
tabled here this evening gives the figures on
trans-Atlantic service. TCA losses, according to their bookkeeping, are $1,419,444 on the
55950-12

domestic lines, and $2,898,149 on the Trans
Canada Air Lines (Atlantic) Ltd. The big
deficit is on the trans-Atlantic run.
While I am on this subject I will mention
something which I think the government
should do. CPA, which has bought North
Star planes, is pioneering the run to Hong
Kong and out to Australia and the rates which
they are allowed to charge for that run are
set, not by them alone, but by all the air
lines. At the beginning of their operations
they cannot possibly carry on this servicewhich is for the benefit of Canada-without
loss, and I believe that since the governmént
itself is not running a service across the
Pacific, it should take into account the value
of this operation in keeping Canada to the
fore-at great expense to CPA-and subsidize
the line. If air lines are not maintained we
shall lose out in world trade. We have found
by experience that it is a disadvantage not
to have steamships to carry our freight, particularly such products as lumber. Those
who control the ships control to a certain
extent the trade. Private enterprise might
reasonably have shied away from transPacific operations, which looked like unprofitable business, at any rate for a while; but the
private air lines have in this respect proved
their worth, and I think they should receive
some government support.
I have already referred to Canadair. A
large plant has been built in Canada, and to
show that it is not kept going solely by TCA
and CPA, I may mention that the biggest
order they have had was from BOAC, to
whom they sold twenty-four planes. These
planes are fiying all around the world. In this
connection I should like to mention a circumstance which is of particular interest to
us in British Columbia, and would be also,
I think, of interest to others. A few weeks
ago our minister from British Columbia, Honourable R. W. Mayhew, had occasion to go to
conferences in India and Ceylon. From
Victoria he flew on a North Star aircraft to
Montreal, and then to London. If he had
waited another day to go from Lon'don to
Cairo he could have taken a North Star in
the service of the BOAC, but the schedule
was unsuitable, so he took a Constellation.
However, he was again on a North Star-that
is, a Canadian-built plane-from Cairo to
Bombay. From Bombay to Hyderabad, from
Hyderabad to Bangalore, and thence to
Madras and to Colombo he rode in small airplanes of another type, either Deccans or Air
Salons. He was again in a North Star from
Colombo to Karachi, and thence to Delhi,
from Delhi to Singapore via Rangoon, from
Singapore to Hong Kong, Hong Kong to
Tokio, Tokio to Honolulu, and Honolulu to
San Francisco, where he took an Australian

SENATE

plane to Victoria. Had he wanted to, he
could have gone to Australia, and stayed on a
North Star ship on commercial air lines right
from Victoria, clear around the world, back
to Victoria again. That shows the dependability of these North Star ships which are
made here in Canada.
There is another aircraft factory in Toronto,
the Avro plant. They have a jet transport
plane which is superior to anything on this
continent. They are ahead of the United
States in this field; and although the United
Kingdom is building a Comet for transAtlantic flight, and the Avro plane cannot
cover the distances for which the British
plane is designed, so far the results obtained
from the Avro have been as satisfactory as,
if not more so than, those obtained by the
Comet. The main difficulty at Avro at the
moment is economic. Before this type of
plane can be used in commercial work that
problem must be solved.
In the trips taken by Honourable Mr.
Mayhew to and from these two conferences
he travelled 151 hours, flying a distance of
31,000 miles. Of this flight 136 hours were
in a North Star. It may be of interest to add
that he was accompanied by Mrs. Mayhew,
who of course, as a passenger, paid her own
way. Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew were in Ceylon,
where their son was lost during the war while
serving in the R.C.A.F., and they were able
while on the island to go to an airfield and
see where he was stationed at the time of his
death. It was a most touching part of the
trip, and it was particularly fortunate that
they could go there at that time, because a
month or so later the station was torn down.
Mrs. Mayhew accompanied her husband all
the way, and they never missed a meal or lost
one on the whole trip. These people had no
qualms about safety, and their trip illustrates
how easily one can travel around the world
these days.
Air transportation has a splendid record
and is extremely useful in shortening our
boundaries and bringing our people together.
Commencing next Monday, a person may
travel from Vancouver to Toronto, as I have
said, in only nine hours; so I think the
argument in favour of paying $4 million or
of giving a little more subsidy to the air line
is a pretty good one. If my case has not been
well enough argued, I have a few more computations which I think may interest honourable senators.
Last year the TCA carried approximately
690,000 passengers. Now, providing that the
average earning power of each of those passengers was $10 a day and, providing further
that each of them was able to save one day's

travelling time by flying, the total amount
saved would be approximately $7 million.
Because vital parts have been unobtainable
or machinery has broken down factories have
been shut down and workers have been laid
off; but aircraft could load up in Montreal
one day and deliver the next day in
Vancouver.
Another point is that right now in British
Columbia we have some beautiful spring
flowers.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Last year the TCA flew
125,000 pounds of cut flowers to the East, and
people here were able to buy daffodils at
35 cents a dozen whereas they formerly paid
$2 a dozen. This meant the building up of
this industry in British Columbia, and far
westerners were thus able to get back some
of the money they paid out for automobiles,
textiles, radios, refrigerators, and so on, purchased from the East. I understand that last
year something in the neighbourhood of
60.000 pounds of lobsters were flown from
Yarmouth to Boston. The Right Honourable
C. D. Howe has had a book published on
Newfoundland, and in it I read that aircraft
are picking up lobster and other fish there
and flying them to the United States market.
When, in June 1948, floods in British Columbia blocked the railroads, TCA handled
600,000 pounds of cargo; and again, in January 1950, when the railways were blocked by
snow slides, TCA, in addition to handling its
own regular cargoes, flew 50,000 pounds of
cargo to Calgary.
Honourable senators, we cannot afford to
dispense with this kind of service. We need it
in this country. British Columbia came into
confederation in the first place on the understanding that it would be brought closer to
the rest of Canada through a modern up-todate system of transportation. We want to
keep the TCA running.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Horner, the debate
was adjourned.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 16, an Act to amend the Agricultural Products Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I think I
must first apologize for the form in which
this bill comes before us. It has been distributed to members in the form in which it
received first reading in the other place. I
am advised that the Printing Bureau was
unable to get the bill ready in third reading
form in time for distribution to us now, but as
the bill was not amended in the other place,
the form in which you now have it on your
desks is really the sarne as the form in which
it passed the House of Commons.
Honourable senators, the bill is a simple one
consisting of a single clause. Its purpose is
to amend the Agricultural Products Act,
which expires on March 31 of this year, in
such a way that it will not expire until March
31, 1951.
Honourable members will recall that the
Agricultural Products Act was first passed
by this parliament in 1947, and was adopted
for the purpose of enabling the government
to negotiate and carry out contracts with other
countries for the sale of agricultural products
other than wheat. The Act as passed in 1947
provided for the setting up of commodity
boards to attend to the marketing of the particular products in respect of which contracts
might be entered into. It gave power to the
government to require the shipment or
delivery of agricultural products in order to
fulfil contracts which might have been entered
into. By its terms the Act as originally introduced expired on March 31, 1948. Since that
time it has twice been extended: once in the
session of 1948 and once in the session of
1949, and on each occasion the extension was
for a period of one year. The bill now before
us provides for a further extension of one
year.
I may say for the information of honourable
members that at the present time there are
only two food contracts now in operation
under the Act, and both of these are with the
government of Great Britain. The first is a
pork products contract covering the sale
of 60 million pounds of pork and bacon
at 32j cents per pound. That contract is
55950-12J

administered by the Meat Board, which is one
of the commodity boards set up under the Act.
The second is a cheese contract providing for
the sale of 85 million pounds of cheese at a
price of 25 cents per pound. That is the price
which the British government pays. There is
also a bonus of 3 cents per pound which the
Governor in Council pays to the producer.
This cheese contract is administered by the
Dairy Products Board. Both of these contracts were entered into for the current year,
1950, but I am informed that it is altogether
probable that they will both have been cornpleted considerably before the end of the
current year.
There are two basic reasons for the enactment of this legislation. The first is to continue the statutory sanction for the carrying
out of the two existing agreements to which
I have just referred; the second is to enable
the Governor in Council to negotiate new
agreements for future years, if it should be
found possible and advantageous to do so.
There is one consideration which I think
honourable senators should bear in mind. It
is a truism, of course, to say that in the past
the historical market for many of our agricultural products bas been in Great Britain;
and we hope that that situation will continue
in the future. The present British government is wedded to the idea of bulk purchases
by one government from another, and is
reluctant to deal with private sources of
supply. In fact, I am advised that this is so
much the case that it is extremely doubtful
whether Great Britain would have bought any
Canadian pork products this year, had it not
been for the fact that under this legislation
our government had the power to enter into
a contract with the British goverrnment. And
that constitutes, perhaps, a further reason
why the continuation of this Act is advisable.
I do not think there is anything further
that I need say in explanation of the bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
normally I would not be in favour of selling
and buying by the government. I do not think
the world will ever get back on its feet until
we resume the old system of trading, whereby
individuals in one nation sell to individuals
in another. -However, we have entered into
two contracts under this legislation, and they
could not be carried out unless this bill was
passed. I presume the bouse knows that in
both contracts we are bonusing the Canadian
producer. To that principle I am desperately
opposed.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think that leads inevitably
to disaster. The United States furnishes perhaps the best possible example of the terrific

SENATE
load that has to be carried by a country which
buys food products from its Qwn people and
cannot sell them.
I arn naturally in favour of carrying out
the contracts that we have made, and on that
account I am in favour of the bill. I think, in
fact I am sure, that before another year rolls
around the British government will not buy
anything more from us, except what the
Americans allow it to purchase with the
money they provide. Unless somebody else
makes loans to Britain, its only source of
money for such purchases will be the United
States.
We have to carry out our contracts and,
therefore, so far as I am concerned, this bill
could be passed today.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
from the remarks of the deputy leader (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) I think it is quite obvious
that this bill has to be passed, if for no other
reason than to enable us to carry out existing
agreements. I am among those who hope
that these agreements between governments
will soon come to an end. I gather, though,
from what the honourable gentleman said that
it is contemplated there may be further
renewals of the contracts under this Act, or
possibly new agreements covering other commodities.
When this legislation was first brought down
in parliament its purpose was to facilitate our
getting over the transitional period between
war and peace; but it now appears to be
developing into what may be a permanent
feature in relation to our sale abroad of
various agricultural products. It seems to me
undesirable that this should become a permanent feature of our commerce with Britain
or any other country. I agree with the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that we
shall ultimately get the best results by returning to a measure of private trading as between
suppliers in this country and purchasers
abroad. We are asked to extend this legislation for another year, and I hope that at the
end of that period it will be decently interred,
and that we shall hear no more of it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question? li view of the
fact that purchases for the British people are
made through their government, would it be
possible for individuals to make trading
agreements as before?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, it could not be done.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I am in order, I would
reply that before the recent election in Great
Britain the committee on estimates brought
in a recommendation to the government which
would indicate that in some respects that

country is moving away from this arrangement of bilateral contracts. That committee
recommended the re-opening of the Liverpool and London corn exchanges, and that
the former method of trading of wheat be
resumed.
Similar recommendations were
made with regard to tea and cotton. That of
course means a return to free trading between
producers and consumers.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I would appreciate the
views of honourable senators as to whether
this bill be referred to a committee or, in view
of its simplicity, be read a third time now.
The two contracts to which I have referred
have, I think, already been considered during
this session by the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources, and any information which
might be obtained by referring the bill to
committee is already in the possession of
honourable members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. Unless someone has views to the contrary, I would move
that the bill be now read a third time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gray Turgeon moved the second
reading of Bill R-2, an Act to amend the
Canadian Red Cross Society Act.
He said: Honourable senators, it is not my
intention to take up much of your time on
the motion for second reading of this bill,

I shall move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous and
Private Bills. Under the present circumstances, the committee will not be called
together until some time after the return of
honourable senators following the Easter
recess. In the meantime, possibly, I should
leave a few thoughts with honourable members, particularly as the bill was before this
house last session.
At that time sorne objection was taken to
the passage of the bill on the grounds that
the rules of the Senate had not been complied
with. The bill had passed through the other
place and came before us as the session was
nearing its end, and there was not sufficient
time to give proper consideration to the
operations of the Red Cross Society or to the
objectives of the proposed amendments.

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor

General's Speech at the opening of the session, arid the motion of Hon. Mr. Golding for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Harner: In rising to take part
in this debate I should like, on behaif of
honourable senators, to extend the sympathy
of the Senate to the people of the United
States in the tragic loss of five of their distinguished countrymen who were kilted in an

of Ottawa. Our deepest sympathy also goes
out to their families.

fully expected this from him, because he
showed signs of independence in another
place; that is why I welcomed hlm to this
chamber. I should also like to congratulate
the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt), whose remarks were of the
highest order.
My objection to the speech by the mover
is that he seems to think everything is just
fine. He claimed that, except for the odd
black spot, the members in both houses of
parliament-and especially our leaders-are
ail splendid people. When he mentioned the
odd black spot 1 was wondering whether he
was referring to me.
Sarne Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Harner: Then I thought about the
book entitled Link to tise North, in which a
story is told about a native woman gathering
up a lot of white roots in a swarhp, splitting
them, taking out the little black spots and
boiling them in a kettle, and then using the
brew to cure a man suff ering from pneumonia.

MARCH 28, 1950
I have noticed that some members start a
speech in one year and finish it the next, so
I want to do likewise and complete dealing
with a rather critical attack made on me last
year by the Toronto Star. I just want to say
to that newspaper that I, like many others,
could have been elected to parliament by
merely running for a certain party. On one
occasion I was assured that if I ran on the
Liberal ticket I would be nominated and
elected, but I declined the offer, and I ran as
a Conservative. Later I was asked to accept
the Progressive nomination, and I again
declined, saying that I would still be the
same man and that I did not believe in
camouflage. Honourable senators know that
many persons across Canada who forsook
their own parties are now holding prominent
positions in another chamber, and when they
meet an old friend they look like a small boy
who needs his mother. I at least was able to
maintain the respect of my Liberal opponent,
and when he passed away we were the best
of friends.
If the Toronto Star thinks that I would have
been a better man for being elected to office
by merely running for a certain party, it is
welcome to that notion. There are two prominent members in this chamber who first came
to Ottawa as Progressives when, as there
ought to be now, there was a great feeling
that both old parties were neglecting Western
Canada in the matter of tariffs and so on.
My honourable friend from Huron-Perth
(Hon. Mr. Golding) spoke about the splendid
example our leaders have set. Perhaps in his
remarks, he included some of those who have
passed on. I am inclined to think of the
confession heard in the Anglican Church:
We have left undone those things which we ought
to have done; and we have done those things which
we ought not to have done.

Canada has made every mistake that it is
possible for a country to make. We should
be ashamed when we think of what we have
done with our great heritage of land and
forest, and realize that we have lost to the
United States so many of our sons and
daughters, and that the money we have spent
to bring immigrants here has been wasted
because most of these people have moved on
to the States.
I have had a wide experience in meeting
people. I was raised not far from here, in
Pontiac, in as fine a settlement as there is
in Canada. There were a lot of Irish people
Faheys and
in the district-Kennedys,
O'Briens-and in all truth one could apply
to them the scriptural saying:
Better is a neighbour that Is near than a brother
far off.

There was real neighbourliness in that
district. I remember that Mrs. Kennedy
used to walk sixteen miles to market with
a basket of eggs. She raised a fine family
of eleven children, including five sons, all
of whom it was said could jump over a fivefoot fence.
When I went to Western Canada I lived
for the most part in entirely different communities, made up of Dukhobors, Ukrainians,
Poles and people of other races. I would
suggest that when we bring in such immigrants now we let them know that Canada
is a democracy, and do not ask them to
promise beforehand that they will vote for
a certain political party, as those people,
before they were nationalized, were required
to give their word that they would support
the Liberal party. That is not the way to
train immigrants to become good citizens;
thought I must admit that, politics aside,
those were first-class people.
I have before me an article entitled "Fifty
Years of Wheat Selling as I have seen it."
It is by E. J. Young. He is entirely wrong.
He tells about the Wheat Board that was
set up under the chairmanship of John I.
McFarland. He says that James Murray of
the Grain Exchange was appointed as McFarland's successor, that he sold the surplus
that had accumulated, and retired from the
board. That is an entirely wrong picture.
McFarland would not have had any great
difficulty had he been allowed to carry on.
In 1937 there was the worst crop in the
history of Western Canada, only 130 million
bushels, and the wheat that the Murray
board held was wheat on which the farmers
held participation tickets. It was their wheat.
And when it was known to every man in
the country that there would not be a crop
that year, the board was selling wheat at
70 cents a bushel and boasting about it. Yet,
all that wheat might have been sold for at
least $1.25 a bushel. I can forgive the
premier of the province of Saskatchewan for
a lot of his socialism because of the remark
he made when Murray was appointed head
of the Wheat Board. He said it was lika
putting a weasel in a chicken coop to watch
the hens.
The Saskatchewan wheat pool has beenz
sneered at and called socialistic. But honourable senators from Nova Scotia know of
the co-op down there, and the honourable
gentleman from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) has told us about the honours paid
to the man who inaugurated the credit union,
the Caisses Populaires which recently celebrated their fiftieth anniversary. It is right

SENATE

to honour such a man. Well, the sole aim
of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool was to cooperate in the sale and marketing of wheat,
and in the building of its own line of elevators to help in the achievement of that aim.
I might point out that the strongest support
of these elevators comes from districts where
there is scarcely a socialist or CCF vote. I
have always been a staunch supporter of the
co-operatives and pool elevators.
But how can there help being criticism of
organizations when the men appointed to
run them are not the best available? Yet,
anyone who criticizes the work that an
organization is doing-or, for that matter,
what the government is doing-will himself
be severely criticized and charged with disloyalty by people who seem to think that once
they are appointed they should stay on as
long as they wish, as is done in dictator
countries. We had a taste of that in this
country. As Gratton O'Leary said, we in
this country were not only having government by anniversaries, but were running a
kind of political marathon, in competition
with an Englishman named Walpole, who had
held the office of Prime Minister of Britain
for some twenty years. Incidentally, history
does not record that he did anything of
moment, other than hold on to office for a
long time.
Out in Saskatchewan a few days ago a CCF
supporter resigned from that party, saying
that he saw no difference between it and the
Liberal party, and that one was as good or
as bad as the other. Even the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) admits
that people cannot go on being half Liberal
and half something else. And, by the way,
when he utters the word "Tory" you would
almost think he was scraping his hand down
a rusty tin dish.
The railroad question-in fact the whole
question of transportation, including air
transport-is of vital importance to this
country. If anyone will take a good look
at the map and observe the route of our two
railroads across Canada, East and West, he
will conclude that our people who have to pay
freight rates and maintain the railroadsone of which is state-owned, and the other a
private enterprise-are like the fellow who is
trying to walk along with one foot on each
side of a barbed wire fence. This is a matter that demands the attention of people of
ability, and it is admitted that we have some
people of that kind in the Senate.
I have before me an article entitled No
Oscars for the Senate, which appeared on the
editorial page of yesterday's Ottawa Citizen.
As honourable senators know, "Oscars" are
prizes handed out once a year in Hollywood to

the actors who are deemed to have given the
best performance during the year. The article
begins by referring to a prize movie, Al the
King's Men, which has to do with a demagogue called Willie Stark, who becomes
governor and boss of an American state.
Finally, a doctor, employed in one of the
hospitals that Stark built, frees the people
from dictation by shooting him. The article
goes on to voice a popular idea, that in Canada
there would be no need to assassinate our
"Willie Starks", that they would be dealt with
by the Senate. Then the writer says this:
In an age when constitutional reform is in the
air in Canada, an excellent opportunity exists for
a fresh study of the Senate and the possibilities of
reforming it. If the Senate was added te the agenda
of the federal-provincial conference, and a strong
committee was set up te report on it, one point at
least could be cleared up. The Senate is often
defended as the protector of minority and sectional
interests, and the suggestion is sometimes made that
the provinces should have the power of appointing
senators. It would be worth consulting the provinces te see whether they have any interest in
preserving the Senate.
My view is that the remedy for the decline of the
Senate will net be found in anything the government does, or what the House of Commons does, but
only in the Senate itself.

That is very sensible, it seems to me.

The

article continues:
It possesses more power than the British House
of Lords, yet its reputation as being a mere rubber
stamp for legislation passed by the House of Conmons lias grown steadily.
The Senate evidently
possesses great powers to bring public policy under
scrutiny, te mobilize information, to express itself,
and to exert influence upon Canadian thought and
development. It may have started on a new road,
with its recently awakened interest in a few items
selected from the government's estimates. It remains to be seen whether the Senate has the
stamina to go through with it, or whether its
vitality is wholly exhausted by its frustrations.
Where the Senate falls down is in having missed
its destiny as an independent branch of the government of Canada. It was net intended, as Sir John
A. Macdonald once said, to be "a mere chamber for
registering the decrees of the lower house." Yet
in 1950, the Senate bas only a shred of independent
character left.
The Senate possesses more brains-

The article gets rather good now.
-more
experience, more intelligent and
demagogues than the House of Commons-

fewer

Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not free to say.

-and to despair of it would be te despair of the
human race. Yet it is content to be kept in reserve,
to wait upon the call te duty when it will perhaps
prevent the lower house from wasting public money,
when it will perhaps stand up against some Willie
Stark who bas installed himself in the East Block
and in the federal bureaucracy. The risk is that its
sword and its brains will be too rusty when the
day comes, and it will have to be someone else
who will die on the barricades defending the publie
interest.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that an editorial or an
article by some writer?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is an article by "B.T.R."
of the Citizen.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is Richardson.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I come now to the question of transportation. If the province of
Saskatchewan, from which I come, is to
remain prosperous-if it is even to remain in
the dominion-it certainly cannot stand the
recent increases in freight rates. The effect
of such increases on that province is most
severe. I notice that a member from Saskatchewan in the other house has indicated his
readiness to divide the province and give it
away. Well, that is in keeping with the
policy of the Liberal party-they have been
selling us down the river for the last few
years. But may I point out to honourable
senators that during the First Great War
Saskatchewan produced more wheat than all
the other eight provinces combined. Its agricultural area is greater by far than that of
any other province, and eventually it will be
the backbone of the nation. I believe that it
has created more new wealth from the soil
than has any other province.
In the matter of transportation, Saskatchewan is at a disadvantage geographically.
That province is a long way from the head of
the lakes, and its products cannot be shipped
west to British Columbia, as can those of
Alberta. With no competition from water
transport, our freight rates are high. For
instance, there is some market in eastern
Canada for western horses, but the increases
in freight rates make trade with that market
practically impossible.
I have no positive suggestion about what
should be done with the Canadian National
Railways, or whether it should be sold or
taken over by the Canadian Pacific Railway.
Certainly this country cannot afford two
trans-continental railways. The head of the
socialist group might advocate taking over
both railways and allowing them to run in
competition with one another. How that
would work I do not know. But today we
have two trans-continental trains running side
by side, each partially filled and both arriving
in Winnipeg at the same time. Certainly if
the railways were operated together one
would not see, as we sometimes do today, four
trains going west from Winnipeg within an
hour.
I do not quite agree with what the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross)
said as to the operation of trucks for hire.
I notice that a representative of the railways
said recently that trucks should either be
highly taxed or prohibited. The honourable

senator from Calgary suggested that the
people who are barred from using carriers
for hire would buy their own trucks. Well,
I cannot imagine a person spending $10,000
for a truck to move his furniture a thousand
miles. There bas to be a good deal of traffie
moving before a businessman will invest in
a truck.
The Speech from the Throne makes mention of the Trans-Canada Highway. A year
ago I was prepared to support the expenditure of money for such a project, but today
I am opposed to it. I believe that before we
consider a trans-Canada highway we should
build local roads to open up out-of-the-way
areas and provide some outlet for the people
living there.
After the house closed last December I
drove west across the Trans-Canada Highway.
When I mentioned going west that way people
warned me about getting stuck in the bush
and all kinds of trouble. I spoke to the
honourable senator from Prince Albert (Hon.
Mr. Stevenson), and he told me that his
daughter had come that way and found the
road all right. I expected I would have company on my trip, but finally I made it alone.
I was warned that I would require a shovel
and chains for my car, but such was not the
case.
I left Ottawa late on a Tuesday morning
and arrived in Saskatoon the following Saturday at noon, and had a lovely trip. The highway through Ontario is very good. It is well
marked in the open country by signs with
black markings on white background. In such
towns as Haileybury and New Liskeard the
road signs might be improved, but generally
they quickly catch one's eye. The trip from
Cochrane to Hearst was pleasant. The hotels
were fair and the meals wère very reasonable;
the Thunder Bay House at Geraldton was
particularly good. The section from Geraldton
down to Nipigon on Lake Superior must be
particularly pleasant in summer. I drove
from Geraldton to Kenora, a distance of something more than five hundred miles, in one
day.
West of Port Arthur there are few farms,
and the building of railways through that
area must have been very expensive. Yet there
were the two railways running side by side.
On the highway west of Port Arthur I met
twelve huge motor vans, as big as box cars,
travelling from Winnipeg; but some of the
railway cars along that stretch were empty.
There is no local freight to be carried by the
railways in that area, but on the highway
there are many of these huge vans travelling
at fifty and sixty miles an hour. They almost
blow a small car off the road.

SENATE
What will happen when passenger-carrying
buses commence to operate on the TransCanada Highway? I predict that we will see
the day when buses and transport trucks will
operate from coast to coast, and again we
will be asked to put our hands in our pockets
to meet the deficits of the Canadian National
Railways.
What is the Senate doing about protecting
the people who live a hundred miles north or
south of the Trans-Canada Highway? The
highway and the railroad parallel each other
fifty miles apart, but it is next to impossible
for local settlers to get to either one or the
other. This condition may have serious consequences when a doctor is needed, or some
other emergency occurs.
What have we done to protect our forests?
In these northern areas a fire may spread for
hundreds of miles without meeting a stop-gap.
I suggest that before we go on with the
Trans-Canada highway we should begin to
build cross-roads, and open up the country.
With the machinery now available it would
not be a difficult operation. There are many
swamps in the beautiful evergreen bush of
Northern Ontario. I am told that if these
swamps were drained, the ground would
retain plenty of moisture and the trees would
grow ten times as quickly. Further, our deer
are being slaughtered by wolves. To protect
them we need a highway every six miles,
with a game guardian to patrol the area. If
a fire should break out equipment could then
be moved very rapidly. Airplanes are all very
well, but it is difficult to land them in case of
fire and they cannot carry in much heavy
equipment. If highways were built, protection
would be easy.
Here is a national heritage which should be
guarded. I contend that the main highways
are quite good enough, but we need feeder
roads to connect with the existing roads.
People who live at a distance from the main
lines of transportation have a right to some
consideration. They are taxpayers, but they
are getting next to nothing at the present time,
except the snowdrifts and the mud which they
have to plow through. If they make any sort
of an income they are taxed in every direction,
while others receive all the benefits. For these
reasons I agree with the leader on this side
that we senators should be mindful of our
obligation to protect the small man.
What are Trans-Canada Airlines being run
for? The wealthy?, When they have a deficit
the poor man is taxed to provide the wealthy
man with accommodation. We are told that
air travel saves time. Well, if we lived in an
age when people worked six days a week, and
really did work, there might be some argument for this special service; but there does
not seem much reason for speeding up travel

when the working week is limited to five days,
leaving two days to spare. The main idea
nowadays seems to be to do as little as
possible, so I cannot see why trains or buses
are not sufficiently rapid as a means of transportation. While I was on the Pacific Coast
last winter there were several stormy days
when, because of poor visibility, planes were
unable to fly. But the highways of British
Columbia were in good order, the bus depots
were busy, and buses were arriving at Vancouver and moving off to Winnipeg, Calgary
and other distant points. They handled the
traffic, while the airplanes were grounded.
I repeat that someone in the Senate must
have the courage to deal with this question of
duplicating facilities. If we are not prepared
to challenge the policy of paralleling the services which the railways and motor buses are
capable of giving, and giving continuously I
do not know what other body can do it with
equal authority. There is, I suggest, no
greater service that we can perform.
It has been said that railroad hotels are not
paying their way. I know that some of these
hotels have operated at a profit ever since
they were built. But they were designed and
constructed for men of ordinary means, not
for the wealthy few. I understand that the
Canadian Pacific Railway hotel at Regina
cost $175,000, yet it has fifteen more rooms
than the Bessborough hotel at Saskatoon,
which cost about $4,000,000. The fact is that
anyone who stays at the Bessborough is being
accommodated at the expense of the poor
people who are taxed to meet the difference
between what he pays and the $15 a day which
he would have to pay if the hotel is to make
any interest on the money invested in it. The
Palliser at Calgary, which also belongs to the
Canadian Pacific Railway, has been consistently run at rates which ranchers and everyone else could afford. It is a good plain hotel
and has always covered its expenses. The
Macdonald at Edmonton is the result of
grandiose ideas: it has huge rooms and high
prices. I trust that when the extension is
added, it will be of a size and type to accommodate the ordinary man, not merely to serve
the rich. On this general question of what we
can and should do, I am concerned about
socialistic trends on the part of the present
government.
I have here a reprint from The Reader's
Digest of a condensation of The Road Ahead,
a book by John T. Flynn. I understand
that he is the author of a book-I have not
read it-in which the late President Roosevelt is severely criticized. Incidentally, he

British Government. It has been suggested
that the contents of this little pamphlet
should be read in every public school. He
writes:
Let us look at the black record. The Socialist
government has operated at a loss the basic industries and services which it took over. At the end
of 1948 it was producing coal at the rate of 7 million
tons a year less than- the mines under private
ownership produced before the war, notwithstanding the expenditure by the Socialist government of
over $170 million on mechanization to increase
cutput. The National Coal Board lost about $95
million in 1947. By raising the price of coal it
managed to cover costs in 1948, but it is still in the
red about $90 million since it began operations.

much for themselves as they produced before the
war for private owners. Around 84,000 miners a
day fail to show up for work.

I was talking recently to a gentleman
who was born in England and returned to
this country last year after a visit of four
months. Two of his nephews who are in
the manufacturing industry in Great Britain
told him that the percentage of absenteeism
among their employees was 17 per cent.
This figure was arrived at without including
displaced persons, who constituted one-third
of their working force, and whose attendance
record was much better.
Mr. Flynn continues:
The govermnent owns and has operated the overseas air-transport industry in the Atlantic area at a
1css of $244 on every passenger carried.

Referring to the threat to our democratic
freedom, the author states:
One of the first things those opposed to this
socialistic program must do is to rid themselves
of the moral intimidation which bas been imposed
on their minds. In the debate around this problem, the American system has been painted as
something, wicked, bungling, even brutal, while the
Planned New World of the future will be filled with
sweetness, light and plenty. The very word "profit"
has been endowed with sinister implications.
But it ls not a choice between a perfect system
called Socialism and an imperfect system called
Capitalism. It is a choice between two human systems both of which will inevitably have their
imperfections because they are human ...
In Italy Socialists of various schools dominated
the political life with the same results as in
Germany, and that too ended in Fascism and
Mussolini.

Honourable senators, this illustrates what
these things will lead to. The honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) spoke about Russia not practising communism. Well, Canada is not practising
democracy, and some of these days we shall
have to show the world that we are willing
to practise it. Last year I complained about
the huge amount we were spending for
defence purposes, but defence expenditures
have been increased this year. Comparitively recent history shows that a nation's
downfall is caused by forces from within.

For instance, was it an outside enemy that
overthrew the Russian government, or that
took over control in Germany? What about
the forces that took over in Italy, and what
about the American revolution?
Hon. Mr. Farris: What about Czechoslovakia?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I admit that Czechoslovakia has been overrun by an outside
power, but perhaps if we were doing our full
duty some things that have been happening
in the world might not have taken place. For
instance, there was a time in Britain's history when, with ships and guns, she undertook to see that justice was done to peoples
who were wrongfully treated. But the great
fear that is sweeping this country has resulted
in our spending approximately $600 million
for defence. If we do not set our own house
in order and satisfy our people and the rest
of the world that we are practising democracy, we shall certainly need what this money
is being used for. We were told recently
that it did not matter why the Minister of
Justice refused to publish a certain report.
But this action may yet make it necessary
for us to spend many more millions on
defence. We cannot afford to have our people
lose faith in our democratic form of government. It is like a man trying to cut hay
without a knife in his mower-the hay all
piles up behind him. In other words, what
is the use of spending money on national
defence if there is discontentment at home?
We hear a lot of talk about Exercise Sweetbriar, and so on, but these things are of no
avail if our people cannot be assured of justice. Our danger comes, not from without
but from within. Look at what happened in
Italy, and the rape of Ethiopia by Mussolini.
Dr. Riddell, our representative at the old
League of Nations, attempted to have Mussolini's expansion movements restricted, but
our government failed to back him up. How
many millions of lives might have been saved
if some restraining action had been taken?
Mussolini's representatives here in Canada
appealed to our government, and the leader
of our government-who, incidentally, was
praised so much by the mover of the Address
-stated, "Canada will not take that action
at all". Honourable senators know what
eventually happened.
As the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has on occasion quoted
Oliver Goldsmith, perhaps I will be permitted to read a poem by the same author
entitled The Deserted Village.
Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey
The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,
'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand
Between a splendid and a happy land.
Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,

SENATE
And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;
Hoards e'en beyond the niiser's wish abound,
And rich men flock from all the world around.
Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name
That leaves our useful products still the same.
Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride
Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,
Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;
The robe that laps bis limbs in silken sloth
Has robb'd neighbouring fields of half their
growth;
His seat, where solitary sports are seen,
Indignant spurns the cottage from the green;
Around the world each needful product flies,
For all the luxuries the world supplies:
While thus the land adorn'd for pleasure, all
In barren splendour feebly waits the fall.

That was Italy: a place where rich men
lived in barren splendour, and where the
poor were neglected. Thus a small force
within was all that was necessary to overthrow the country.
The Speech from the Throne forecast the
presentation of a bill to widen the scope and
extend the benefits of unemployment insurance. Well, this will merely result in a
further tax on our people, and they will never
receive any benefits from it. We already pay
taxes indirectly in a hundred different ways,
and the load now is really heavy. For
instance, we used to be able to ship wheat
down to the Great Lakes for 22 cents a
bushel, and in some cases it would go all the
way from Fort William to Liverpool, England,
for 5 cents a bushel. Now we have to pay
10 cents a bushel. The shipping people are
making millions of dollars, but we are told
that they have to pay excess profit taxes and
so on. When the honourable leader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Haig) had concluded his speech
on the second reading of Bill 14 the other
day, the honourable senator from Mount
Stewart (Hon. Mr. MeIntyre) gave figures
to show that both single and married
men in the United States and Great Britain
were taxed more heavily than Canadians. But
let me say to him that a person living in the
States can buy an automobile for $400 less
than a person living in Canada, and can buy
a washing machine at half the price paid in
Canada. The cost of living is much less in that
country.
Hon. Mr. Duff: You are a free trader?
Hon. Mr. Horner: You bet I am a free
trader.
Here I should like to make a brief quotation from a recently discovered speech that
was made by Abraham Lincoln in 1858, when
he was a candidate for election to the United
States Senate. This campaign speech, which
was delivered without preparation, provides
further proof of what an amazing man Lincoln
was. Referring to the men who drafted the
Declaration of Independence, he said:

Wise statesmen as they were, they knew the tendency of posterity to breed tyrants; and so they
established these great self-evident truths, that
when in the distant future some man, some faction,
some interest, should set up the doctrine that none
but rich men, or none but white men, or none but
Anglo-Saxons, were entitled to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, their posterity might look up
again to the Declaration of Independence, and take
courage to renew the battle which their fathers
began-so that truth, and justice, and mercy, and
all the humane and Christian virtues might not be
extinguished from the land; so that no man hereafter would dare to limit and circumscribe the
great principles on which the temple of liberty was
being built.
Now, my countrymen, if you have been taught
doctrines which conflict with the great landmarks
cf the Declaration of Independence, if you have
listened to suggestions which would take from its
grandeur, and mutilate the symmetry of its proportions; if you have been inclined to believe that all
men are not created equal in those inalienable
rights enumerated by our charter of liberty; let
me entreat ycu to come back. Return to the fountain whose waters spring close by the blood of the
revolution. Think nothing of me-take no thought
for the political fate of any man whomsoever-but
come back to the truths that are in the Declaration
of Independence. You may do anything with me
ycu choose, if you will but heed these principles.
You may not only defeat me for the Senate, but
you may take and put me to death. While pretending no ind.iference to earthly honours, I do claim to
be actuated in this contest by something higher
than an anxiety to office. I charge you to drop
every paltry and insignificant thought for any man's
It is nothing; I am nothing; Judge
success.
Dcuglas is nothing. But do not destroy that immortal enblem of humanity-the Declaration of
Independence.

We have a wonderful climate in the prairie
provinces. The honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) has often
urged the need for irrigation in southern and
central Alberta, and no wonder, for the soil
out there is very rich and needs only water
to make it the most productive in the whole
world. It was in that district that the famous
song Home On The Range originated. And
the words of the song are true, for in that
part of the country "The skies are not cloudy
all day".
We hear a good deal in these times about
unemployment, and I sympathize with the
government. I really do. There is lots of
work to be done, but the difficulty is that
while many people are looking for positions
with good salaries, very few want work. There
is work for millions, if we would only undertake it. I recommend a project that would
repay every dollar spent upon it-the building
of a railroad from Flin Flon through the north
country, right to Stewart, British Columbia.
That line would open up vast mineral and
timber resources, and some farming land.
But the argument advanced against proceeding with this and many another first-class
project is lack of money. However, as was
said by the editor of a paper in Lloydminster,

MARCH 28, 1950
"Nothing is so unsound as so-called sound
money." We cannot even run a pipeline
through our own country, although we know
that it would pay well. What would you
think of a farmer who had something that
would obviously bring him in a good profit
and who turned it over to his neighbour? Any
aduit flot confined to a mental hospital knows
that we could make lots of money out of oil
pipelines through our own country;ý yet we
seem to. think they are too big a job for us to
finance, and so we bring in outsîde capital.
I say again that I would like the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) to tell me how we can hope to seli our
products abroad unless we have free trade.
And I ask him also: How human and how
Christian have we been in our treatment of
the Japanese on the Pacific coast? Can we
expect the Japanese to believe that we are a
real democracy? Many Japanese people who
were born on the coast worked hard and long
as fishermen and market gardeners. They
knew no other wày of living than the Canadian way, and thfy endeavoured to make a
success under ouresystem. This winter I was
within a mile of the honourable senator's
home, and I was shown a place on which an
immense amount of hard work must have
been done. There was a nice house, worth
about $10,000, and it was taken from a Japanese at a price of $1,700.
Hon. Mr. Reid: A good price at the time.
I would take my oath on that.
Hon. Mr. Horner: These men were born
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable gentleman
does not know what he is talking about.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Let us have Japanese
shirts and shoes in Saskatchewan, let us have
genuine free trade, and then we shaîl be able
to seil our own goods. How can we teach the
Japanese democracy if we impose dumping
duties against their goods and put fictitious
values on them for customs purposes?
The other day the senator from Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon) suggested that the United
Nations should exclude Chinese representatives from certain conferences. I wonder if
he has any idea how that could be done.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I think I have. 0f
course, at the time I was referring ony to
conferences on atomic and hydrogen bombs.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We denied the vote to
large numbers of people and we would not
allow them to bring their wives to this country. What right have we to send missionaries
abroad. Let us search our own hearts.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I stopped subscribing
to foreign missions some years ago.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I know many people
Who have done that.
Now, honourable senators, 1 should like to
quote from another newspaper article týhat I
have here. It is headed 11Weak Weapons."
Mr. David Lilienthal, who resigned as chairman
of the United States Atomic Energy Commission to
devote himself to public education, does not hesitate to quarrel with scientists who expect atoici
energy ta destroy the world. In a notable speech
he attacked four famous scientlsts who recently predîcted the end of everything in an atomic war.
"For thirty minutes," Mr. Lilienthal said. "four
scjentists speculated on how to wipe out the earth.
These fine minds came Up with this fine contribution to transplant thirty to sixty million people.
Wjth ail due respect to them I want ta state that
this is a lot of high inteilectual. nonsense. It can't
be done. It won't be done."
There is no safety in retreat from the problem
of atomie and hydrogen bombs, Mr. Lilienthal
believes, no hope in the dispersai of industry and
people in burrows under the earth. Nor is a stockpile of these weapons any guarantee of securlty.

I will skip part of the article and read the
Iast paragraph, which interested me very
much:
Mr. Lilienthal has put his finger on the real crisis
cf aur time-the crisis of democratlc faith. He has
identified the true diiemma when he says that
democratic peopies wiil be lost if they substitute
a faith in weapons for a faith in ideas.

I am very much in sympathy with these
remarks of Mr. Lilienthal. If we are going
to allow ojîs to comne into Canada, and permit
oleomargarine to be sold in competition with
butter, with 400,000 local industries being
depressed, then by all means let us demand
that our goods be allowed access to the markets of the world, and that we be not prohibited from buying from the cheapest source.
We are at the crossroads as far as our
young men are concerned. What will happen
if they continue to depend on social security
from the cradle to the grave? I heartily
agree with the feelings of Mr. Mutch on this
subi ect, as expressed in the March number of
the News Letter.
There comes to my mind a biblical story,
which may have some application today. The
children of Israel sent out their spies to view
a land said to be fiowing with milk and honey.
The spies reported back that they had found
such a land, but that it was inhabited by
giants and was very dangerous. Now, the
children of Israel were not prepared to make
the necessary sacrifices to occupy the
promised land. Perhaps a present-day interpretation would be that they preferred an
eight-hour day and a five-day week. It takes
effort and hard work to successfully maintain
a land the products of which are milk and
honey. There is no suggestion that it was a
land flowing with oleomargarine and oils.

SENATE
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And nothing is said about
manufacturers who want to produce one day
and then shut down for the balance of the
week. The moral of this ancient story seems
to be that people should be willing to make
sacrifices-to get up in the morning and do
a useful task.
There are farms within a radius of sixty
miles of Ottawa on which were raised
stalwart families of eight or ten children
without one cent of assistance from the government. Today those farms are vacant, and
the young men have not sufficient courage to
leave the congested cities to work them. Now
we are extending the unemployment insurance and increasing the baby bonus. I foresee
the day when, by reason of these social
measures, we will be going around in a circle
and nobody will be creating any new wealth.
The Bible tells us in several places that we
must earn our bread by the sweat of our
brow. With the few hours that people work
today, nobody is doing much sweating.
Medical doctors tell us that man is an animal,
and in order to have good health he must
have plenty of exercise. I maintain that an
eight-hour working day, five days a week, is
not enough exercise for any strong young
man.
There are in the other place members of
the government who unfortunately-or fortunately for them-amassed for themselves
a sizable fortune before the present system
of taxation came in vogue, and who now say
to the other fellow: "You go out and make
the money I did." Well, with the high taxation it simply cannot be done. The attitude of
men such as these bring to my mind this
biblical passage:
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be
borne, and lav them on men's shoulders; but they
themselves will not move them with one of their
fingers.

The young man of today is so heavily taxed
that in many instances he is not even able to

build a house for his family. His cost of living
is out of all proportion to his earnings.
I have before me an article entitled
"Franco: Brilliant Fourflusher", which interested me very much and which I should like
to read. It is as follows:

Now that the United States actively, and the rest
of us at least passively, are helping Franco maintain his grip on Spain, it might be well for all of
us to read "Report on Spain." Its author, Emmet
John Hughes, speaks with exceptional weight on
this subject because he is a Roman Catholic who
spent several years, during and after world war Il,
in Madrid, first with the OWI then as press attache
of the U.S. Embassy.
In this fascinating book Mr. Hughes explains how
Franco, as brilliantly successful a fourflusher as
history has known, has remained in power only by

playing off the Army, the Church and the Falange
against each other. The regime he describes as
"a government without the people, above the people
and against the people." He details Franco's eager
aid to our enemies during the war. He describes
the total police state in all its repressive aspects
including complete censorship and unspeakable torture of political prisoners. And he explains just
why Spain matters to the ordinary citizen of the
Americas.
Mr. Hughes shows clearly that the only hope
ccmmunism has of ever winning Spain is through
the perpetuation of the Franco regime. He believes
that the Soviet rulers know this and that the
reason for continued communist calls to press
Franco out of power is to make sure that we shall
continue to do exactly the opposite. He thinks
that in doing so we are playing into the communists'
hands and that they are making frightened puppets
of us. The recent reported Soviet-Spanish grain
and oil deals fit in perfectly with this thesis, which
has already been borne out in a parallel way in
China.
Mr. Hughes outlines several courses of possible
action, one of which he believes could force Franco
out within a few months without alienating the
Spanish people by attempting to dictate to them as
regards a new government. He makes it clear that
this would not force democracy in but that it would
open the road to the Spanish democrats and fore.tall the communist triumph which otherwise he
sees as eventually inevitable. It might be worth
cur while to consider his point of view and, if we
find it logical to do something about our foreign
policy so as not to continue handing countries to
the cçmmunists on a silver platter.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: That is all nonsense.

If

Spain did not have Franco she would have
Stalin, and he would be in control of the
whole Mediterranean.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Who will lick Russia
first in Europe?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, who will?
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Franco.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: He is the only one who
has successfully met Stalin so far.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I do' not think so, but I
am only expressing my own opinion, as I am
entitled to do. I quite agree with that article.
I do not believe there was ever an all-out
war in Spain. I know a man from Winnipeg
who took part in the Spanish war, so-called,
and if conditions at that time were as he
described them, I have every sympathy for
the people of that country. However, the Mr.
Hughes mentioned in this article has been
in Spain for some time and ought to know
what he is talking about.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The Spaniards are worse
than the Russians, are they not?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I do not know. If they
are being persecuted as this article suggests,
the situation is critical. Of course our trouble
is that we are not permitted to know what
conditions are in Russia today.

MARCH 28. 1950
Now, honourable senators, I think I have
covered what I intended to say. But let me
emphasize that not one more dollar should
be spent on the Trans-Canada highway. I
suggest to the leader of the opposition that
the province in which he lives could improve the system of marking Manitoba roads.
The yellow and black signs are not easily
seen; at the cost of a few hundred dollars
they could be made more legible, and figures
could be added to indicate distances. The
tourist road through Northern Ontario is
first-rate, and I commend the provincial
engineers for a wonderful job. They refrained
from doing a foolish thing which has been
done in the Western Provinces, that is,
levelling the hills-as though they were
making a railroad-and digging deep ditches.
Wherever possible they followed the contours of the land. It Is a beautiful road,
and a delight to anyone who travels over it.
Plenty of accommodation is to be had; camps
are located at convenient intervals; I believe
there is lots of fishing to be had nearby; and
it is a pleasant route for a summer vacation.
To conclude, we must bear in mind the
need for crossroads; we have never had
them. I recall years ago, that Sir Alexander
Gibb, after he had paid a visit to Fort
Churchill, made a speech at Montreal in
which he said he was amazed at what we
had accomplished in a new country, but

the thing that amazed him most was that we
had built a highway across the country
alongside a railroad track.
Let us operi up our national forests. A
railway from Flin Flon west would cross the
pre-Cambrian shield, where there are
reported to be important deposits of iron with
a lighter overburden than in any other part
of Canada.
I hope I have said something which will
stir up interest in these matters. I have
made the effort because I feel that this
chamber is not doing all that it might do.
The Senate includes in its membership some
of the best brains of the country. They are
used in other directions, but I doubt whether
they are exercised here to the extent that
they might be. I feel that some of the
criticism levelled against this chamber is
justified, and that we should rise to the level
of our opportunities, for if ever there was
a time when this country and the world at
large faced what can truly be called a crisis,
that time is now.
My remarks have been somewhat disjointed, but you have borne with me, and
I thank you.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Stambaugh the
debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

AGRICULTURAL PRICES SUPPORT BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 17, an Act ta amend the
Agricultural Prices Support Act, 1944.
The bill was read the first time.

designated by the Governor in Council, and includes
processed meat, dairy and poultry products if so
designated.

I come now to the powers of the board. The
chief power with which I think this body will
be concerned is that of periodically prescribing prices which would really constitute floor
prices for these agricultural products. Under

SENATE
section 9 the board, in accordance with regulations that may be made by the Governor in
Council, has authority:
to prescribe from time to time, with the approval
of the Governor in Council, prices at which the
Board may purchase agricultural products in the
market.

Another paragraph deals with the right of
the board to pay to the producers of an agricultural product a sum which would represent
the difference between the average market
price as determined and a price which may
be established by the board as being reasonable at that time. That provision, I take it,
would be used mainly in connection with
contracts for the sale of agricultural products
for export. It is really a bonus or subsidy.
The overriding policy with relation to dealing with prices is contained in subsection 2
of section 9, which provides that in prescribing pricesthe Board shall endeavour to ensure adequate and
stable returns for agriculture . . . and shall
endeavour to secure a fair relationship between
the returns from agriculture and those from other
occupations.

There you have the substance of this legis-

lation, which at the present time is part of
the law of the land, but will cease to be so in
another day unless we extend its life for a
limited time or make it permanent. The bill
comes to us from the other place in a form
which would make it part of the permanent
law of Canada.
In that connection I wish to point out that
the Board, in operating under the Act as it is,
has functioned in relation to some agricultural
products, namely potatoes, apples, dried white
beans, dried skimmed milk, honey, butter and
cheddar cheese. Operations concerning these
products extended from 1946 to 1949 and are
still continuing. The net cost to the government in respect of purchases and sales of
potatoes, apples, dried white beans, and dried
skimmed milk amounted to $7,492,200.09. This
is the loss which the Board incurred in the
purchase and sale of these commodities.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Has the honourable senator
a breakdown of those figures?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: I should like to have them.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I intended, with the permission of the Senate, to put the details on
the record, as part of the explanation which
I am giving. Does the honourable senator
require the particulars only by commodities
in terms of dollars?
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I could even give the
information by locations.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Just the quantity, in dollars.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: With regard to potatoes,
in 1946 the net loss was $170,748.48. In 1947
the net loss on apples (Nova Scotia) was
The net loss on potatoes in
$3,119,274.22.
1948 was $1,646,839.34. The net loss on apples
in the same year was
(Nova Scotia)
$1,443,231.39. The net loss on apples (British
Columbia) in 1948 was $44,650.93. In the
same year the net loss on dried white beans,
which by the way were from Ontario, was
In 1949 the net loss on dry
$194,419.88.
skimmed milk was $5,043.52, and in the same
year the net loss on apples (both Nova Scotia
and British Columbia) was $867,992.33. There
are three other items for 1949 for which we
have no figures yet, because the board is still
in possession of substantial quantities of these
products. I refer to honey, butter and Cheddar cheese. As of December 31, 1949, the
quantities of these products on hand were as
follows: honey, 2,985,322 pounds; butter,
40,694,784 pounds; Cheddar cheese, 18,680,469
poùnds. With regard to these three products,
from January 1, 1950 to the present time, the
board holds a small balance in excess of the
cost so far as the quantities sold are concerned.
This gives some indication of the manner in
which the board functions.
I should point out that according to my
interpretation the Act is not one which guarantees that the price prevailing at a certain
time is to be the price which the Board will
establish-with the approval of the Governor
in Council-as being the floor price or the
price at which the board will buy. What the
statute does provide is that the board, in fixing
prices at which it will buy or subsidize, mus't
have regard to certain factors which establish
some reasonable relationship between the
production costs of these agricultural products
and general costs in other fields of endeavour.
That is the basic principle, and there is no
guarantee that the price of a certain agricultural commodity today, for instance, is to be
the measuring stick for all time.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Do they control the sale
of the products as well?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: When the board purchases products, it will control their sale. The
products become the property of the board
and, indirectly, of the government.
May I just say in passing that when the bill
relating to this subject came before the Senate
in 1944 there was some debate, and from the
speeches then made it seemed that the support
of it was unanimous. I can still recall what
was said, and I refreshed my memory by
reading what some senators had to say about
the bill at that time. I was very pleased to note
that, since it now seems to be part of the government policy, the honourable senator from

MARCH 29, 1950
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and the bonourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) both supported the bill. The only
criticism they had to make of it was that the
government did not go far enough, and make
the measure part of the permanent legislation
of Canada. I must confess that when I read
what these two senators had to say in 1944, it
made me feel that they have a gift that some
of the rest of us do not possess.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Read what was said at that
time.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They claimed that this
measure was not necessary at that time, but
they forecast that in four or five years it
would be most necessary to the agricultural
life of Canada, and they argued that it should
therefore be made part of the permanent legislation of this country.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We did not have margarine then, though.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not want to get off
on a side issue-though I do think that even
margarine might qualify for assistance under
this Act.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: But in this regard I think
margarine can get along much better than
butter.
Now that we are discussing agriculture, I
thought that I should point out the pronouncements of these honourable senators and that
they should be listened to with some degree
of attention. I do not know what glass they
were looking into or what people they were
talking to, but certainly their prophecy as to
what would be likely to happen was true. It
has become necessary, perhaps a little earlier
than they forecast it would, but certainly just
as they predicted, that this legislation be made
part of the permanent legislation of Canada.
This does not mean that I am inclined to
agree with this view. But, much as I dislike
the government being in business, we must
remember that during the war years we interfered very materially with the law of supply
and demand in relation to agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And if we are going to
interfere with the law of supply and demand
when it swings very markedly in favour of
the producer, I think that having embarked
on that course of action we must take the
consequences that flow from it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is exactly my idea.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If we interfere with
large bodies of producers at a time when
interference may be of distinct advantage to

a substantial part of our consumer population, then it is only decent and equitable that
at a later date we provide some method of
ensuring that the basic cost is returned to the
producers. I do not think there is much more
to say in favour of this bill.
There are one or two parts of the original
Act that should be amended if this legislation
is to become part of our permanent law. We
should be consistent, and delete from the
preamble of the Act the words which
described it as being effective "during the
transition period from war to peace". I think
also that we should remove from section 9 (2)
the words qualifying the powers of the Board
in prescribing prices, namely:
The Board shall endeavour to ensure adequate
and stable returns for agriculture . . .

and

That phrasing has no place in permanent
legislation, and if the Senate approves of this
bill in principle, and it is not desired that it
should go to committee, I would suggest that
we resolve ourselves into a Committee of the
Whole in order to perform this decent mutilation and give the legislation the appearance
of permanency.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
you will have gathered from the remarks of
the honourable senator from Toronto that
we on this side of the chamber will not be
raising any strenuous objection to the passing
of this measure. I always feel that when the
senator from Toronto has finished introducing
a bill, no matter what its nature may be,
there is very little left to be said by anyone
else.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: He has covered several
points that I intended to bring out in my argument. Legislation of this kind bas long been
advocated by the Conservative party, and is,
in fact, a plank in the party's platform. Therefore, we are not going to raise any serious
objections to the principle of the bill.
My effort will be directed to giving all the
assistance in my power towards passage of
the measure. If I have any objection at all
it will be because no real formula for fixing
floor prices is set out in the bill, or in the act
which we are extending. By that I mean
that there is no definite plan, The minister
makes the decision in every case, and it is
always difficult to 'understand just how the
decision is arrived at. For example, in fixing
the price for eggs, the figures were juggled
and a decision given, and I do not know that

SENATE

.. e are yet fully informed as to how the
price of 38 cents was determined.
As stated. by the honourable senator from
Toronto. the object of the Act of 1944 was
to support prices during the transitional
period following the war, and the intention
was to extend the measure from year to year.
Now we are going to make it a permanent
part of our legislation.
In reading the debate on the bill in another
place, I noticed that there was a general discussion of prices of not only wheat, oats and
barely but of all other products whose prices
were fixed during the war and, in most
cases, are still fixed. The honourable gentleman mentioned these indirectly, and I propose to give some specific examples to show
what has taken place.
The price of any agricultural product,
honourable senators, is bound up with and
tied to the price of wheat. At the present
time many of our markets for agricultural
products have been lost, and surpluses are
piling up. That is why it is necessary to
extend this legislation. The ceilings that
were placed on the prices of all agricultural
products diuring the war kept the prices
down, and on that account Canadian agricultural producers lost many hundreds of
millions of dollars. When prices were first
fixed, shortly after the establishment of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, wheat, oats,
barley and other farm products were at their
lowest levels for many years, for they had
not then fully recovered from the low to
which they fell during the 30's.
From time to time the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and I have
made speeches here referring to the low
prices of wheat, cattle, hogs and cereal grains,
and I should like now to give a summary of
the prices that prevailed during the war
and shortly before it broke out.
In 1938-39 the price of No. 1 Northern
wheat, f.o.b. Fort William and Port Arthur
was 62 cents; oats were 29 cents, and No. 1
feed barley was 36 cents. Honourable senators will admit that these prices are very
low indeed, and would not cover the cost
of production. In 1939-40 prices were up a
little. Wheat was 76.5 cents, oats 35.6 cents
and barley 42-5 cents. Those prices were
maintained for the crops of 1940-41 and
1941-42, and for the greater part of the
1942-43 crop. It was not until the 1943-44
crop was grown and marketed that the price
of wheat went above $1 a bushel. For that
crop the prices were: wheat $1.23; oats
51-5 cents and barley 64.8 cent;
Those
prices continued in effect for the crops of

1944-45 and 1945-46. Participation payments
have increased the amount received by grain
growers for the three crop years since then.
I mentioned that a number of speeches
referring to the low prices of agricultural
products had been made by senators on this
side of the chamber. One such speech was
delivered by the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) on February 3, 1949. I had
previously spoken on the same subject on
March 21, 1947, and I d'iscussed the matter
again on March 16, 1949. In order to show
that three years ago we on this side took
the same stand that we do now, I should
like to quote briefly from what I said here
on March 21, 1947:
My chief objection, honourable senators, to this
whole matter has been the manipulation of prices.
In my opinion it can neither be justified nor
explained.
People in this part of the country
can scarcely understand exactly what has been
going on. It is difficult enough for us, who are
dealing in wheat almost daily, to understand the
set-up.
The Canadian Wheat Board still seils wheat to
the millers of Canada for 77à cents a bushel. For
a long time the board paid the farmer for that
wheat at $1.25 a bushel. For any wheat used domestically the farmer drew $1.25 a bushel and the
government made up the difference by way of
a subsidy. That accounts for two prices. During
a good deal of this time the board was exporting
wheat at $1.55. That represents a third price. Wheat
is still being sold to the millers at 771 cents but the
price to the farmer for such wheat is $1.35 a bushel
and the difference is being made up by way of
a dominion subsidy. There is still another price
that bas been prevailing for some time-the world
price. Just how the poor farmer can understand
all those prices, I do not know.
We heard in this bouse recently that the world
price bas been running close to the $3 mark.

Now I wish to refer briefly to the speech
which I made in this chamber on March 16,
1949, reported at page 173 of Hansard. I do
not intend to read what I said at that time.
I pointed out that on the 1946 wheat crop the
farmers of Western Canada lost 891 cents a
bushel on 169 million bushels; that in 1947
they lost $1.331 per bushel on 170 million
bushels; and that on the sale of wheat, for
consumption in Canada, there was a loss of
$73 million. The total loss for the two years
was over $500 million. Those figures, to my
knowledge, have not been successfully disputed. I htave been told, and I find that it has
been said in another place, that the grand
total of the losses on cereal grains and other
farm products, not only for the years 1946
and 1947, but for the full period up to the
present time, is in the neighbourhood of $2
billimn. This bill would set up a revolving
fund of $200 million, which is only ten per
cent of the total loss the farmers have suffered.
I am giving these figures because I believe
that the wheat price governs the prices of
hogs, cattle, poultry and dairy products. If

MARCH 29, 1960

the price of wheat is high or reasonable, one
usually finds that the prices of these other
items are high, or at least reasonable.
Honourable senators will readily see that
during the recent war and since, the agricultural producers of this country contributed a
great deal of money to consumers in Canada
and other countries to which their products
have been shipped. In my opinion they have
built up a huge credit of $2 billion. If things
go from bad to worse, the passage of this bill
will give them a chance to recover some of
that money.
The government has continually made
promises about what the farmers might expect
in return for their products. I wish now to
put on the record a few statements which
have been made by some of the members of
the government.
In a speech made at London, Ontario, on
October 15, 1944, the Minister of Agriculture
is reported in the Windsor Daily Star of the
following day as follows:
In placing ceilings upon products, with limited
subsidies now, the government is assuming responsibility to maintain floors until this country is
re-established after the war. The government owes
this to the farmers who have maintained production
under ceilings, and also owes it to the men and
women who will return from the services to the
farms.

On December 2, 1943, the Prime Minister,
speaking over the radio, said:
As an essential part of its post-war policy the
government intends to ask parliament, at the next
session, ta place a floor under the prices of the
main farm products.

In the Speech from the Throne delivered
early in 1944, I find these words:
To ensure economic stability for agriculture, you
will be asked ta make provision for a price floor for
staple farm products.

Following that forecast the Minister of
Agriculture, in July, 1944, introduced a bill
asking for agricultural prices support, and
quoted the views of a recent Liberal convention as follows:
We advocate a policy under which Canada will
provide security for farmers and fishermen by safeguarding against inflation now and by guaranteeing
minimum prices for their products against collapse
of prices after the war.

Those are some of the promises made by
the government of that day, but many other
promises have been made since. For example,
just before the last federal election the
Minister of Agriculture is reported to have
said at certain places in Saskatchewan that
the "have regard" feature of the British wheat
agreement would be considered shortly, and
that in the fall of 1949 the farmers would
receive consideration for the losses they had
sustained under that agreement, by reason of
the "have regard" clause having had no
effect.

I would point out that if this country is to
remain prosperous the farmers must obtain
fair prices for their products. The people
engaged in agriculture comprise 271 to 33 per
cent of the total population. In 1926 the
farmers' share of the national income was 17
per cent; in 1947 it went down to 11-3 per
The Minister of Agriculture went
cent.
further and said that 60 per cent of the consumers are directly engaged in agriculture or
in some way are indirectly connected with it.
I reiterate that the agricultural producers
have built up a huge credit by subsidizing the
consumers during the war years and after;
that the prosperity of agriculture is vital;
that when prices for agricultural products are
high we have general prosperity, and when
prices are low we have bankruptcy and
depression.
Honourable senators well recall that in the
30's, when eggs were five cents a dozen and
wheat reached the lowest price in history, not
only was the farmer in a bankrupt condition
but every businessman in Canada was in a
similar plight.
I was much disturbed by the recent
announcement that the United States has a
huge surplus of agricultural products on hand,
and that under the Marshall Aid Plan the
American Government intended to give away
$1 billion worth of American goods, principally agricultural products, instead of furnishing the money to the countries who would
buy these products. This disturbing situation
will, I think, interfere greatly with the sale
The
of Canadian agricultural products.
United States has a surplus of the same products as we have. At the present time we
have butter, eggs, meat and poultry piled up
in storage. Our only hope, honourable senators, is in the passage of such legislation as
we now have before us. I know that the
farmers of the country-certainly this is true
of those in the part that I come from-are in
favour of this bill, and I hope that honourable
senators will pass it today.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
is possible that some of my colleagues in this
house have some idea of my reaction to this
bill. It has been brought in and explained on
behalf of the government in a very lucid
speech by the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). His presentation
was marked with the clarity which invariably
characterizes his speeches, and the bill has
received a bountiful blessing from my honourable friends opposite. In these circumstances
it is merely a gesture of futility to attempt
any opposition to it. But there are a few
comments which may usefully be made.
To what the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) had to say

SENATE
about the disabilities from which farmers
have suffered in the marketing of their
products I can largely subscribe. But I think
his estimate of two billion dollars as being
the loss they have sustained under the policies
of the last several years is quite fantastic.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We will not argue about
the amount.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Nevertheless, agriculturists have had substantial losses under the
British wheat agreement and under the
restrictions, imposed and maintained for
several years after the war, against the export
of Canadian agricultural products to the
United States. On that ground it might be
argued with some reason that the bill before
us, which contemplates floor prices, is a
measure to compensate farmers for what they
have lost in the last few years.
But, having said that, it does appear to me
that there are certain dangers in legislation
of this kind. Following the war the world
was in a seller's market. Food products of
all kinds, in Canada and elsewhere, commanded high prices. The same could be said
of practically every type of product. Now
we are passing from that stage to a condition
wherein we have surpluses, and these surpluses may accumulate rapidly. The honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Asteltine) spoke of the surpluses in the United
States, and mentioned that they were so large
that within the last year large quantities of
food products, especially potatoes, have been
destroyed. This state of things will probably
continue. So we are faced with this legislation, which embodies the principle of maintenance of what may be described as floor
prices.
Who is to determine what are adequate
floor prices? Here, in my judgment, lies the
chief objection to this legislation. The honourable senator from Toronto quoted from the
legislation a stipulation that floor prices shall
be adequate and stable and shall bear some
proper relation to what commodities in other
lines of commerce may be selling at.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Parity prices.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I ask, who is to determine,
and how, what are adequate and stable
prices? The only machinery for this purpose
that is provided in the legislation is that the
Minister of Agriculture, who has the administration of this Act, will present a recommendation to his colleagues in council and,
after discussion, they shall arrive at the
so-called floor price. The prediction may
safely be made now that that price will not
have been published forty-eight hours until
someone in some part of the country will

object to it on the ground that it is insufficient; and probably the first, or among the
first, to object will be my honourable friends
opposite.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Certainly there has been
enough contention over efforts to control and
regulate prices during the last few years. It
is not so long ago that the price of eggs, upon
the termination of the contract with the
United Kingdom, took a dive downwards, and
an effort was made-probably all that could
be done-to stabilize the marketing of this
product. Was that effort acceptable? Was it
satisfactory? Criticism came from farmers'
organizations and from political bodies that
the government, in the price it fixed, had been
extremely parsimonious.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The honourable leader of
the opposition confirms my statement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is it conceivable that
any price that will be fixed by the Governor
in Council will be accepted as satisfactory?
If criticism ended there, probably the consequences would not be so dangerous. But
the matter will be a source of political discussion week in and week out, month in
and month out, until the next election comes
along, and then we shall hear opponents of
the government saying "If only we had been
in power you would have received much more
generous treatment than you got from this
parsimonious government." The leader of
the opposition laughs. I am willing to give
him the benefit of the doubt, and to agree for
purposes of debate, that the party of which
he is the leader in this house is so filled with
virtue that it would not use that sort of an
argument.

-

Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, perish the thought.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But there are others who
will use it. So discussions at elections will
proceed on the basis of who will offer the
greatest favours to the agricultural community
of this country. In other words, farmers put
themselves on the auction block and I do not
think that that is a desirable state of affairs
under any circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It works with other
interests in the country so you cannot blame
the farmers for trying it out.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They will try anything.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, the system works
with others.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend

preferred to feed them rather than take

In those days not more than four or five
binders were sold on Prince Edward Island.
But last year I believe our people bought
a thousand new motor cars. In a single small
section, that of O'Leary, one oil company
served seventy-three farm tractors. The farmers have motor cars, tractors and farm
machinery, most of which things are manufactured in Ontario and Quebec.
Union
labour is employed in making them, and the
farmers have to pay high prices or go without.
Last year we had a crop of about 15 million
bushels of potatoes. Perhaps 13 million
bushels were available for sale. They are
being sold and have been sold ever since last
fall for as low as 36 cents a bushel-that is,
36 cents for 60 pounds of potatoes. A train
load or more of potatoes leaves Prince Edward
Island every day for other parts of Canada
and the United States. The cheap prices at
which they are sold must be having some
little bearing on the economy of the cities
where they are consumed. But there has been
no reduction in the farmers' costs of producing
potatoes. Last year they paid as high as $46
a ton for fertilizer. They paid the regular
price for their farm machinery, for sprayers
and spraying materials, for labour in harvesting the potatoes, and for the bags in which
the potatoes are placed. Consequently, the
potatoes are being sold at a big loss, and have
been all winter long. There is no way under
this bill for compensating farmers for their
loss on potatoes already sold. And I may say
that, despite the low prices, there is no attempt
to hold on to stocks.
It is very unfair te require farmers to
provide at less than cost the food that the
rest of the people live on, while farm machinery, motor cars, tractors and other things
produced by organized labour and required
by farmers are kept at high prices. As we all
know, in times of high prices organized labour
gets its wages raised as high as possible and
endeavours to keep them there. The same is
true of civil servants employed by the federal
government and by all the provinces.
As I see it, this is one of the fairest bills

for potatoes, I know that one year I had a see no reason why it should not pass.
In my judgment the bill is unsound in principle, because it calls upon one class of business, which may be profitable, to make up the
deficiencies of some other business which may
or may not be profitable. I know that the
farmers have some cause for complaint. There
has been unjust and unsound legislation in
effect in Canada which has been adverse to
the farming population. For instance, the
customs laws which have required our
farmers to pay city manufacturers for
machines which they use, more than those
machines were worth on the world market,
were an unjust interference between farmer
and manufacturer, to the benefit of the manufacturer. I have voiced that opinion on many
occasions. There are other things that farmers
may complain about; but one mistake does not
justify another, and the farmers should not
seek to recoup themselves through unsound
legislation which may be in their favour.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: We will take a cash
settlement.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, that is a sell-out,
and I do not like selling out when it is wrong
in principle.
I am not going to make any lengthy speech
on this matter. My views on legislation of
this kind have been expressed here on many
occasions and are well known to the house.
I simply do not believe in allowing departments of government to interfere beyond the
proper function of government in the econornic life of our country. I have held as a
principle, and hold now, that it is not the function of government to set prices, to interfere
in business or to take part in business. That
is the job of private individuals, and I can see
nothing but harm to Canada in legislation like
this.
As honourable senators well know, I am
not in favour of a controlled economy, and
this bill is a major step straight in that direction. It gives to the god that resides in Ottawa,
the State, the right to say what one person
shall pay and another person shall receive,
aside entirely from market conditions. I do
not believe in that. I can see no permanent
good coming out of this measure, and I regret
to see that the legislation is becoming permanent in this country.

on the wheat profits up to that time, and they
amounted to only twenty cents a bushel. A
report which was presented the other day
indicated that the twenty cents included flot
only the profits to the end of July, 1949, but
also $5,225,000 in excess of the proceeds from
wheat sales up to that time.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Was this payment of 20
cents made just before the election?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. The payment at the
rate of 20 cents per bushel, which. was macle
between April and June, amounted to more
than the sum standing to the credit of the
Wheat Board at that time. In fact, the Board
had an overdraft of around five and a quarter
million dollars.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: And had to pay interest
on it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The whole case for this bill,
as the farmers would put it, is this: "You took
from us the wheat we owned and which. was
in our granaries, and you sold it at these
reduced prices. As a resuit, we lost a great
deal of money. You owe us some compensation."
There are evidences that the market for
wheat will soon contract. How soon the
shrinkage will take place we cannot tell; it
ail depends on the American Marshall plan.
If aid under that plan is cut off in the near
future, I do not believe that Canada will be
able t0 dispose of ber wheat even at giveaway prices, for nobody wiil have the money
to buy it. That is the situation, and the
prospect.
This legisiation, therefore, is to partiaily
recompense the farmers for losses on products
which were sold for them at less than the
then standard prices. For that reason, and
that only, I arn willing to vote for the bill. I
quite agree with the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and the honourable gentleman fromn Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) that for every interference on
our part with the economnic laws there is a
penalty to be paid; and I admit that today we
are paying the penalty.
I go further, and say that nobodýy seems
willing to tell the public what we are actually
doing. People do not seemn to understand it.
They say, "Well, the government will pay
this money." Where does the government's
money come from? Anyone who sat in the
House of Commons yesterday during the
speech of a very distinguished gentleman who
told us we had to provide so many millions
to carryon the public business, can be under
no misapprehiension on that point. It has
to come out of taxes.
55950-131

As I said, I intend to vote for the bill. But
if I and my honourable friends fromn TorontoTrînity and Churchill should be alive five
years hence, and we are in trouble over the
consequences of this legisiation, I hope they
will not get Up here and say: "Well, you
voted for the bill. We did not; we talked
against it and voted against it." My position
in this: because four years ago I consented to
an interference with the laws of economics,
I have got to go on to the end of the chapter.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: There is no alternative.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As f ar as I can see there is
no alternative. Once we take the first step
we must go on. I may be told that that is
not sound philosophy. But people cannot so
easily turn, aflter repenting of their sins, and
start on a new road. I repented my sins; I
repented at the time; I was aware that
legisiative interference of this kind was
economically unsound.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:, You repented by
anticipation!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I had to. I'foresaw that tbis
legislation would remnain in Cffect for years.
It has lasted much longer than I expected it
would. In making thîs provision for the producers, Canada is acknowledging that they
macle a real sacrifice, and is trying to cornpensate them in a small way for what they
have lost.
Han. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, as
I dcl not foresee that this bill would be before
us today, I had not expected to say anything
with regard to it. But there are involved i
this legislation certain principles of which,
it seems to me, not sufficient cognizance is
taken either by the government or by those
who are speaking in favour of the measure.
The only argument that has been macle ini
support of it-and to me it is not at all convincing-is that the farmers, having suffered
a heavy loss because some years ago they were
paid for their wheat less per bushel than the
market price, and therefore lost hundreds of
millions of dollars-I think the estimate of
two billion dollars by the honourable member from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is
grossly exaggeratedHon. Mr. Asellin.: That is for everything.
Hon. Mr. Euler: -should be recompensed
by the enactmnent of this legislation empowering the government to place floor prices under
agricultural products. Surely two wrongs do
not make a right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler- I cannot understand the
attitude of the leader -of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. HaIeig), who is usually pretty logical, g4d

SENATE
with whorn I very often agree, when he says
that although a few years ago when this
legislation was introduced he was opposed to
it, there is no other course open to him than
to vote for the bill. For the life of me I cannot understand that sort of logic. He says
that we, having entered on thiýs road, must
continue along it right down to perdition, or
until the crisis comes, and that then we may
apply some corrective measures. Would it
not be infinitely better to correct our fault
as soon as we see it? Two wrongs do not
make a right. If the principle was wrong
three or four or five years ago, it is wrong
today.
I admit that the farmer did have a grievance. Perhaps it was advisable during the
war to sell Canadian wheat to Britain at
prices lower than the world prices. If that
action was necessary, the loss should have
been borne by all the people of Canada, not
by the farmers alone.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am quite willing to agree
with that argument. And I am not going to
start another row by saying that against the
loss they suffered we could set a good many
other items, by way of payments to the
farmers of Western Canada, which would go
very far to counterbalance the losses of which
they make so much. I might speak of the
Crowsnest Pass railway rates. I might cite
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, under which
millions upon millions of dollars have been
.taken from the taxpayers of Canada and paid
over to the farmers of the western prairies.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What about the coarse
grains that were shipped to Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Very well: I have said that
two wrongs do not make a right. Granted the
losses which I have mentioned, I do not think
that the way to compensate for them is
through this bill. While I might go so far as
to admit that something should be done to
compensate the farmers for the losses they
suffered, I complain of this legislation because
it is an attempt to fasten on the people of
this country obligations which are to stand
for all time, and because it is a direct violation of the principles for which 1, for one,
stand. I firmly believe that if the individual
enterprise system is to be preserved, we cannot have this sort of thing. I am dead against
the principle of subsidies. It has been applied
in many directions, but in nearly every case
to the products of the f arm.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What is tariff protection
for manufacturers but a subsidy?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Again, two wrongs do not
make a right. I say, in all good faith and

kindness, that I am getting just a little bit
tired of hearing about the troubles of certain sections of the people, and of the group
pressure upon governments-to which they
are too prone to yield-for favours which
other groups do not receive.
I am not going to deliver a speech on a
subject which is probably tiresome to you,
but you cannot get a better illustration of
group pressure than in the case of margarine.
The budget which was brought down last
night has been described as an "ice cream
budget" because it removed the sales tax from
ice cream. I suppose this was done because
the dairy farmers wanted to sell more cream.
I am not opposed to the removal of this sales
tax, because ice cream is more or less a food;
but I leave it to anyone here to deny that
margarine is more of a food than ice cream.
The sales tax was removed from ice cream,
so it certainly should have been removed
from margarine, thereby reducing its price by
possibly three cents a pound.
I object to making this sort of legislation
permanent. I was opposed in principle to a
good deal of the legislation passed during the
war, but I am ready to admit that it was
perhaps necessary. But it is five years now
since the end of the war, and here we are
taking what was supposed to be temporary
war-legislation, and fastening it upon oui
people permanently.
I sympathize with my honourable friend
from Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour) if he has
trouble with his potatoes. I wish he could
sell them and make a profit; but I should
like to ask him in all kindness, regardless of
the bit of hard luck he is having with his
potato crop, if there is any good reason why
the ordinary taxpayers of this country should
have to reach down into their pockets to help
him out? If this is fair why then should not
every other group or class be entitled to the
same consideration from the government?
Let me mention, if you like, the poor
despised manufacturer. I hold no brief for
him, nor am I opposed to the farmer. But
let us take a manufacturer in my town or
your town who employs, shall we say, three
to five hundred people. He is producing good
merchandise, but he falls upon hard times and
cannot sell his goods. Then he has to lay off
his help, and they become unemployed and
dependent upon the good will of their municipality. Now, why would this manufacturer
not be just as much entitled to federal assistance as the farmer? If you help out the
farmer, you will have to do the same for the
fisherman, and almost everybody else. If
you start this sort of thing, you might just
as well have government ownership of

there is no problem, but there would be a
seious problem if we allowed our surpluses
to remain here unsold. Because of political
situations certain countries have each established a single purchasing agency, and the
only effective way by which we can trade with
these countries is through a governmentsupported single vending agency.
Much as I dislike this legislation, and
though I believe it is basically wrong and
that full economic recovery will not be made
until individuals and corporations in one
country can deal with individuals and corporations in any other country, I feel that we
must have a single vending agency in order
to resist pressure on the part of the single
purchasing agency in any other country to
force down prices of our products. The design
of this legislation is to protect the people of
Canada in that way, and that is altogether
different from the former design, when the
legislation was intended to be temporary.
No one can accuse me of liking government
controls or of being opposed to private enterprise. The success of the greatest and most
powerful nations in the world today has been
built up on private enterprise. But economic
conditions which in this and other countries
were necessarily controlled during the war
have not returned to normal even yet, and
we must deal with them realistically, in the
light of the most reliable information before
us. I think that this legislation, permanent
in nature, will assure our people that should
it at any time become necessary to solidify
the price of any product at, shall we say, a
subsistence level, a government agency will
be able to step in and by purchases drain off
the surplus from the market so that the law
of supply and demand will be able to come
into operation and regulate the price for the
remainder of the product. That is another
object of this legislation. It is not a nefarious
or under-hand measure, and it is not designed
to transfer more power into the hands of the
government. It is just an honest attempt to
prevent conditions operating outside of
Canada from seriously endangering our economic life of our people.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the motion is for the second reading of this
bill. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time. on division.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) intimaied, when explaining the

bill, that he had certain amendments to propose, and I would suggest that we perhaps
could deal with them most expeditiously by
going into Committee of the Whole and then
reporting back to the house. In that way we
might be able to give third reading to the
bill today.
I would therefore move that the bill be
referred to the Committee of the Whole
House.

Hon. Mr. Pirie: Honourable senators, I think
this bill should be referred to a standing
committee. It deals with a very important
matter, and there are several angles which
I should like to have explained. I do not
wish to prolong debate here this afternoon.
Is there any reason why the bill could not be
sent to a standing committee and dealt with
by it tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: There is no reason
except shortage of time. We have two other
measures to get through by tomorrow night.
If my friend wishes to have this bill sent to
a standing committee, the committee would
probably have to meet this evening.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Let it meet.

Hon. Mr. Pirie: I am interested in the
mechanics of the legislation. I heard an
honourable gentleman from Prince Edward
Island (Hon. Mr. Barbour) say here today
that potatoes from that province were being
disposed of at 36 cents a bushel, which means
a price of about 90 or 95 cents for a 165-pound
barrel. That is a very low price. This legislation has been in effect for some time and
I should like to know what the government
has done to try to prevent the price from
falling so low. There are a number of angles
having to do with the mechanics of the legislation that I should like to take up in committee, and therefore I feel the reference
should be to a standing committee. I do not
want to oppose the measure if I can get
satisfactory answers to my questions.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Obviously, I am in the
hands of the house. If I move that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, it will be understood
that the committee is to meet this evening?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If that meets with the
approval of the house, I would withdraw my
previous motion and now move that this bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If the motion carries, I
will take it as definite notice that the committee is to meet this evening at eight o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.

FELICITATIONS TO HON. MR. HOWARD

SENATE
On Monday evening, March 20, the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) gave an interesting talk in this
house. I should perhaps apologize for being
absent from the chamber that evening, but
since my appointment to the Senate I have
missed only two sittings of the house.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You are forgiven.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: The honourable
senator moved second reading of Bill G, an
Act to incorporate the Ukrainian National
Federation. Had I been here I would have
given my approval to this bill, and would
have paid tribute to the contribution which
the Ukrainian people have made to the settlement of Alberta.
I arrived in Alberta in 1905, and I found
my nearest neighbours, who were Ukrainians,
very fine people. When that province was
being settled, the average American and
Britisher took up land on the open prairie,
but the Ukrainian settler chose an area where
there was more bush. This land was more
difficult to clear, and it took more time to
get started, but in the end the judgment of
these people proved to 1ge sound. The soil
of the average bushla8d which borders the
prairie is better tha 1 4hat of the prairie,
by reason of moreyfiq
, and the Ukrainian
settlers have profitglfrqm it. On the whole
they have workedharg. to "prove up" their
homesteads, and ;thayghave made a great
contribution to the buildin up of the province
:Tuuteri
D
of Alberta.
I should like :ïow *'L¥efer to some statements made by the hon'burable member from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) on March 20
last, and in this connection I wish to read an
excerpt from page 101 of Hansard.
Let me point out here that the government by
seizing the halls of another Ukrainian group, made
Communists out of many Ukrainians, This was one
of the government's bigger blunders. Not content
with locking their halls and leaving them unoccupied, they decided to seize and dispose of them for
a fraction of what they were worth. Many Ukrainians turned in disgust against the government
because of this action.

I disagree with that statement. In my
opinion
the
loyal Ukrainians heartily
approved of this action, and the greatly
increased Liberal vote in the Vegreville constituency at the last election is proof of my
contention.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I would now refer to
some statements made by the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
on March 20, as reported in Hansard, page
102. He said:
I want also to say a word with regard to Mr.
Hlynka, the former member of parliament for

which he was returned, a Communist ran against
him and received, nearly 4,000 votes. Because of
Mr. Hlynka's fine work in Edmonton and all over
the country in opposition to Communism, these
people-

Speaking of the Communists.
-decided, not to put forward a candidate last year,
but to vote Liberal in order to defeat him, and this
they succeeded in doing. Government supporters
may take what satisfaction they can from the fact
that Communists helped to elect the Liberal in
Vegreville. I was in the district afterwards and,
knowing what a fine fellow had been defeated, tried
to find out the reason. This is the explanation I
got.

Hon. Mr. Leger: I am just wondering-the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake is not
here-whether the honourable senator from
Bruce is not reading from a speech on a
motion which has already been adopted.
The Hon. the Speaker: I have not before me
the text of the speech of the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake, but I am inclined
to think that he was speaking on the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. If,
however, the quotation by the honourable
senator from Bruce is from a speech made
upon some other motion, I would hold that
the point of order is well taken, because there
can be no discussion of a matter which is
already closed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The speech of the honourable senator from Blaine Lake was on another
bill.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Then I will not quote
any more from that speech.
Hon. Mr. Leger: The speech from which the
honourable senator from Bruce is quoting was
on a motion of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Not being familiar
with the rules of this house, I stand corrected.
Am I allowed to quote what the honourable
senator said at that time?
Hon. Mr. Duff: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not from something which
was said in a previous debate on another
matter.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable gentleman
can quote it next year, but not this year.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: He has already
quoted it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He cannot quote it in the
same session.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Then I will see what
else I can do about it. I am on my own now,
I am not quoting anybody.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

MARCH 29, 1950
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: What I wish to do is
to speak about the election in the Vegreville
constituency.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The honourable member has a perfect right to do so.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: In the Vegreville constituency several thousand Communist votes
were cast in 1945 for the Labour-Progressive
candidate. At that time the Labour-Progressive movement in Alberta was new; it must
not be forgotten that Russia was then our ally;
and it was not unusual to hear words of praise
of that courageous nation that was holding
back the Nazis. That being so, in my mind
there is no doubt that many people in the
Vegreville district were somewhat confused
and probably somewhat misinformed as to
the character of the Labour-Progressive
movement. In 1949 the voters' list of Vegreville constituency contained several thousand
additional names, but actually about a
thousand less people voted at the election. If
anyone will examine the record he will find
that the polls in which the vote in 1949 was
smaller than in 1945 were those which in 1945
had the heaviest Communist votes. It therefore
appears to me that last year many of the real
Communists did not vote at all; and I doubt
very much if there are now more than a
thousand communists in that riding. However,
in the 1949 election there was no Labour-Progressive, no CCF and no Conservative candidate, so these various parties could either line
up with Mr. Decore, the Liberal candidate,
or Mr. Hlynka, the Social-Credit candidate,
or not vote at all. And this is just what a
large number of voters must have done,
because, as I said before, although there were
many more names on the voters' list, a
thousand fewer votes were cast.
I am personally acquainted in the Vegreville constituency, which is only twelve miles
from the farm where I live. I worked in that
constituency before and during the election. I
know a fairly large number of Conservatives
in the Vegreville constituency, though it
appears that the main aggregation of Conservatives is in the district from which my
honourable colleague from Calgary (Hon. Mr.
Ross) comes. Calgary is a little different from
any other place. I might digress for a moment
to say that two of the most promising politicians Canada has ever known came from
Calgary-anyway, they made the most
promises-namely the Right Hon. R. B.
Bennett and Mr. Aberhart. Certainly Mr.
Aberhart out-promised anybody I ever heard
of: I think he made more promises than all
the party politicians since confederation, and
he never kept any of them.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It brought results, though.
55950-14

Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I have said that I am
personally acquainted with many Conservatives in the Vegreville constituency, and with
one exception al of them worked and voted
for the Liberal candidate, Mr. Decore. These,
I submit, are Conservatives who may properly
be called Progressive Conservatives.
A word as to Mr. Hlynka, the Social Credit
candidate. In the 1949 campaign, Mr. Hlynka
advertised in the Ukrainian language that he
had helped deserters and had also aided
young men to escape the draft. He also
toured the constituency with two DP's, who
had been in this country only a short time
and who exhorted the people to "vote for
Hlynka." What an insult to the intelligence
of the people in the Vegreville constituency!
These loyal people rightly and properly
repudiated Mr. Hlynka as well as Social
Credit.
Hon. Mr. Euler. May I interrupt my honourable friend? I do not like to do so, because
this is his maiden speech. But he has just
mentioned Social Credit. Like many others, I
believe, I have never quite understood the
theory of Social Credit, and since my friend
comes from a province in which it is so politically active, would he explain very briefly
what it means, both in theory and practice, in
Alberta.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Well, that is a fair
question. I must admit that I do not understand Social Credit. I never knew anybody
who did. It is pure theory, fanatically held,
and fanciful. There is nothing practical about
it: it has never been tried.
Hon. Mr. Howden: What about the promise
of $25 a month?
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: If honourable senators
would like it, I could go into that a bit. Social
Credit was introduced into Alberta by Mr.
Aberhart, the man who made so many promises. Let me tell you about some of them. He
promised at least $25 a month-and he said
that he saw no reason why he could not pay
$75 a month-to every adult person in the
province. He claimed that he would do not
only this but that he would not take anything
away from anybody. He promised to hand
out all this money and to abolish taxation.
So the real theory of Social Credit is, of
course, that you give something for nothing.
Mr. Aberhart read a book by Mr. Douglas,
who, as far as I know never made a success of
anything in the Old Country. Nevertheless,
Douglas expounded this theory, and Mr.
Aberhart took it up, enlarged upon it and
went before the people of Alberta, and was
elected in 1935.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 1934.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: It was August 22,
1935. I can remember that very well.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Was he ever defeated?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: No, he died.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Has his party ever been
defeated?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Not yet. Now, I suppose a lot of you people down here wonder
why Social Credit ever took hold in Alberta.
I shall tell you. You probably think it is
some sort of a child's disease, something like
the measles, and possibly it is. I do not think
there is anything serious in measles themselves, but sometimes their after effects are
very serious. I know people who are suffering
in adult life because they had measles as a
child; and in the same way there are going to
be aftereffects in Alberta because of this Social
Credit government.
In 1937 there was quite a rebellion within
the ranks of the Social Credit party. Before
he was elected in 1935 Mr. Aberhart had
promised that he would bring in this system of
Social Credit and would start to pay dividends
within eighteen months. As he had done nothing to implement this promise by 1937, many
of his party followers rebelled because they
had taken him at his word. When this uprising
was at its height in the Alberta legislature, one
of the Social Credit lady members turned to
the rebels and said, "You should be ashamed
of yourselves. Mr. Aberhart took most of you
off the bread line". This will give you a pretty
fair idea of the success these legislators had
previously enjoyed in ordinary walks of life. I
remember Mr. Hlynka once said to me,
"Stambaugh, I could go out on a platform and
beat you all to pieces arguing the theory of
Social Credit". I replied, "I am not interested in theories; I am interested in facts, and
as there are no facts to prove the merits of
Social Credit there can be no argument".
Hon. Mr. Duff: Did he beat you on that
occasion?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: We did not argue
because I wanted to stick to facts and he
wanted to stick to theories. There was no
common ground for argument.
Honourable senators, in closing I should like
to pay tribute to the member for Vegreville,
in another place, who spoke so strenuously
against communism both on and off the platform. I should also like to pay tribute to the
fine, intelligent people of the Vegreville constituency, who along with the rest of Canada
realized that the real bulwark against communism is the Liberal party.
The Address was adopted.

ADJOURNMENT-MORNING SITTING
Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved:
That when this house adjourns it stand adjourned
until tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock.

He said: Before we adjourn for the Easter
recess it is desirable that we give third reading to the Agricultural Prices Support Bill and
to two other bills yet to come before us. Therefore, I think it would meet the convenience of
honourable members if we gave third reading
to Bill 17 tomorrow morning, so that we
would have the remainder of the day in
which to deal with the other two bills to
which I have referred.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I should like to say a word
before my honourable friend, the deputy
leader, adjourns the house. This is Wednesday,
March 29, and it seems to me that it is about
time somebody in authority informed the
house when our Easter recess is going to start
and finish. Most of us in this chamber are
businessmen, and while we are of course glad
to corne here and help look after the affairs
of the country, we feel our own interests
should not be neglected. It seems to me that
somebody is falling down badly on his job.
As far as I am concerned I am going to leave
tomorrow afternoon and it does not make any
difference to me whether the Senate continues
to sit or not; but the deputy leader should
inform the house now when we are going to
adjourn for Easter. He will probably tell us
that we are going to meet tomorrow and
Friday, but that is not sufficient.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: All I can say is that the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
is expected to return here tonight, and I
think my honourable friend's question will
be answered then. I would suggest to him
that, in order to make certain he gets this
information, he attend the meeting of the
Banking and Commerce Committee at 8
o'clock this evening.
Hon. Mr. Duff: My honourable friend is not
being fair. There is no reason I should
attend a meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committee to obtain information which
should be divulged in this chamber by himself
or the leader. We should have been given
this information long ago. I have been trying to secure railway reservations for
tomorrow or Friday from Donald Gordon, the
man who is now running the C.N.R., but who
should never have been appointed. Alistair
Fraser should have been appointed-but that
is neither here nor there.
My honourable friend the deputy leader
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) looks wonderfully
serious, and I would like him to announce
when the Senate is to adjourn and when we

The Hon. the Speaker: I understand that

answer, and I think that even though pressed
he would not give a different one.

55950-141.

The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the third reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not want to delay the

During the

discussion

on

the

motion for the second reading of the bill,

allusion was made to the number of orders
in council which had been made, and it was
admitted that, although these orders are
being gathered together with a view to the
preparation of a compendium or some sort
of list, no complete list is available at the
present time. I suggest to the leader of the
government that between now and next
session he request the department to prepare a complete officiai list, and that an
amendment setting out that list be then
presented.
This is not a contentious question. At the
present time if you go to a library or a law
office to obtain a list of all the orders which
have been passed under these regulationsand by all of which you are bound-you
have no assurance that the list you got
will be complete. The case is somewhat analogous to that of the Dominion statutes. When
one is looking for amendments to existing
legislation, the consolidation of 1927 makes
it unnecessary to go back earlier than that
year.
I repeat, there should be a list or schedule
attached to the Act which will enbrace all
orders up to the present time. Otherwise,
when people come into my office, or into
the office of any other lawyer, for information on this matter, we have to admit, "For
the life of us we can't tell you whether the
information is complete or not."
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
it goes without saying that I shall direct
the attention of the government to the suggestion made by my honourable friend. I
well recall, as no doubt all honourable members do, the discussion which took place on
the second reading of this bill. At the
moment the departmental officials are preparing a compendium of all the orders in
council having the force of legislation effective as of and up to December 31 last,
and I understand my honourable friend's
suggestion to be that next year amending
legislation should formally declare that the
orders in council embodied in that compendium or book, when it is produced, do
in fact constitute all the orders in council
having the force of legislation as at December 31st last.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I shall direct the suggestion to the government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.

Hon. Mr. Marcotte: But would such a compilation be binding on the courts? I ask that
because in Saskatchewan, where I am practising, we once had a certain compilation of
statutes; but as it contained certain statutes
which had been repealed, the courts held,

MARCH 30, 1950
when this was discovered, that it was not
binding. So I would suggest that if a compendium is made there should be a provision
that it will be binding on the courts.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think that is what
was intended by the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig)-that legislation should

rid of wartime controls in as orderly a manner
as possible. In this connection, the Supreme
Court of Canada recently gave a unanimous
decision upholding the validity of wartime
legislation relating to leasehold regulation,
but, as the Chief Justice said when judgment
was delivered, there is no doubt that under
normal conditions the subject-matter of rents
belongs to provincial jurisdiction. Accordingly,
the only limitation to the government's proposal as contained in this amending bill would
seem to be an unseen limitation-what may
or may not be regarded at any time as a
national emergency. Certainly it is to be
hoped that the supply of labour and materials
will be adjusted more closely than in the
past few years to the public need of buildings
in areas where they are most required. In
connection with other matters which have
come before this house it has been observed
that we have reason to think that on almost
the entire economic front production is catching up with, and even actually exceeding, the
demands of our people for various commodities and services. Certainly we hope that that
condition will apply generally in 1951 in the
field of rental housing.
The discussion which took place in the other
house relating to the application of the provisions of the Act, as amended, during the
next thirteen months, need not, I suggest, be
repeated here. The objective of the bill is to
do away with rental control by April 1951.
Therefore the suggestion that a special statute
be passed to explain in detail how the legislation is to be applied seerns somewhat beside
the mark. At any rate there is satisfaction
in knowing that the bill was approved unanimously in the other place last evening; and
I trust that this house may consent to it
receiving third reading without reference to a
committee.
Hon. Mr. King: Was it not the decision of
the Supreme Court that the question of continuation of control would be left to the judgment of parliament, and does this Act not
confirm their judgment with respect to the
retirement of the government from such
control?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That, I think, in effect is
correct. The Supreme Court of Canada in no
way attempted to usurp the function of
parliament to decide what course would be
necessary, but it did uphold the validity of
the leasehold regulations which have been in
force, on the ground that they were for the
general good of Canada. It also held that
under ordinary conditions jurisdiction in the
matter of rental housing rested with the
provinces.
My point is that if in the spring of 1951 it
were the opinion of parliament, based on

evidence, that there was still a national emergency and that the general good of Canada
would be served by the imposition of rent
control, this bill might come here again for
renewal. But our hope, and, I am quite sure,
the hope of the Minister as explicitly
expressed in the other place, is that thirteen
months from now the end of rental controls
under federal jurisdiction will be realized.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is rental control the only
control now remaining with the government?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to ask the honourable member from Ottawa a question. I followed the debate in another place, and I did
not hear any suggestion there to the effect
of the statement he has just made. I wondered
whether he was announcing a change of
policy, because the Minister and all the
speakers in the other place, at least on the
government side, stated that this was the end
of controls.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: That is right.
Hon. Mr. King: That is the intention.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it was not "the intention". The statement was that this is the
end.
I am not Éure that my honourable friend
has rightly interpreted the judgment of the
Supreme Court. I think the court held that
when, because of the existence of an emergency such as prevailed during the war,
certain emergency powers were exercised, the
question of when that emergency was over
was for the judgment of parliament. I believe
the court clearly acknowledged that-without
an original basis of urgency-the Parliament
of Canada had no power to deal with rent
controls; and the minister in charge of this
legislation has intimated in another place
that at the end of the period referred to in
this measure, rent controls will be discontinued, and he recommends that any province
which wishes to have the controls continued
should institute thern itself.
I hope that the words of my honourable
friend from Ottawa are not an indication
that parliament may be asked to continue
these controls. I feel sure that the other house
voted for the measure in the belief that this
was the last time the Act would be extended,
and if I vote for the bill I will do so on the
understanding that I am attending the
funeral of rent controls. I want to be sure
of that. I do not want anyone to notify us
later that the corpse came back to life. The
chief medical officer for the legislation-the
minister-has certified that the patient is
dead and can be buried, and I hope we shall
not be told next year that the doctor was

MARCH 30, 1950
wrong, that the patient is alive and should
not be buried at ail. My honourable friend
seems to be appearing at this solemn service
in the role of a mid-wife.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I thought you said this
was a funeral.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but I am afraid this
legislation may have a new birth.
Personally, I have always been bitterly
opposed to rent controls, and I think that
their history right from the beginning has
shown that they are futile.
Let me tell a story of a little incident that
happened last summer. A man and his wife
who live on Broadway in the city of Winnipeg came to a friend of mine and told him
they were voting for the Liberal party. My
friend said, "I thought you were CCFers."
They replied, "So we are, but we think the
Liberal party is the only one that will continue
rent controls." I have not been able to see
this friend since this bill was announced, for
I have been here, but I was speaking to him
at Christmas, after the statement by the Minister of Finance that owners of domestie property were to be allowed to increase their
rents by 18 and 22 per cent, and he suggested that the man and his wife had decided
to vote for the CCF again and to continue to
do so in future.
My honourable friend from Ottawa, says he
hopes that the supply of labour and materials
will increase to the point of making it possible
to build more houses. The fact is, that labour
and materials are available now, but that
houses are not being built for rent-either
individual houses or apartment housesexcept where the government puts up the
necessary money and guarantèes that the
builder will get a certain revenue over a
period of years. I am sorry that my honourable friend from Ottawa suggested the possibility that rent control may again be invoked,
for as long as this threat exists there will not
be enough dwellings built for rental purposes.
There is no question about that.
Of course, even today the problem is not so
much one of shortage of labour and building
materials as of inability on the part of most
would-be tenants to pay a rent high enough
to give a reasonable return on the cost of the
houses that could be built. A house that sold
for $3,500 in 1938 is worth $7,000 today, and
the owner has to charge a sufficient rent to
bring in reasonable interest on $7,000.
Besides, taxes have gone up tremendously,
in two ways-by increased assessment and
increased tax rates. In Winnipeg the present
assessment on a house that would have been
assessed at $3,500 in 1938 is perhaps $7,000,
and the tax rate has gone up from 38 mills

on the dollar-I speak subject to correctionto about 44 mills. And remember, honourable senators, that the increase of 6 mills
applies to the doubled assessment.
Rent control has not made it easier for people with low incomes to obtain housing. The
man who would invest his money in houses
for rent was prohibited from getting a higher
return than he was getting in 1937, although
business people and farmers were allowed to
use current values on their properties as a
basis for the return of profits. Consequently,
people who ordinarily would invest their
small savings in the construction of houses
have turned to other kinds of investment. It
always was a custom in Canada for many
people who owned their own homes to save up
their money until they could buy another
house-usually in the same neighbourhood,
with which they were familiar-and later on
still another, and so on, in the hope that by
the time they retired they would receive
from these properties a sufficient income to
provide for their old age, at least in part. It
is true that since 1917 a good many of our
people who are able to save amounts of from
$500 to $1,000 yearly have been purchasing
government bonds; but certainly prior to
that time the bulk of these savings used to be
invested in residential property.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is still the custom
in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It may be, but this legislation made it impossible for people to build
houses for rent, because they were prohibited
from obtaining reasonable interest on their
money. The control in effect placed a special
tax on every man and woman who had money
invested in rented dwellings.
When- it was suggested that the provinces
could, if they so desired, take over rent control, I noticed that my own province of Manitoba promptly sidestepped the issue. Maybe
there will be a provincial control later on,
but I have grave doubts about it. So far the
only province that has made a definite move
towards imposing rent control is Saskatchewan, whose government is CCF.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: What about Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It has not done anything.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It said it would.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, it has not done anything yet.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It has not had time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes it has.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Alberta also intimated that
it nilght impose controls.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Haig: What Alberta proposed was
a different thing altogether, namely, the setting up of a board to which owners and
tenants could apply for the fixing of proper
rents. If such a board were set up, and acted
fairly, it would no doubt allow a fair return
on the basis of present day costs.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: New houses do not
come under this Act at all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that. The point I
am making is that my honourable friend from
Ottawa was wrong in suggesting that an
increased supply of labour and building materials would make available more houses for
rent, I say this will not happen, because most
people who are looking for houses to rent
cannot afford to pay a rent high enough to
-ield a good return on the cost of new build.ngs. There is no question about that. Every
day you hear people saying that they cannot
afford to pay the rents that are demanded
for new houses.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Will my honourable
friend allow me? My point was that general
economic conditions which, as we emphasized
yesterday, are bringing about an accumulation of food surpluses, will undoubtedly apply
soon to building materials, and that it will
be possible to build houses more cheaply next
year than it is now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend is
more optimistic than I am. I do not know
how in the world the cost of labour is going
to come down.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Or the cost of building
materials either.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have been interested in
the building industry for many years, and
I know that whenever wages rise-as they
did in, say the period from 1919 to 1922-they
never go back to their former level. At times
there have been some little "shenanigans"if I may use that word-whereby wage rates
appear to be maintained when in reality they
are not. For instance, suppose the hourly
rate for plasterers is $1.10 and that it takes
a man one hundred hours to plaster a certain
type of house. A builder might make a contract with four or five plasterers to do the
work on a number of such houses at an average cost of $50 or $60. These plasterers
would earn at the work only 50 or 60 cents
an hour; they would be regarded as contractors and so technically would not be looked
upon as plasterers who had worked for less
than the regular wage.
In the United States there are two or three
organizations which study the price levels
that have applied over the last 150 years. I
have listened to some of their experts. They
have found that every fifteen years, on the

average, there has been a rise and a fall in
the price of houses; that the level would rise
for seven or eight years and then decline for
seven or eight years. But the cost has never
fallen as low as it was before, and it has
always moved higher again. My explanation
of this is that it is easier to sell a house for
$8,000, for instance, and leave labour costs as
they are than to cut costs in order to reduce
the selling price to $7,000.
Rent control is a political weapon which
has been used by those in power because there
are more tenants than owners; but the very
people it was sought to help through this
legisiation are the ones who in the long run
must suff er the most, because now hardly any
low-priced housing is being built, and none is
for sale or for rent at a price these persons
can afford to pay.
In 1941, when rent control was introduced,
it was less stringent than it become later on.
At that time, if property were sold, the tenant
could be forced to vacate. Later came a provision, as rigid as cast iron, that he could not
be removed at all. I am delighted to have
the opportunity to vote for this legislation.
The vote I shall cast in a minute or two will
be given more happily than any I have previously cast in this house.
An Hon. Senator: That covers a long time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In my opinion, which I
think is shared by every other honourable
member, by this vote we shall do more for
the people of Canada than we as an assembly
have ever been able to do before. People
will build houses to rent when they know
that they can control their own properties,
and will not be thwarted by somebody who,
once in occupation, cannot be made to get out.
May I illustrate my meaning with a personal experience? I owned a house on Chestnut street, Winnipeg. My wife, my daughter
and I lived in it. We sold it, and it is now
occupied by twelve people, for whom it provides reasonably good accommodation. But
could I get possession of another house I
owned, worth only half as much? No, because
it was subject to rent control. That sort of
thing is characteristic of the whole control
system throughout its cycle of operations.
I congratulate the Minister of Finance upon
his attitude in this matter. He was well
advised when he excluded from control all
new properties. His judgment was equally
good when, about a year ago last December,
he decided that, upon a tenant vacating a
house or apartment, controls ceased to apply.
I did not agree-though I admit many of my
friends did-that the rental boost last December was a good move, and I will tell you why.
It was not that those who rent houses are,
even now, paying too much, but the change

MARCH 30, 1950
was made at the wrong time of the year.
In my opinion, rather than permit rents to be
raised during the winter, an announcement
should have been made last September that
rent control legislation would expire on the
30th of June of the present year. I do not
say this in a spirit of criticism; I think that
what he did was a tactical mistake.
Let me give one more experience. I know
of a twenty-three suite block in Winnipeg,
owned by people who live in Brandon.
Under rent control, suites on the south side
and on the first and second floors were rented
at $51.75 per month; for other suites the rents
charged were $48.50 and $45. Thus, three
categories of rents were under control, except
that when tenants moved out the owner
could for their successors, increase the rent
22 per cent. Twenty-two per cent on $51 is
about $11, which would make the rent about
$61.50. These owners said to their agent,
"We will increase the rents 7 per cent, and
we will use the proceeds to decorate the
building." Every one of the tenants renewed
his lease. I believe that this incident is
typical of the great bulk of landlords. I know
there are exceptions, for some people are
grasping; but landlords must always remember that times change, and conditions with
them, and if they treat their tenants well they
are not likely to lose them.
I repeat that I am glad to vote for the bill,
and I hope it will pass unanimously.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: I wish to say a word
or two with reference to some remarks of the
honourable leader of the opposition as to an
inference he drew from the speech of the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) and from the bill itself. If I correctly understood the honourable senator from
Ottawa, he definitely said that the main
feature of this bill is that it is to put an end
to rent control in thirteen months from now.
I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that
the language of section 7 is quite explicit. If
this bill is carried, the new section 7 will
read:
This Act shall expire on the thirtieth day of April,
one thousand nine hundred and fifty-one.

This clause replaces the old section 7, which
reads:
. ..

This Act shall expire . ..

on the thirty-first

day of March, one thousand nine hundred and fifty:
. .. provided that, if at any time while this act is
in force, Addresses are presented to the Governor
General by the Senate and House of Commons,
respectively, praying that this Act should be continued in force for a further periôd, not in any
case exceeding one year, from the time at which it
would otherwise expire and the Governor in
Council so orders, this Act shall continue in force
for that further period.

That provision is eliminated from the legislation if what is proposed in this bill becomes
part of the The Continuation of Transitional
Measures Act, 1947.
There could hardly be a more definite indication of the intention of the minister and
those associated with him in the preparation
of this bill, and of the members of the House
of Commons and the Senate, when they pass
the bill, that here is an end of rental controls
so far as this parliament is concerned. No
individual can say that similar legislation will
not be introduced at some time in the future;
but here is a definite end of rental controls at
this time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: A year from now my
honourable friend could introduce the same
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That may be, but it
would not be a re-birth; it would be a
resurrection.

Hon. Mr. Reid: A few minutes ago I asked
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.

Mr. Lambert) if, when this bill is passed, it
will mark the end of the last remaining order
with respect to controls. His answer was yes.
On checking up, I find that this chamber is
not getting all the information that was given
in the House of Commons. When the government was asked about the continuation of
orders in council-which, like rental control,
are under the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board-it was pointed out that a number of
orders in council and regulations remain,
some of them affecting steel, some affecting
timber. But here we are, deliberating only
on rent control, and preparing to rush this
legislation through. I object to that kind of
thing. If information was given in the other
place in the form of a list of all orders in
council pertaining to this matter, we also
should be provided with the facts. I have
before me a House of Commons Hansard,
from which I could quote. There is reference
to these controls on page 1105, and there is a
schedule on page 1106. Then, the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister is reported
as having said:
The actual list of controls which will still be in
effect will appear in a schedule to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honour-

able friend from what he is quoting?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am quoting from Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What page?
Hon. Mr. Reid: 1105.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Of this year?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Of this year, on March 24.
On the following page will be found a number
of orders in council affecting control of timber and steel. All these matters are comprised

SENATE

in the bill, yet this body has been deliberating
solely about rent control, and there is no such
schedule to the bill as was promised in the
House of Commons. In view of these facts,
until I get further information I am going to
object to second reading at this time.
Hon. Thomas Farquhar: It seems to me that
in the remarks he made the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) showed
inconsistency. He said that he was very
happy that rent control would cease in about
a year from now, and that all of us should
be very happy too. The reason he gave for
his satisfaction was that people would build
when they were no longer hampered by
existing restrictions.

quite right in his assumption that by the
thirtieth day of April, 1951, which is about
thirteen months from now, he will be able to
attend at the obsequies of rent control and
raise a cheer, in which I should be willing to
join.
One point that was raised here today had to
do with the reference to the Supreme Court
for the purpose of determining whether, in the
light of present conditions, the jurisdiction
over rental control lay with the federal parliament or with the provincial legislatures. It
was argued before the court that the emergency still exists. Now, how could the court
determine whether or not the emergency continued to exist? It seems to me that an
important point upon which it could base its

leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) is to place before the house, namely, that if

MARCH .30, 1950
parliament declares that an emergency exists,
the Court is bound to take notice of 'that. A
few years ago, when we were considering
legislation affecting the Canadian Wheat
Board, we declared that there was in this
country an emergent condition which made it
necessary for the government-under the
power of parliament to declare works to be
for the general advantage of Canada-to take
control of small grist mills throughout
Western Canada. At the time that certainly
struck me as trenching very far on the property and civil rights jurisdiction of the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I ask my honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If parliament at any
time declares there is an emergency and the
issue is tested before the Supreme Court, has
the court not the right to decide whether
there is or is not an emergency, regardless of
what may have been declared by parliament?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. I suppose it has.
But what I am asking is this: What is to
guide the court when it comes to consider
whether or not there is an emergency? Couild
there be any better evidence that an emergency existed than a declaration to that effect
by parliament? As I remarked earlier, both
houses of parliament comprise representatives
of all parts of Canada who are supposed to
be aware of the conditions existing in their
respective localities; and if in its sober judgment parliament declared that there was an
emergency the court would be bound, I think,
to give very serious weight to such a declaration. My whole -point is this, that whenever
parliament declares the existence of an emergency, whether as to rentals or anything else,
it assumes a very serious responsibility.
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo: Honourable senators,
the answer given to the question asked by
my honourable friend from Provencher (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) has pretty well covered the
point I was going to make. However, I think
it would be appropriate to remind the bouse
that it is .rather dangerous to quote decisions
of Supreme Court Judges without having the
text before you. It has been suggested that,
in a sense, the court abrogated its responsibility of determining whether or not there
was still an emergency justifying the imposition by parliament of rent control. As I
remember the judgments of the various
judges, ýthat is not so; they did not preclude
the possibility that anyone attacking the legislation could satisfy the court that, as a matter
of fact, and notwithstanding the preceding
opinion of parliament, an emergency no
longer existed. If any opponent of the legislation were able to establish to the satisfac-

tion of the court that as a matter of fact an
emergency no longer existed, the court would
be free to hold the legislation was invalid.
However, the combined opinion of representatives of all parts of Canada in both bouses
of parliament that there is an emergency,
together with the decision of the government
that the legislation should be continued, is
undoubtedly a significant fact of itself. But,
as I say, it is not conclusive and it does not
precbide the court from subsequent action
to invalidate the legislation. I think the point
of it is this; that the danger which seems to
impress my honourable friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) is not, perhaps, as great as
he believes it to be. We still have the court
to protect us against a mistaken declaration
of emergency.
I am going to say only one more thing.
Like the honourable gentleman from Algoma
(Hon. Mr. Farquhar) I had a little trouble in
following the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in his argument. It
seemed to me that, to borrow his own terms,
he was confusing the function of a midwife
with that of an undertaker. As I understand
the matter, we are being invited to the funeral
of this legislation: we are given due notice
that as at April of next year it will be ended:
and if at that time any of the provinces and
provincial governments that have been so
ready to criticize the federal government for
mismanagement of rental control want to try
their hand at the same business, the opportunity will be theirs.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They need not wait. They
can do it even now.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: If they wish to, they can
take it over now.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Just one word with
regard to the question of an emergency. The
powers of the Parliament of Canada are
much greater during a state of emergency
than they are under normal conditions. I
share absolutely the opinion so well
expressed by the senator from Carleton (Hon.
Mr. Fogo) that a declaration by the
Parliament of Canada-which, after all, is
a unilateral declaration-is not absolutely
conclusive. It is a presumption, of course,
but the court is still allowed to scrutinize
the exercise of our powers in connection
with this matter. Otherwise, if we were to
take the position that we have absolute
discretion in connection with this declaration
of emergency, we could go even so far as to
declare that there is and always will be,
an emergency.
From a certain standpoint, no doubt, it
was important that the honourable- senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) should
make the remarks which we have just

SENATE
heard. We must exercise our discretion with
the greatest care: we must be, in other
words, in the utmost good faith. Again and
again the Privy Council has affirmed the
principle that neither parliament nor a local
legislature should be allowed to usurp jurisdiction. For instance, if the Canadian Parliament-under the pretence of legislating in a
case of emergency-should try to usurp the
jurisdiction of the provinces in the matter of
civil rights and liberty, such colourable legislation would be ultra vires. As a matter of
fact it would be wholly opposed to the spirit
of the constitution.
In a certain sense, honourable members,
we are, I think, this morning a very united
family. We believe that this bill will make
an end to rent control; and all our other
remarks, even though quite apropos, do not
eclipse the importance of this first-class
funeral which is now taking place.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I agree entirely with the remarks of the
two honourable gentlemen who have just
preceded me, in reference to what was said
by the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). It is of course perfectly
true that the Parliament of Canada has
the right to declare an emergency; but in
declaring an emergency in order to take over
certain powers which it would not normally
possess, parliament must be in good faith.
In other words, this parliament could not
declare an emergency, when it did not exist,
merely for the purpose of trenching upon
some provincial right.
As my honourable friend from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) has pointed out, it
has attempted to do this on quite a number
of occasions. One instance comes to my
mind. As honourable senators know, on
more than one occasion the Privy Council
has declared that the business of insurance
and insurance contracts is a provincial matter. On one occasion this parliament
attempted to deal with British and foreign
insurance companies carrying on business
in this country, and it purported to control
them on the ground that the question
involved was one of immigration-the immigration of these foreign and British insurance
companies to Canada. The Privy Council
decided at once that the real intent and purport of the legislation had nothing whatever
to do with immigration, but that it was
an attempt to do indirectly what parliament
could not do directly in the way of controlling insurance contracts in tha. country.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: That decision would
apply equally to American companies.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes, to foreign
companies of all kinds.

There is just one thing I want to say in
reply to the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). I think he
has misread that part of the proceedings
of the other house to which he referred. On
page 1106 of the Commons Hansard will be
found a long list of orders in council, divided
into two sections. At the foot of the first
column on page 1106, under heading No. 1,
are the orders in council still in force and
which will remain in force until the end
of April of next year. These are certain
orders of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board having to do with rental control and
certain wartime leasehold regulations. There
are also one or two other very minor orders.
But on turning to the second column of the
same page, under section 2, we find orders in
council revoked by the order in council of
March 14, and these cover the regulations
relating to steel and timber controls, and so
forth, to which the honourable senator referred. So these are out.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then it is clear that only
rental control remains to be dealt with?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Rental control is the
only one that remains, apart from one or
two very minor orders, indicated at the foot
of the first column of page 1106, affecting
some employees under the Government Employees Compensation Act numbering, I
understand, about nine persons. Otherwise
what rental controls remain in effect will
terminate on the ist of April, 1951. I wish
to make this point clear, because I do not
want any honourable member to assume that
under cover of saying that this legislation
is being continued for the purpose of rental
control, we are bringing in anything else.
I was very interested, as I always am, to
listen to my honourable friend the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). Whatever
else may be said, I think my honourable
friend in this matter has the merit of consistency. He has at al times opposed rental
control legislation: he has opposed, it very
eloquently in this house, largely I think on
the ground's he expressed this morning. His
opposition is quite a logical one, and perhaps
all that remains to be said is that the vast
majority of the people of the country have
disagreed with him; that, generally speaking,
public opinion has been that this measure
of control was wisely adopted and administered in the first instance, in the emergency
of war, and that, during the few years after
the war, control and the gradual process of
decontrol have been operated in a reasonable
manner and for the greatest good of the
greatest nunber.
I think my honeurable friend the leader
on the other side misunderstood to some

MARCH 30, 1950
extent what the honourable member fromn
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) said. I do not
think there is any likelihood that the corpse
will be resuscitated on the 30th of April,
1951. The only conceivable reason I can
imagine for the continuation of rent control
after that date would be the arising of a new
emergency, the outbreak of another war or
some other really serious development, of
which we have no advance information. Of
course, when you say you are going to abandon emergency legislation at a certain date,
you always have ta keep in the back of your
mind the possibility that by that date a new
emergency may have arisen.
I think the justification for the federal
government's abandonmient of rent control
as of the end of April next year was very
well expressed by my honourable friend
from Ottawa. There is an increase in the
supply both of labour and of building
materials, and though, as the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) properly remarked, the wages of workmen in the building industry are not likely to decline, we
must remember that in the last few years
labour has become more efficient. Furthermore, while the cost of materials needed for
house construction may not drop appreciably
in the near future, there has been a large
increase in the quantity and variety of
materials available to prospective builders.
I think the possibility we have to consider
is that a year from now there may still be
a rental problem in some areas of the country,
but not in most, and that in these circumstances it would be wise for the federal
parliament to abandon the general regulation
of rents and leave it to the provincial legislatures to impose controls in ariy local areas
where they are deemed necessary.
The motion was. agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the third reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
FISHERIES PRICES SUPPORT BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 54, an Act to amend
the Fisheries Prices Support Act, 1944.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have asked the honourable gentleman from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) to move
the second reading and to explain the bill.

Hon. G. P. Burchill moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
similar to the measure which we considered
yesterday afternoon, the Agricultural Prices
Support Bill. The original Act was passed in
1944 and, with the exception of section 9,
came into force on royal assent. Section 9,
which empowers Fisheries Prices Support
Board, subject to regulations of the Governor
in Council, to prescribe prices and purchase
fisheries products, was not to come into force
except on proclamation of the Governor in
Council. Pursuant to provisions of section
12 of the Act a proclamation was issued
bringing section 9 into force on July 23, 1947.
This proclamation did not specify the period
during which section 9 would remain in force.
Section 12 is now being repealed. This will
have the effect of placing section 9 on a continuing basis. In other words, this section,
like the other sections of the Act, could only
be put to an end by parliament.
Honourable senators might like to hear a
short resume of what has been accomplished
by the Fisheries Prices Support Board. Originally it consisted of five members, and after
confederation with Newfoundland one more
was added, to represent that province. Two
members, one each from the East and West
coasts, represent the processing industry; two
other members represent fishermen's co-operatives, one on the West and one on the East
coast. The chairman is a permanent departmental official.
Since its organization the board has made
two purchases. In 1948 it purchased a quantity of canned fish, and the house might find
the circumstances of interest. These canned
fish were herring, mackerel and cod, all from
the East coast. No purchases have been made
from the West coast.
The canried fish industry on the East coast
had expanded during the war from a production of 50,000 cases to 500,000. There was a
ready market for all this fish up to the end
of 1947, when the entire production was purchased by UNRRA. In 1948, however,
the market for this class of goods disappeared,
and the fishermen were left with a big stock
on hand and no prospect of disposal. In
these circumstances the board thought it was
justified in taking action, and it purchased
50 per cent of the quantity that had been
bought in the previous year by UNRRA. The
prices paid by the board were 90 per cent
of the previous year's figures. Purchases
were allocated among the canners in proportion to the quantities that they had supplied
to UNRRA in the preceding year, and 151,000
cases were delivered. A large part of this
fish was shipped to Middle East relief, and

SENATE
about 45,000 cases were given to hospitals
and
charitable
institutions
in
Canada.
Some 10,000 cases were sold-3,000 to commercial exporters, at cost price, and 7,000 to

transaction shows a loss of $603,000.
The other purchase was made from the
lake fishermen of Manitoba. In the spring
of 1949, largely because of the deep snow on
the ground, these fishermen were unable to
make deliveries to their normal market, which
is in the northern part of the Central United
States, and they had left on their hands 5
million pounds of frozen fish, chiefly white
fish, sauger, pike, pickerel, trout and tullibee,
which the dealers in Winnipeg refused to
purchase. The board fixed a price at 80 per
cent of the current market price, and took
delivery of approximately 3,400,000 pounds
at a total cost of $281,740. Of this amount
$48,000 was realized, leaving a loss of
$264,000. The total net loss on the purchase of
fish products by the board up to date is
$867,000.
I might add that I have been informed that
m-my insistent demands have been made by
the flsh industry in other sections of the
country for relief and for support, all of
which have been denied by the Fisheries
Board, as they felt that the circumstances in
each case did not justify their taking action.
I believe that the explanation I have made
pretty well covers the legislation; but if honourable members wish to have the bill go
to committee for further information, the
officials of the department and of the board
will be only too happy to provide any further
details which members may require.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is it to be the policy of the
board in future, after their experience with
former purchases of canned fish, not to buy
any more canned fish?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: To judge from conversations I have had with members of the board,
I think it would be going a little too far to
say that they have come to that decision, but
I have the very strong impression that every
demand of this sort will be scrutinized most
carefully, and that no purchase will be made
unless the members of the board are absolutely sure that no other course is open to
them.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: In case of emergency they
would take similar action.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Now, unless any honourable senator wishes to send it to committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

SECTION-MOTION

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, with leave of the Senate, I move:
That the Senate do unite with the House of Commens in the appointment of a Joint Committee of
both Houses of Parliament ta examine and study
the operation and effects of existing legislation of
the Parliament of Canada and of the several provincial legislatures with respect ta old age security;
similar legislation in other countries, possible alternative measures of old age security for Canada,

Fallis, Farquhar, Ferland, Horner, Hurtubise, King,
Leger, Moraud, Stevenson and Vaillancourt.
That the committee have power ta appoint, from
among its members, such subcommittees as may be

ordered. by the committee for the use of the committee and of parliament, and that Rule 100 of the
Senate be suspended in relation thereto.
That a message be sent ta the flouse of Commons
ta inform that house accordingly.

He said: Honourable senators, before
appointments from this house are ma-de to
this joint committee, I wish to point out that
the subject to be considered, although not
new, is of vital importance to the general
public of Canada, and that when appropriate
action is taken it will undoubtedly have a
great effect on the economy of Canada.
Wi'th the rapid advance that is being made
by leading industries in the way of providing
pension rights for their employees, the people
of Canada, on the question of pensions, are
being divided into two classes. In one group
are those who are fortunate enough to have
an employer who offers a pension system,
whether contributory or otherwise, from
which his employees may expect tô receive
benefits in their old age, and in the other
group-and no doubt it includes by far the
largest part of the population-are those who
undertake by their own efforts, or should
undertake, to provide for their old age. The
unhappy position in which the members of
the second class find themselves is this: that
while attempting unaided to provide for their
own old age they, as consumers of goods and
services, are helping to maintain most of the
old age pension plans from which others
benefit. Though I have no particular knowledge on the subject, I would say, that the
contributions made by the employers over a
period of time are equal to or greater than

those made by the individual contributors.
whether the
Make no mistake about it:
organization is a government institution or
one of our industrial, commercial or financial
enterprises, the contributions needed to
supplement payments by individuals do not
come out of the air; they are derived from
the public generally, either through taxation
or the enhanced cost of goods and services.
It follows that those who are attempting to
provide independently for their future must
bear not only the cost of their own protection
but make a contribution to the pensions of

SENATE
those who, I suggest, are in the more favoured class. Obviously that condition cannot
be prolonged indefinitely.
More and more, as time goes by, progressive
industrial and commercial businesses are
engaging themselves to provide for their
employees through some type of old age pension scheme. The more widely this trend
develops, the more the people at large will
have to contribute in some form or other.
Consequently, while admitting the value of
schemes which protect 'those who can pay for
them, and others sponsored by large employers of labour, public and private, it is
important that some provision be made to
enable those outside these favoured circles
to obtain the like advantages.
Any such system, if national in scope and
open to everyone, will involve a very great
financial outlay, and the people of Canada
must be prepared to undertake the provision
for this purpose of large sums year after year.
But, on the other side of the account, I should
point out that those who reap these benefits
will inevitably proceed to spend the money,
and the stabilizing effect upon 'the economy
of the country should be very considerable.
One of the most important tasks of the projected committee is to approach the subject
in a realistic manner, with a view to determining how the desired end can be attained
without unduly weakening the economy of the
country. It should ensure that as far as
possible everybody concerned does what he
should do, and provides his due share; because
there can be no doubt as to the wisdom of
any individual during his earning days laying aside something for his old age. The
only problem is one of method, and that is
primarily for the committee.
For my part, I have always felt that if a
scheme is worked out after sober consideration and with careful attention to detail, it
should not have a serious adverse effect upon
our national economy. I take it as a matter
of course that existing plans must be integrated to whatever national plan is adopted;
and those who today are not participating
upon a contributory basis in one or other of
the various pension plans are, I take it, or
should be, laying aside voluntarily an amount
equal to the average of their neighbours' contributions, with a view to accumulating sufficient on which to retire. Mind you, the 5 per
cent which is the usual contribution by the
employee under existing pension plans is in
most cases supplemented by an equal or
greater contribution from the employer.
Therefore if an individual hopes ,to have an
adequate retirement fund of his own, he
should be setting aside something equivalent
to these contributions.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: There are many noncontributory schemes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill)
says there are many non-contributory
schemes. That means, of course, that the
employer pays the whole cost of the retirement pension out of the goodness of his heart.
But one thing is sure, and that is that this
burden is reflected in the salary of the
employees. I know of one utility corporation which is meeting the total cost of its
employees' old age pensions, but the wage
level of the employees indicates that they are,
in effect, carrying their share of the cost of
the retirement fund. This must necessarily
be so. For instance, if a person receives a
salary of $3,000 of which he contributes 5 per
cent to an old age pension scheme which is
supplemented by his employer, that is tantamount to a salary of $2,500 or $2,850 where
the employer bears the whole cost of the
pension. Broad and long it is generally
recognized that the contributory basis is the
most workable plan.
I would point out to the members of the
committee that they have a great responsibility, but I am sure that other honourable
senators feel that it will be capably discharged. This problem will have far-reaching effects, and the only persons who cannot
possibly be interested in it are those who
believe they will never grow old. Unless
some pension scheme is put into effect, it is
inevitable that our people will face a time
when they have nothing on which to retire,
and this will result in a serious problem. I
have every confidence that our committee will
enter upon their task with a full realization
of its importance, and will address to it their
very best efforts.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to say anything about the
work of the committee. I have every confidence that the members of the committee
have the ability and experience to render an
able judgment to this house and to
parliament.
This is probably the most difficult subject
that any committee of this house bas attacked
since I have had the honour of sitting in this
chamber. I read the Hansard report of this
debate in another place, and I noticed that
two or three of the members there took very
much the line that has been taken by my
honourable friend the leader of the government, when he said that the pension schemes
of the federal, provincial and municipal governments and of industrial concerns will have
to be properly co-ordinated. I agree with
that.

MARCH 31,1950
I might refer to one point which my
honourable friend did not mention. People
employed by small companies which have no
retirement plan at all, or at any rate, not a
very generous one, are constantly being
attracted to federal, provincial or municipal
services, because of the old age security
provided by governments. Small concerns are
unable 'to meet this competition, and daily
they are losing members of their staffs, every
one of whom has undergone some period
of training at the employer's expense and
has become more or less efficient. In every
such case an employee's resignation means
some loss in the company's efficiency, which
requires time to make good. I am persuaded
that if there was a pension scheme right
across the board, this pulling away of
employees from small industries would cease.
The joint committee will, I think, do a
very fine work. To the Senate section of
the committee I wish to make one suggestion.
Yesterday when the appointment of the committee was under consideration in another
place, some honourable -members there
expressed their views on pensions-to the
effect that the amount payable should be $60
a month, that everybody should be eligible
on reaching the age of sixty, and so on. I have
no intention of going into that kind of
thing at all, for it will be the committee's
duty to investigate the facts and base its
report upon them. But, in all humility, I
would point out to the members of the
Senate section that they will be the representatives of this chamber on the joint
committee, and I suggest that they should
always remember that their responsibility is
heavier than that of the members of the
Hou'se of Commons section. The members
of that house, being elected by the people,
are bound to feel the pressure of public
opinion in their respective constituencies, and
may make some recommendations thsat it
would be impossible for parliament to carry
out. But the sole purpose of the group
from this chamber should be to give their
best consideration to the facts. We members
of the Senate are the highest class of pensioners in Canada. I say that with every
desire to be fair. No other people in the
country are in the same position as we
are, and on that account the burden on us
is very much heavier. If we do not bring
in a proper report on the facts, our action
will be very severely criticized by the
public.
I am one of those who congratulate the
government upon having proposed the establishment of this committee, for the subject
of old-age pensions is too big to be determined on political considerations. If, in

dealing with the problem, we were to go
off on the wrong tangent, we might wreck
the economic stability of our country. That
is another point which the twelve members of the Senate section must keep in
mind.
I am hopeful that the committee's report
will be made before the present parliament
ends, so that the people will be given an
opportunity to express their opinions upon
it. My further hope is that the recommend'ations which the committee may make will
receive public endorsement.
I have very much pleasure in joining the
leader of the government in supporting this
resolution.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I first wish to commend the government for
taking the initiative in recommending the
appointment of a committe on old age
security. There are many more problems
related to this subject than most people
realize. I say that because the government
has been criticized by certain groups who
are telling poor people that the setting up
of a committee is the only action that will
be taken by the government in this matter.
We are all concerned in the welfare of our
fellow citizens, and no one can say that
his concern for the public is greater than
that of anyone else. If the committee's
recommendations result in taking the question of old age pensions out of politics a great
advance will have been made, because ever
since the present scheme was put into effect
it has been the political football of various
parties, some of whom have sought to gain
votes by promising that if elected they would
see to it that the amount of the pension was
increased.
I would point out to the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that while in Canada,
as elsewhere, there are of course some elderly
people whose lack of means is the result of
their own improvidence, the important fact
to bear in mind is that large numbers of
honest and worthy citizens have raised families and worked hard throughout their lives,
but for reasons beyond their control have
been unable to lay by enough to take care of
themselves in old age. They have given the
best of their lives to the building up of this
country, but perhaps because of sickness and
relatively small incomes, or for other good
reasons, it has been impossible for them to
maké themselves independent.
The leader of the opposition said that we
senators are the most highly-pensioned group
in the country. Well, before I was appointed
to this chamber I said that it provided the
most striking example of what social security
can do for human beings. British Columbia

SENATE

discovered through investigation of the aged
people in that province that since the establishment of old age pensions the average life
of its citizens had increased by almost two
years. Now, surely it is worth giving serious
'hought to any scheme which, by removing
from people's minds and, hearts the fear of
becoming destitute-and it is a very real
fear-results in the lengthening of life.
As I have not had the honour to be appointed to the committee, which is one of
the most important that parliament has set
up, may I respectfully suggest that some consideration be given to the scheme of old age
pensions in Britain, where people of sixtyfive and seventy are encouraged to keep on
rendering some service. I have long been
of the view that labour in this and other
countries has not taken the wisest course in
advocating and procuring the compulsory
retirement of people at sixty-five. I have
previously expressed my strong belief, and
I would like to repeat it, that the majority
of people who are pensioned at sixty-five,
and have nothing to keep them busy, do not
live longer than five more years. Even though
a person can retire at sixty-five with enough
income to provide for his food, clothing and
shelter, if you force him to retire at that age
and leave him without any occupation at all,
you in effect pronounce the death sentence
upon him. I should like to see encouragement given to those people who are able to
continue rendering service after sixty-five.
I should like to sec encouragement to continue in service given to those who are able
to do so but are beyond a prescribed age. We
must remember that the cost of financing an
old age pension plan has to be paid for by
what individuals produce. With shorter working hours and retirement at sixty, I am wondering if the country will be able to carry
the cost of any very extensive scheme of
pensions.
It may interest some honourable senators to
know that last year some unions were advocating retirement at a much earlier age than
sixty-five. A lobby went around the House
of Commons proposing fifty-five years as the
age of a retirement and a pension of $100 per
month-a suggestion which caused me to ask
somewhat sarcastically: Why not make it
forty years instead of fifty-five? The trend is
towards producing less and receiving more.
My principal reason for rising to take part
in this discussion was to commend the government on its action and to reiterate what has
already been said, that this is a most important committee.
Another matter which must be considered
is the extent of the benefits to be paid te
superannuated people. Just last week a man

who came to see me said that for twentyfive years he had paid into a retirement fund,
and that now he was getting an allowance
of $65 a month; whereas his neighbour, who
had not contributed directly to the exchequer
or to a retirement fund, was getting $100 a
month. He wanted to know why the distinction. I believe that to a considerable extent
we have penalized thrift.
I do not wish to say more than to express
my best wishes to the joint committee. I
trust that when a report is brought in it will
mark a forward step in removing the means
test and taking this whole question out of the
realm of politics, sometimes very cheap
politics.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Honourable senators, as a
member from the tenth province of Canada
I wish to protest against being put in the
category of the highest class of pensioners in
Canada. I do not think it was a proper
reference for the honourable leader opposite
to make, and I should like to hear what he
bas to say about it.
Hon.

Norman

P.

Lambert:

Honourable

senators, we are now concerned with the passing of a resolution to set up the Senate section of a joint committee to investigate the
question of old age pensions. I have no
desire to pre-judge the case, neither do I wish
to say anything which might be interpreted
as a suggestion to the representatives of this
chamber on that committee. I rise at the
moment as a result of the off-hand characterization of this body by my friend the leader
opposite, te the effect that it is composed of
the highest class of pensioners in Canada.
I wish to take exception to this characterization on various counts. First, I do not
think that in approaching this question bonourable senators should give any consideration to the annual indemnities which they
receive.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: As a matter of fact, I
know of nothing that will be capitalized on
more sensationally by a certain element of the
press in this country than the observation
made by my honourable friend. I know that
he never thought of it in that way.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, I did.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I have been observing
such matters for a long time now, and I
know what the results will be.
The second aspect of the question is this.
When persons decide to run as candidates for
the House of Commons-eventually, perhaps,
to be appointed to this chamber-they
approach the prospect; from a wholesome
point of view and with a desire to sectire for

MARCH 31, 1950
the people some of the benefits that they
themselves have enjoyed as a result of their
citizenship in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I believe that that is the
paramount desire. in the minds of most people
who choose public life as a career, and I do
not think it can be expressed in terrns of old
age pensions. We are greatly privileged if,
through our attention to this matter of pensions, we can be of any use to the community
which is responsible for our being here.
I may remind honourable senators, that in
1925, as a result of the position taken by this
body, with respect to a certain bill, the question of old age pensions was fpr the time
being rejected. This in turn gave rise to
another issue, namely, the reform of the
Senate. True, very little has been heard about
this incident in the years since, and I merely
refer to it now to show the historical association of the Senate with the old age pensions
issue. It has a very direct bearing upon the
point of view of the Senate in such matters
when eventually it comes to decide on this
subject in the year 1950. The position taken
in 1925 was due, I think, to a feeling of partisanship before a general election. I hope the
Senate will not now do anything in that spirit.
This joint committee will be set up to consider all the aspects of a very involved and
difficult problem. I believe that the basic
consideration must be the economie and financial capacity of this country to bear the cost
of whatever system is recommended. That is
the guiding principle that should be followed
by the members of this committee.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, this is not the time to debate the subject
before us, but I wish to take enough time to
express my vital interest in it. I trust that the
committee will succeed in its endeavours, and
will bring in a wise and human report.
I should like now to come to the defence
of my friend the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig). I think he has run the risk of indulging
in the most dangerous form of argument, that
of analogy. When one says that a certain matter is analogous to something else he has in
mind certain points of similarity, but he is running the risk of being misunderstood on other
points as to which similarities do not exist. I
think the honourable gentleman made an
error when he said we were the highest paid
old age pensioners.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say "old age".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, "pensioners",
then. I suppose what he had in mind was
that we of this Senate enjoy a certain security; that we are not worried about the cost
of bread and butter, and coal for the stove,

and so are in the position to give our best
thought to subjects in which we are not especially personally interested, and to devote our
time to public affairs. I believe, and I hope,
that that was his meaning; because I do notand I know he does not-look upon the members of this body as pensioners, but rather
as hired men engaged by the public in their
service. Let us not get away from that
thought. We are not pensioners: we are not
drawing anything for nothing. At least I do
not feel that I am. I believe I am giving
service for every dollar I receive, and if I
thought otherwise I would resign and leave
the job for somebody else who could do it.
We are hired men, not pensioners, and we
are giving, I hope and believe, the equivalent
in service of everything we receive. But let
us go a little further if we can give $2 worth
for every dollar we receive.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Will the honourable senator permit a question? By the use of the
simile "hired men" is he not transgressing
the very rule he set up for the conduct of
the leader of the opposition?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps I, too, fell into
that error. Our position is not quite analogous to that of a hired man, but the simile
is, I think, a much better one than that used
by the leader of the opposition. I do not
think we need pursue it further: I rather
fancy that I have expressed the thought that
was in the mind of the honourable gentleman
when he spoke.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I interject on behalf
of the leader of the opposition that I am
convinced that he is one of those in this
chamber who earns twice as much as the
indemnity he receives.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: The subject of old age
pensions is one which always engages our
sympathies. Like most welfare projects, it
makes an appeal to the heart more than to
the head. And that is not a bad thing,
because there is pretty high authority for the
statement that out of the heart are the issues
of life.
I do not propose today to offer any suggestions to the representatives from this
house who will sit upon the committee. The
subject matter of the question before us is
one which cannot be considered apart from
the general financial situation of the country;
indeed, it was made clear that that was the
main reason for setting up the committee.
Much has been said in the press, by certain
public men and by varlous organizations,
about old age pensions. It has been argued
that they should be payable at a much earlier
age than they are at the present time; that

SENATE
they should be contributory; that they should
not be contributory; that there should be no
means test. As I understand the terms of the
motion, it is proposed that the committee
which is being set up will examine into all
these matters and, if possible, reach some
sound conclusion. But it appears to me that
we must beware lest we defeat the generous
purpose which has inspired all the projects of
social security that have been undertaken not
only by the federal government but by provincial governments and many municipalities.
For let us not deceive ourselves; expenditures
of this character are not confined wholly to
the dominion treasury. Most of the provinces
carry in their provincial budgets large items
for precisely this object. At times the doubt
rises in my mind whether there is not a
danger of so burdening with expenditures
the productive capacity of this country that
neither the national nor the provincial governments nor the municipalities will be able
to support the budgets which are placed
before their constituents.
Taxation is at a very high level. It would
be interesting to ascertain, as I think could
be done with approximate accuracy, how
much by way of taxes a man who earns, say,
$2,000 a year, and has five children, is paying to our various governing bodies. The
popular notion is that he is exempt from taxation because the exemption from income tax
of married people now includes those in
receipt of $2,000 a year. But taxes on income
form only a small part of what people pay
by way of taxation. Take cigarettes as an
illustration. From statistics as to the quantity used in this country, it is quite obvious
that most of them are consumed by people
whose incomes are not over $2,000 a year.
Yet I am told that every 35-cent package of
cigarettesHon. Mr. Farris: Thirty-six cents.
to the federal
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -pays
treasury a tax of about twenty-two cents. That
is an impost of which people know little or
nothing. But I am sure this committee will
have in mind the total weight of taxation
upon the Canadian people when they address
themselves to consideration of the problem of
old age pensions, and whether such pensions
should be contributory, and what other factors enter into the matter.
May I express regret that my honourable
friend the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) alluded to the members of this house
as being the highest class of pensioners in
Canada. I agree with the honourable member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) that that
remark will probably make headlines
tomorrow. I do not look upon our position

in that way. When the framers of our constitution devised the instrument under which
we are governed they provided expressly for
a second chamber-for a Senate-and it is
not too much to say that if they had not been
able to agree upon the creation of a second
chamber and how it should be constituted,
been
would never have
confederation
achieved. This is an historical fact, and in
those circumstances we are not a group of
hirelings or pensioners; we form a body of
men provided for under our constitution, and
as such we have a responsible duty to discharge to our country. This being so I for
one refuse to look upon myself in this
chamber as a pensioner or a hired man. If
I looked upon myself as being in that category, I honestly say that my self respect
would not permit me to sit in my chair five
minutes longer.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I hope that too much
notice will not be taken of the remark of
my honourable friend the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig), because I know he is as
much concerned as anyone here in maintaining the position and standard of the Senate.
My honourable friend has made a most useful contribution to the work of this chamber
in the past, and I am sure he will continue
to do so in the future. I feel that upon further reflection both he and my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), whom I also hold in the highest
regard, will come to the conclusion that perhaps they spoke a little ill-advisedly.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
know that I have not the right to speak to
this subject again at this time, but would the
house permit me a word?
Some Hon. Senators: Proceed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: First I should like to thank
the honourable member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), the honourable
member from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) and
the honourable member from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) for their remarks. I want to
say quite candidly that I meant no insult to
anybody. I fully appreciate the work done
by the Senate, I have always tried to do my
share, but when we make our report on this
important subject I do not want any outsider
to say that we forgot our own positions. Perhaps this attitude may not be understandable
to some, but there is no denying the fact
that I was not elected to this chamber, I was
appointed by the government of the day.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As provided for under the
constitution.

MARCH 31, 1950
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that, but what I
want to stress is that the Senate members on
this joint committee are faced with a most
difficult role. The members on the committee from another place are not in the same
position, because they were elected by the
people and can take the consequences.
If honourable members think I have made
a mistake, I shall accept their judgment, but
I do not want any man or woman outside this
chamber to call attention to the fact that
I have an annuity for life which I did not
earn. It is true that I give service for it now;
but I do not care what anybody says, the fact
is that I did not earn it, I was presented with
it-and I have never heard of more than one
or two senators resigning. I agree with my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity that
it is rather difficult to make comparisons, but
I want to say that when I have come to my
judgment as the result of the work of this
committee I shall have done so knowing the
difficulty of my position.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would my honourable
friend substitute the word responsibility for
the word difficulty? If he did, I think he
would be right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I will use that wordthe responsibility of my position. I do not
want somebody outside of the house to say
what I am saying now in this house,
Hon. Mr. Farris: They will.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps they will, but I
shall have said it first. I have been in politics long enough to know that you silence the
fire of the opposition if you beat him to the
gun. What I am trying to make clear is that
I do not want somebody to say: "Well, Haig,
you voted against pensions, but what stipend
do you draw? Is it all earned, or is it purely
a pension?" If they say that to me I shall be
able to tell them that I admitted it from the
start, and that nevertheless my judgment
was the best I could give.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Churchill about the difficulties involved in
this matter; and I want to stress the fact that
the twelve senators appointed to this committee have a tremendous burden to carry,
and that I shall do everything I can to help
them.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo: Honourable senators,
I have no intention of detaining the house
at any length, but I should like to express
my support of the appointment of this important committee.
While it may be presumptuous on my part
to give some advice to the members who are
about to serve on this committee, to do so

would seem to be in line with what has
already been done. I should like to draw the
attention of the house to the awkward situation which exists at this particular timethe spring of 1950-when so many pension
proposals are being presented across the
country. The impact of these proposals in
relation to the present government pensionplan is creating this situation, so I suggest
that the inter-relation of government schemes
and industrial schemes is something to which
the committee ought to direct particular
attention.
The motion was agreed to.

THE SENATE
NEWSPAPER COVERAGE

On the orders of the day:
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are

SENATE
proceeded with I should like, with leave of
the Senate, to answer a question that was
directed to me some days ago by the honourable senator from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis),
and to which, for one reason or another, I
have not previously had an opportunity to
reply.
The honourable gentleman asked me if
I was satisfied with the newspaper coverage
Speaking for
of the Senate's activities.
myself, and for myself alone, I may say that
I have always been more concerned about
having the Senate do what it should do, and
doing that well, than about whether it "made"
the headlines in the press.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Though our work is
necessary, much of it is tedious and unspectacular. A former distinguished member of
this house once said, "The Senate should be
a works'hop, not a theatre." If matters of
news interest are dealt with in the course of
our activities, the press will be keen to note
and publish the facts, as developments of
recent weeks have clearly demonstrated. Our
major concern should be to do what we should
do; and what we do, we should do well.
I have not the slightest doubt that, in due
course, changes may be made in our constitution. For example, consideration may be
given to a compulsory retiring age for future
appointees to the Senate as well as to the
Superior Courts of the provinces. This and
possibly other proposals may well be considered by the responsible authorities, but it
is my considered opinion that the Senate of
Canada will, in some form, continue indefinitely to be a part of our parliamentary
institutions.
The Senate was originally constituted for
the express purpose of protecting racial,
religious and geographical minorities in the
country against the possible action of a transient majority in the House of Commons. It
is a tribute to the good sense and the spirit
of fairness which have characterized all governments since confederation that it has not
been necessary for the Senate to exercise its
power and assume its responsibility in this
respect in a single instance. However, I am
convinced that, should the occasion arise, any
attempt on the part of any government to
encroach on the rights of the minorities in
Canada would be fiercely resisted in this
chamber. Though anyone familiar with the
political history of Canada would know that
this function was one of the primary
reasons for the creation of the Senate, there
has been over past years a certain body of
opinion that the Senate was unnecessary for
the protection of these rights, because of the

fact that a Canadian constitutional amendment affecting minorities would be adequately
scrutinized by the Imperial Parliament.
Whether or not this assumption was right is
open to question, but since the power to
amend the Caniadian constitution is in process
of being given to Canada, the agitation for
abolition of the Senate is disappearing. I
believe it would be a very small minority in
Canada which would advocate that future
amendments to the Canadian constitution
should be left entirely to a one-chamber parliament. I think we can conclude, therefore,
that whatever form it may take in the future,
a second chamber will remain a permanent
part of the Canadian parliament.
If this be the case-and I believe it isthe question that next arises is what the
Senate does, and in what way it could do
more. In addition to standing, and continuing to stand, as a bulwark .against anything
that would adversely affect the rights of
minorities, there are at least four other distinct types of service which I believe the
Senate can render as part of the Parliament
of Canada.
The first is the detailed consideration of
all legislation that is placed before it, whether
introduced in the Senate in the first instance
or coming from the House of Commons. This
work we have always done and, I believe,
done well; and I should hope we would
continue to do it well. As our consideration
of legislation in detail largely takes place
before our standing committees rather than
in Committee of the Whole, it does not
attract as much publicity as it would if the
reverse were the case. But because our consideration of legislation in this way is not
widely publicized by the newspapers, this
does not mean that our work is not done
Under our present practice,
effectively.
most of the legislation is referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. The care and effectiveness which
have characterized the deliberations of that
comrmittee in considering legislation have
been highly commended, from time to time,
by those qualified to judge its work. I do not
hesitate to say that the detailed consideration
of legislation in the Senate of Canada,
through its standing committees, is equal to
that given to legislation in any other legislative body. Whether or not the newspapers
appreciate it-and say so-is another matter
entirely.
The second responsibility which is ours
and has been ours for a long period of time
is, under present practice, the work of the
Divorce Committee. Because there are no
divorce courts in Quebec and Newfoundland,
persons in those provinces who seek divorce

MARCH 31 1950
do so through the medium of parliament,
and the responsibility is on the Senate to
set up a committee to hear all the applications and make findings on thç evidence.
This is tedious work. It is unspectacular
work. The work is not reported in the
newspapers, but it bas been done well and
thoroughly in the past and, I believe, will
continue to be done that way as long as
the responsibility rests on our shoulders. On
the Senate committee charged with this
responsibility there are laymen of sound
judgment and some of the ablest legal minds
in Canada. I do not believe it is possible
to improve on the standard of work which
is done by the Senate through the medium
of its Divorce Committee.
The Senate's third responsibility is the consideration of governmental expenditures. Not
a dollar can be legally voted, nor can any
tax be imposed by parliament, without the
consent of the Senate. There bas always
been some investigation by the Senate of
government expenditures. I am bound to
admit, however, that it has been far from
sufficient. The reasons for our shortcomings
in this respect have been varied, and have
been due partly to the fact that in the past
the estimates were not tabled in parliament
as early in the session as they have been
this year. I need' hardly remind this house
that this session we have moved to give
more detailed consideration to governmental
expenditures than we have given to them
in other years.
We have in this house men of considerable
business, professional and political experience, who are able and anxious to study ways
and means of increasing the efficiency of the
public service, and who carefully scrutinize
expenditures with a view to pointing out
possible economies in the cost of administration. Public funds should be expended in
such a way as to insure that adequate value
is received in return for the money which is
provided by the taxpayers. The amount of
money spent by our government today is
so large that it is impossible for one bouse
of parliament to fully examine the details of
expenditures. There is sufficient work of
this nature to occupy the time of both
houses. Probably the most useful work the
Senate can do in this connection is to study
the expenditures with a view to recommending to the government methods of
effecting economies.
The fourth activity which I would suggest
to the house is that during each session of
parliament we undertake at least one inquiry
by a special comrmittee into some major
problem that confronts the Canadian people.
In the past we have inquired into the Income
55950-15

Tax Act and the problem of immigration, and
currently we have before us the subject of
human rights and fundamental freedoms. I
need not say to the bouse that when the time
is opportune we should embark on an extensive inquiry into the future position of
Canada's international trade, or any problem
of a like nature, a thorough investigation of
which might be of benefit to the people of
Canada. Many members of the house have
advocated such inquiries.
I am not suggesting that the activities to
which I have referred exhaust the possible
services which the Senate could render in
the parliamentary life of Canada. I am convinced, however, that in carrying on these
activities we will have the personal satisfaction of knowing that we are discharging our
responsibilities well, and that there will be
an ever-increasing appreciation of this fact
on the part of the public of Canada generally.

with that view that I now rise on a question
of privilege.

on false pretences. Speaking of myself, it

And the editorial concludes with these words:
On second thought perhaps the senator ought to
try again. Perhaps the Senate ought to be reformed.

If the matter had been left at that I would
not have replied, because it bas always been
my line of conduct in public life never to pay
attention to newspaper reports. But on March
28 the Toronto Daily Star published an editorial on my remarks. What surprises me
most, honourable senators, is that the Star
should get it3 information from the Globe

THE LATE SENATOR LEGER
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I regret to have to say that since
we last met we have lost one of our most
esteemed and distinguished colleagues, the
Honourable Antoine J. Leger, LL.D., K.C.,
who died on April 7, 1950.
Senator Leger was born October 16, 1880
at Memramcook, New Brunswick. He was
the son of Julien T. Leger and his wife, the
former Marie LeBlanc, both French Acadians.
Educated in the common schools of New
Brunswick, he attended St. Joseph's University, where he received the degrees of
B.A. and M.A. The university later honoured
him with the degree of Doctor of Laws.
Senator Leger was called to the bar of
New Brunswick in 1907, and was created a
K.C. in 1932. He carried on an extensive
law practice in Moncton as the senior partner
of the law firm of Leger & Leger.
In addition to this, his activities touched
almost all aspects of the community in which
he lived. He was a director of the Moncton
Broadcasting Company Limited; solicitor for
the Provincial Bank of Canada; a member
of the advisory committee of the Eastern
Trust Company, Moncton Branch; legal
adviser of La Société L'Assomption and a
member of the Board of Trade. He was also
a trustee of the Moncton School Board and
President of the Grand Pré Memorial Church
Committee. As a member of the Royal
Society of Canada, Senator Leger was keenly
interested in the culture of this country, and
was the author of three notable works:
"L'histoire de la Société L'Assomption," "Elle
et lui" and "Une Fleur d'Acadie." In 1925 he
was elected to the New Brunswick legislature
and was made Provincial Secretary-Treasurer
in the same year. He was re-elected in 1930
and served in the cabinet until 1935, when
he was summoned to this chamber. In 1947
he was appointed a parliamentary adviser to
the second session of the General Assembly
of the United Nations, held in New York.
In the passing of Senator Leger this house
has lost one of its most experienced, useful
and conscientious members. He liad enjoyed
a long and varied experience in law, business,
finance and public affairs. His membership
55950-15&

in the Royal Society of Canada and his activities as an author bore witness to his great
interest in culture, particularly that of.the
Acadians, of whom he was such a distinguished representative. He combined with,
his wide knowledge an industry and application in the discharge of his responsibilitiesthat made him an outstanding figure in the
senate of Canada and, indeed, in any assembly of which he was a member. His kindly
manner, his wide knowledge and great industry gained for him the affection and respect'
of his colleagues in this house.
Senator Leger is survived by his wife, the
former Marie Bourgeois; one daughter, Mrs,
Leo LeBlanc; and four sons, the Reverend
Camille Leger, Charles Edouard and Francis
Leger, Moncton barristers, and Dr. Emery
Leger.
To his widow and family I extend our
sincerest sympathy in their great bereavement.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, it
is with a heavy heart that I rise tonight to
speak of the passing of Senator Leger. He
and I had the honour of being appointed to
this chamber on the same day, and the longer
I knew him the better I liked him. It seems
that when one lacks a certain quality one
deeply admires it in a friend, and Senator
Leger possessed many qualities that I have
lacked. Whenever I had occasion to ask him
to read over an amendment to a statute he
would soon present me with a brief fully
explaining the amendment and what effect
it would have if adopted.
Senator Leger was a cheerful person whose
word was as good as his bond. He brought
honour to the Acadian people, to New Bruns-,
wick, to the Senate of Canada and to
Canadians as a whole. Such men are hard to
replace, and whenever he spoke I turned
around to listen, for I knew that his words
would be to the enlightenment of all honourable senators.
I always felt that Senator Leger would outlive those who were appointed to the Senate
with him in 1935; but here tonight we are
recording his passing. I am sure that I convey
the feelings of honourable members of this
house when I say to his widow and children
that they may well be proud of a husband
and father who gave such distinguished
service to the country of his birth. We in this
part of the chamber have very heavy hearts
over the passing of Antoine Leger; we know
it will be many a day before New Brunswick
is represented here by a more distinguished
man. One of the most distressing things
about being a senator is that you get to know
and love the men around you-you know in
your heart that you love them, though you
do not tell them so-and inevitably the time

upon him. Both honourable leaders of
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
house have paid tribute to his graciousness
and to the services he has rendered to his second reading of Bill J-4, an Act to amend
country. As I have said before, I did not know the Aeronautics Act.

APRIL 24, 1950
He said: This bill is designed to clarify a
number of points which have arisen in connection with the exercise of federal government authority in the field of civil aviation.
The Aeronautics Act was approved by parliament shortly after the First World War,
and at that time accorded to the government
and the responsible minister broad powers
over the development of civil aviation. These
powers related primarily to technical matters,
such as airports and airways, certification of
airworthiness and of pilots, safety regulation
and other similar matters. The regulation of
civil aviation was, in the first instance,
included within the general framework of
military control, but in the 1930's it was
transferred to a separate minister.
In view of the increasing importance of
commercial aviation in Canada and its
expected expansion after the war, in 1944 a
new section was added to the Act which provided for the licensing of commercial air services and for their general economic regulation by the Air Transport Board, under the
supervision of the minister. This new section
became Part II of the Act, and the older
framework, which related primarily to
technical control, became Part I.
The rapid growth of commercial aviation in
Canada since the war and the reasonably
satisfactory economic position that it has
achieved since that time, with a several-fold
multiplication of the total amount of business
done, provide evidence that the legislation
was generally satisfactory and that the policies pursued within its limits were sound.
The amendments in this bill are not
intended to provide for any major change in
policy or substantial extension of authority
over civil aviation. Rather, they are changes
which have become necessary as a result of
experience in administration of the Act over
recent years. They are designed to correct
certain anomalies in the Act, to clarify the
intent of certain sections and clauses upon
which some doubt has arisen in practical interpretation, and to avoid any confusion or overlapping in responsibility. This will make it
possible for the Air Transport Board and the
Department of Transport, (Air), to deal with
civil aviation in a flexible fashion, and to
keep pace with the frequent changes which
are taking place in this relatively new field.
Without going into the detail of the individual changes proposed, a brief statement on
some of the major points involved will indicate the intent and nature of the amendments
proposed.
Some changes are designed to avoid confusion between Part I, which deals primarily
with technical regulation, and Part II, which
deals primarily with economic regulation. In

addition, minor changes are introduced to
clarify the relationship between civil aviation
and the defence field, and to eliminate provisions which relate to military requirements,
which are now provided for elsewhere.
Further, the economic regulation of carriers applies to all commercial air services
which have been defined as services for hire
In view of the arguments
or reward.
advanced in certain legal proceedings under
the Act, there is much confusion as to the
exact meaning of this phrase. The argument
advanced was that a commercial operation
which is not designed for profit, or a commercial operation which does not show a
profit, cannot be classed as an operation
"for hire or reward". A legal interpretation
that a service which is not making a profit
could not be considered a commercial air
service would obviously lead to grave
difficulties. One of the amendments includes
a definition of "hire or reward" which will
eliminate doubt on this score.
Another change relates to the jurisdiction
of Canadian authorities over Canadian aircraft and Canadian commercial air services
when operating outside the territorial limits
of Canada. Hitherto the Aeronautics Act
has covered jurisdiction within Canadian
territory. It is obviously desirable that there
should be some relationship between the
regulations as applied to Canadian aircraft
and Canadian commercial air services within
Canada-for example, as to safety, fares and
tariffs-and the regulations as applied outside
of Canadian territory. Moreover, the Canadian government as a party to the Internaand
tional Civil Aviation Convention
numerous bilateral air agreements with other
countries, authorizing international air services, has with other governments assumed
responsibility for the actions of its own
carriers and aircraft. In order to carry out
these commitments to other governments it
is necessary that Canadian authorities have
jurisdiction over Canadian aircraft and
Canadian commercial air services when operating outside Canada. Changes are proposed
to both Part I and Part II to meet this
situation.
In certain circumstances the military aircraft of the Department of National Defence
may be availed of, and remuneration may
be accepted from other departments of the
government for services performed, in the air
survey field, for example. These operations
should be dealt with on an interdepartmental
basis, and the government does not intend
to require that the R.C.A.F. should be licensed
as a regular commercial air carrier or be
subject to the regulations applied to commercial air services. An amendment to the

SENATE

Act will therefore exempt military aircraft
from the jurisdiction of the civil authorities
over commercial air services.
In the licensing of commercial air carriers,
the Air Transport Board is required to determine public convenience and necessity before
authorizing any scheduled air service, and
public interest before authorizing any other
type of commercial air service. Since scheduled international air services are a subject of
intergovernmental agreement, an amendment
is included which will permit the board to
exempt international scheduled services from
the finding of public convenience and necessity. Otherwise, this requirement would add
unnecessary procedural difficulties in implementing bilateral agreements and be inconsistent with obligations assumed by the
government with other governments.
Experience has also demonstrated that the
clauses providing for penalties in the event of
violation of the law are not entirely consistent with similar clauses in other federal
statutes, and have not been a sufficient
deterrent to wrong-doing. Changes will be
made which will bring these clauses into line
with similar clauses in other legislation, and
provide for somewhat stiffer penalties.
This explanation of some of the points contained in the bill will give an indication of its
purpose and of the type of detailed amendment which it contains.
As the subject-matter is detailed and largely
technical in nature, it is my intention, if and

when the house has seen fit to give the bill
second reading, to move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications, where officials of the Air
Transport Board and any other officials whose
presence honourable senators may require
will be in attendance to give detailed answers
to such questions as may occur to the committee, and where interested parties will be
able to appear if they so desire.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not the intention, if the
bill receives second reading this evening, to
go ahead with it at once? I assume that persons who wish to be heard will get sufficient
notice.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I believe certain interests have intimated that they wish to be
heard, and I suggest that their wish be complied with. As far as I know there is no
immediate urgency.

THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
NEWSPAPER ARTICLES-PRIVILEGE

On the orders of the day:
Hon. A. Marcotte: Honourable senators,
I rise to a question of privilege. I was
rather puzzled yesterday when I heard my
honourable leader here (Hon. Mr. Haig) refer
to some articles which had been published
in the Winnipeg Free Press. Upon making
inquiries I found that certain articles-probably those to which he referred-had been
condensed and appeared in that form in
last Saturday's issue of the Ottawa Journal.
I join with the leader on our side in
expressing my respect and admiration for
the work done by the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), but I
strongly object to a certain paragraph
published in the Ottawa Journal last Saturday, April 22, and which is as follows:
Indeed, as a matter of legislative record, the
Senate has never been called upon to decide more
than a few unimportant questions involving the
rights of any province as against the Dominion.

I think this statement is most incorrect
and that the honourable senator would not
have included it in his article had he just
read once more the remarks made in this
chamber by the late senators Murphy and
Èench. I do not intend to enter into a
controversy on this subject today, but I give
notice now that within a few days I shall
move a resolution which will enable us
to have a free debate on the matter. If it is
desired, I am ready to proceed now to

prove that no matter how admirable, this
article may be in its entirety, the particular
passage I have quoted is in error. I shall
leave it to the house to decide whether I
should proceed now or wait until I move
my resolution.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Give the proper notice.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not intend to reply
to my honourable friend from Ponteix (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte), but I should like to thank
him for raising this point. I do not think it
is proper to discuss in this chamber now
any articles appearing in the press, but a
free debate on this subject, after it has
been properly introduced by resolution, would
prove most interesting.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators,
I accordingly give notice now that within
a day or two I shall move a resolution that
will give us an opportunity to discuss this
matter.

committees.
remember it, was that as the Senate makes a
great deal of use of standing committees to
consider proposed legislation, it was only fair
and reasonable to increase the number of
their members sufficiently to enable as many
senators as possible to take part in their
deliberations. As honourable senators know,
the device of examining bills in detail in
committee of the whole is not frequently
adopted in this chamber, for reasons on which
I shall comment later.
In actual practice, as honourable senators
know, a very large part of the legislation that
is referred to standing committees is assigned
te the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
That committee might be regarded as our
main standing committee on legislation, and
I do not think there is the slightest doubt that
the increase in its membership from 42 to 50,
which was approved in 1045, vas justified.
I have looked over the lists of senators
on standing and joint committees, and my
opinion-which I express for what it is
worth-is that the size of most of the committees is about right. But I would raise
a question about what may be termed
"specialist" committees, such as those which
deal with natural resources, immigration and
labour, Canadian trade relations, public
health and welfare, external relations, and,
perhaps, finance and transport and communications, but with some reservations as to the
latter. These committees are large. It is my
impression that there bas been a tendency to
nominate to these particular committees not
only senators who are specially interested
in the subject-matter allotted to such conmittees, but quite a number of other senators
who have no such specific interest. I do
not make much of the point, but I hope
that the committee which is about to be
set up will discuss the question whether
the work of these "specialist" committees
would not be more efficient if their membership were not quite so large. As I have
said, I think the Banking and Commerce
Committee is about the right size, but I
admit to some doubt about the committees
on finance and on transport and communications. But whether my views in this particular respect are acceptable or not, I trust
that the question of the size of the conmittees will be reviewed.
Now, a word with regard to the organization
of the standing committees. I am speaking

occasion to voice the hope that this body,
besides assuming the responsibility of dealing with any legislation which comes before

cerns the rather difficult problem that I
have always had to face in discharging my
duty of recommending to honourable senators
when the Senale should sit and when it
should adjourn. In the past the opening of
parliament bas usually occurred on a Thursday, and the Senate bas then adjourned until
the follow ing Tuesday. This long week-end
adjournment is needed so that the benches

session did not commence until twenty-four
or twenty-five days after the commencement of the session. The committee is set
up without anyone knowing exactly when it
will be able to begin its sittings, because
of uncertainty as to the duration of the
debate on the Address and as to legislation
that may come before the house prior to
the first adjournment. Consequently those
who are interested in the presentation of
divorce petitions are uncertain when they
can be heard; and further, after the Divorce
Committee bas been organized, some ten
days or two weeks must elapse before witnesses can be called.
Immediately after the opening of parliament the question always arises whether
the Senate should adjourn pending the
organization of committees. This is perhaps
not serious to those members who live in
the immediate vicinity of Ottawa, but to
those who live farther away it is important.

APRIL 27. 1950
I want to propose now-because it dovetails
into the whole organization of our committees-that the special committee, and indeed the Senate itself, give some consideration
to the suggestion that on the opening day
of the next session of parliament the deputy
leader move for the appointment of the
Committee of Selection.
This committee
could bring in a report the following day
and we could sit, if only briefly, to set
up the Divorce Committee. I should not
at that time be so concerned about the
appointment of personnel to the other committees, but I should certainly like to see
the Divorce Committee set up.
I am advised by the Clerk of Committees
that if he knew in advance that we were
going to stay here and go on with our committee work right through till Easter, whether
or not there was legislation to keep us busy
in the Senate, it would be possible to have
the Divorce Committee begin its work on
the Monday after the opening of parliament
instead of, as formerly, two or three weeks
from that time; and I would suggest that
those who assume the responsibility of serving on the Divorce Committee could then, by
proceeding as expeditiously as possible, clean
up its work for the session before Easter.
I think it should be made known that persons
wishing to make applications to the committee should have their cases ready to proceed
when parliament opens; and in my opinion
the committee's sittings should not be allowed
to run on into the la.te spring and summer,
and thereby cause hardship to those senators
who have been public spirited enough to
participate in the onerous duties of the
Divorce Committee.
I also hope that the practice adopted this
year of bringing down the estimates early
in the session will be continued, and that our
respective committees to whom these are
to be referred will be in a position to begin
functioning promptly after the opening of
the session.
Also I think that those senators who desire
to have matters dealt with by special committees should endeavour to have the committees appointed and start working as early
as possible in the session. Of course, as
honourable members know, we cannot have
a large number of special committees sitting
at once, for then it becomes difficult for some
committees to obtain a quorum; so at times
it might become necessary to have someone
act as arbiter, to decide which committees
should be given precedence.
In brief, honourable senators, my suggestion is that we should finish up our divorce
work, our special committee work and our
study of the estimates as early as possible
55950-16j

in the session, and that then, when we have
dealt with whatever legislation is before us
and it appears that no further legislation is
imminent, we should adjourn the Senate until
such time as there will be something more
for us to do.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: But before I would
move that the Senate adjourn, I should want
to have all the work before us completed.
I would therefore suggest to honourable
senators that, beginning next session, we
remove all doubt as to the possibility of an
early adjournment by deciding to stay here
from the beginning of the session until we
have finished with our divorce work, special
committee work and the consideration of
whatever legislative measures are before us.
I admit that unless there is a change from
the practice that has prevailed ever since I
have been a member of this bouse, there is
not likely to be any legislation introduced
here in the first two or three weeks of the
session. Let us take advantage of that situation by getting our various committees into
full-time operation during that period. For,
mark you, honourable senators, our reporting
staff is not large enough to handle the proceedings of two sections of the Divorce Committee and of one or two special committees,
if these are sitting when lengthy debates are
proceeding in the Senate. I just mention
this as another reason why we should finish
as much as possible of our divorce work in
the early part of the session. Let us make
a virtue of necessity, and concentrate on committee work when there are no bills before
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question?
The leader's remarks, it seems to me, are
based on the assumption that the estimates
will be brought down early in the session.
Have we any assurance that this will be so?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I can only say that the
early bringing down of the estimates in the
present session has worked out very well, and
I hope this will develop into a regular practice.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Aside from the divorce
work, the estimates would be the only things
upon which we could expect to proceed right
after the opening of parliament.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I cannot give any
definite assurance on the matter. I would suggest however, even if the specific estimates
were not ready when our committees were
formed, that the whole question of governmental expenditure in this country has
reached such proportions-not only in
amount, but in complexity-that a committee

SENATE
could well spend a week or two getting
ready to ask questions on the estimates. I
should hope that in future sessions the estimates would be brought down as early as
they were this year; but I am not able to
give the house any assurance in this respect.
I should like to get away once and for all
from the past uncertainty that has prevailed
shortly after the opening of every session, as
to whether the Senate should or should not
be adjourned, with half the members urging
me to move for adjournment and the other
half urging against it, so that I have sometimes felt like tossing a penny to decide the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Is there any limit to the
number of divorces that may be granted in a
year?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no limit.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Then, the number might
so increase as to keep a committee going
indefinitely.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is a time limit
for the filing of petitions, and of course it is
within the power of the Senate to fix a date
beyond which no more applications will be
heard until the following session. If all the
divorce cases for each session were dealt with
before Easter, the chairman and other members of the committee would not be deprived,
as they now are, of the opportunity to participate later in the session in the work of other
committees in which they are especially interested.
If honourable senators have any questions
to ask as I go along, I shall be happy to hear
them. They would give me a chance to collect my thoughts.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: May I ask the honourable
leader a question?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should be delighted.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I understand him to say
that he had some definite ideas to submit on
reform of the Senate, but it was not clear to
me whether his proposals were to be submitted to this committeeHon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: -or to the federai-provincial conference.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: If the minister has some
definite proposals to make, would it not be
proper to inform the house what they are?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have none. I
expressed the opinion that in due course proposals affecting the constitution of the Senate
would be made, and I went on to say:
As to constitutional reform of the Senate, I should
hope that some definite proposals concerning the

amending of its constitution would be forthcoming
through the ordinary channels during the life of
this parliament. If this appears to be unlikely, it
it my intention to make definite proposals for
Senate reform, on my own responsibility as Senate
leader, for the consideration of this house and the
public generally.

I have no intention whatever of making any
proposals today.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would the honourable
gentleman clarify what he means by "ordinary

channels"?

Hon. Mr. Robertson:

As my

honourable

friend knows, any legislative measures introduced in this house, aside from private bills,
originate with the government.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But the provinces also
might have a say in this matter.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should hardly imagine they could initiate legislation in the
Senate. I have no intention of entering into
a discussion as to who should or should not
introduce proposals for Senate reform; but if
none were forthcoming from any source I, on
my own responsibility, would bring forward
some for consideration by the Senate and by
the public generally.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Do I understand that
whether or not the government makes any
proposals for Senate reform at the federalprovincial conference, our leader himself
has some proposals that he personally intends
to make? That is what I understand from
his remarks.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: What I intended to say
to the house was that for some time I have
had personal opinions as to constitutional
reform of the Senate. As to whether and
when I shall express them depends on
whether specific proposals are forthcoming
from other quarters. I am giving myself
considerable scope. As I say, I hope that
during the life of this parliament some proposals will be made. Failing that, I intend
to make my own suggestions in this matter,
for the consideration of the Senate and the
public generally.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Does not our leader think
that he should first subrmit his proposals for
reform to the Senate for its consideration,
rather than to the federal-provincial conference?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I assure my friend that
I did not mean to suggest that I would make
any proposals to the federal-provincial conference. If I have any proposals to make, it
is my intention to make them to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: That is not what the honourable leader said.

APRIL 27, 1950
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not remember
the slightest reference to a dominion-provincial conference; but if'I did refer to it in
the way suggested, I must ask that what I said
be withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask a question concerning the problem of the hearing by the
Senate of divorces from those provinces which
have no divorce courts? I have recently read
articles in the press to the effect that the
Senate may be relieved of hearing divorce
cases, and that they may be dealt with by the
Exchequer Court of Canada. Has that question been discussed by the government?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Perhaps my honourable friend was not present at the organization meeting of the committees, when the
matter was discussed. Certain suggestions
have been made about the divorce question;
but as far as I know nothing bas actually been
done. I feel that as long as the task is ours
it should continue to be performed in the
same efficient manner as it bas been in the
past. My only concern has been to ease the
burden on those who have so willingly
assumed this responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Baird: In view of the fact that
reform of the Senate is being considered
would it not be well to eliminate the divorce
question?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Of course the procedure with regard to divorce is in essence
simply that of introducing bills and passing
them. Whether this should or should not
continue is a big question, and one which I
cannot answer.
I should like to refer to the problem of the
timing of the activities of committees in relation to the opening of parliament. Also
I wish to bring up the question of the method
to be adopted in organizing committees, apart
from the Divorce Committee.
Honourable members know that after the
members of the various committees are
appointed an organization meeting is held by
each committee, as selected, and nominations
for chairman take place. As government
leader I have carried on the tradition and
practice of nominating a chairman for each
of the committees; apart from the Committee
on Divorce, which chooses its own chairman.
The observation has been made that such
procedure is not altogether democratic.
While I am quite content to continue in this
manner, I have no objection to change, if it
is the wish of honourable senators. The suggestion has been made that the special committee should consider and report on this
question of the appointment of chairmen,
and that then the Senate could make up its
mind once for all as to the practice to be

f ollowed. If it is the desire of the house that
standing committees choose their own chairmen, that is quite satisfactory to me.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is the present practice set
out in our rules, or is it a matter of tradition.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think it is tradition.
In keeping with the practice of my predecessor in office, when selecting chairmen, 1
have brought to bear various factors, namely
geographie location, experience, seniority
and so on. In this respect I should like to
point to a rather delicate matter and suggest that the committee give serious consideration to it. I have in mind the tenure
of office of a chairman. As matters stand
at the present time, I re-nominate the same
chairman year after year, until he resigns
or I suggest him for another committee. I
do not think that is good practice, but it is
difficult for a leader to say to a chairman
who is known to all of us as a man of high
calibre, wide experience and good judgment,
that he should relinquish his office. It does
seem to me, therefore, that we should stipulate a period of service, at the end of which a
chairman, however excellent, would become
ineligible for the office.
Such procedure
would give another capable person an opportunity to render service in that particular
field. I may say that my problem is not
caused by scarcity of talent, but rather by
the wealth of material to choose from.
I come now to. a problem in connection
with the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce which, apart from the Committee
of the Whole, is our chief legislative committee. Though a great many members are
anxious to sit on this committee, its full
membership rèpresents only, half, the Senate
There are many, cases of members who have
been re-appointed to the committee year after
year, and for various reasons-some beyond
their control have been unable to attend the
meetings of the committee. Such a condition,
if it continues for long, is detrimental to the
committee, as many senators who would like
to participate in the activities of the committee are unable to do so. To remedy that
situation I think there should be a general
rule that if a committee member does not
attend for a year-or perhaps two yearshe should not be re-nominated as a member.
Our general practice has not taken that
situation into consideration.
I now wish to devote a few remarks to
the subject of greater use of Committee of
the Whole. This question has been discussed
at various times. Although many senators
are on committees which deal with legislation-for example, the Banking and Commerce Committee, which has fifty members

SENATE

-the Senate has a membership of 102. So
at least half of the membership of the Senate,
although not precluded from attending the
committee meetings and asking questions,
cannot vote; and there is often some reluctance to attend, particularly on the part of
junior senators who are not members. In
consequence, over the years at different times
there has been a good deal of insistence
that the device of the Committee of the
Whole should be used to a greater extent
than is our practice, so that individual
senators who are not members of the Committee on Banking and Commerce might
have some opportunity of hearing and discussing points of detail. Generally speaking,
a bill, after being thoroughly discussed in that
committee, comes here for third reading and
is reported without much debate. The same
remark applies to measures which have been
referred to other standing committees.
Hon. Mr. King: There is nothing to prohibit
discussion.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No. There is no prohibition of discussion upon third reading.
This brings me to the question whether
it would not be desirable to refer bills to
the Committee of the Whole, so that any
honourable senator can speak on any part
of them in which he is interested. I think
this is the kernel of the matter. If a bill
goes to Committee of the Whole, as one
clause follows another, inevitably there
arises in the mind of this or that senator
some question which particularly affects his
constituency or in which he is otherwise
interested. If he were attending a meeting
of a standing committee at which a minister,
his parliamentary assistant, or some specialist,
were present, he would probably ask a
question based on his particular interest, and
perhaps having received an answer, would
make some comments on the matter. As
we are organized at present, I do not think
it is possible to set up a system whereby
satisfactory answers could be given to any
question which any honourable senator might
ask in Committee of the Whole. As far
as introducing legislation, outlining its scope,
and explaining its underlying principles is
concerned, I am confident that following
some preparation and consideration-by making use of the talent that is available-a
presentation can be made which, without
disrespect to the ministers and parliamentary
assistants in the other place, will bear comparison with the presentations made there.
But when it comes to answering a whole
range of questions covering the general field
of the subject-matter, more detailed knowledge is required than I, as minister, possess;
and it would be hardly fair for me to ask or

expect any of my colleagues to become
sufficiently conversant with all the administrative details and 'related features of a particular measure to provide, even with officials
in front of us, as full and complete answers
as honourable senators may think they are
entitled to. I suppose that this is one of
the reasons why, over the years, we have
depended to a greater extent on our standing committees, where officials attend and
can reply to questions put to them.
Consequently, if it is desired to make
greater use of the Committee of the Whole,
it seems to me that the only possible way
of doing so, year in and year out, is to
amend our rules to enable a minister or
his parliamentary assistant, with his officials,
to attend and answer questions. Presumably
the minister or his assistant, with the help
of permanent officials, would be in a position
to do this.
As honourable senators may recall, our
rules were amended to provide that a minister might corne into this house and participate in the debate on a bill on second reading,
or in Committee of the Whole, provided that
the bill had ori;inated in the Senate, but
not if it had been initiated in the other place.
So if it were held desirable to avail ourselves
of the Committee of the Whole to a greater
extent than we do now-and there is much
to be said for this practice-the committee
contemplated in this resolution might consider the advisability of so amending our
rules as to permit the attendance in Committee of the Whole of the responsible minister,
his parliamentary assistant, and his officials,
regardless of whether the legislation had been
introduced in this house or in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Have we not already that
right, or privilege?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: A minister can come
into this house only on legislation introduced
in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: I have a recollection that
some assistants, perhaps heads of departments, were here many years ago. I remember that Honourable Senator Dandurand
brought them in here two or three times.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Oh yes, officials can
come here; but the suggestion is that the
minister or his parliamentary assistant shall
be here as spokesman, and may have his
officials in front of him if the maximum of
information is desired. What little experience I have leads me to believe that honourable senators would be interested in putting
questions, receiving answers, and carrying on
a discussion after replies were obtained.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The officials, not the ministers or parliamentary assistants, would be
the ones who would have the information.

APRIL 27, 1950
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They might be able to
interpret it better, perhaps.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: They are not allowed to
speak in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am by no means suggesting that the activities of the committee
should be confined to the suggestions I have
made. I hope that honourable senators who
have had far more experience in this chamber
and in parliamentary life than I have will
contribute their suggestions for the benefit
of the committee. However, I have advanced
these views after five years' experience as
leader of the Senate, in the hope that they
will at least provide something to which the
special committee will give consideration if
the Senate in its wisdom concurs in the
resolution to appoint such a committee.
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: Relative to the work
of the Committee on Estimates: one committee on which I have the honour to serve
was attended by some six or eight senators;
departmental officials attended; questions
were asked and some valuable information
was elicited. But no record was kept. The
information contained in the answers could
in no way come to the knowledge of other
honourable senators; neither could the questions and answers be known to the elected
representatives of the people in the other
place. I am just wondering what is the value
of carrying on in this way. It seems to me
that the questions and answers 'just go into
thin air, and that unless some fear is put into
the minds of the officials, no value is derived
in the way of making amendments. I should
like to know if it is the practice to have no
record made in these committees on estimates. Just what is the purpose of these
committees if the information obtained is not
available to all honourable senators, and no
opportunity is given for definite action in
the way of making corrections?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
donot propose to follow the line of the leader

explained some of the subjects that he thinks
should be dealt with by the special committee,
anything I might say now about any action
to be taken by the committee would be
unfair to both myself and the committee. I
might be pre-judging the ultimate decisions
of the committee.
I should like to point out, however, that
only twelve of approximately ninety members of the Senate have been named to this
special committee. I believe, therefore, that
the remaining members would be performing
a useful service if they were to pass on to
this special committee their own views and

ideas about the problems raised by the leader.
This could be done by way of individual
memoranda, and it would certainly assist the
special committee in its work. For instance,
the striking committee meets at the opening
of parliament to nominate senators to serve
on the various standing committees during
the ensuing session. The leaders of the government and of the opposition automatically
act as members of that committee. At least,
this has been the practice in the fifteen years
I have been here. It is then the practice for
the two leaders to propose names of senators
whom they wish to serve on the various committees, and appointments are usually made
without question. Further, the leader of the
government and the leader of the opposition
are members of eight or nine different committees. I have had people call me up and
say, "Now, look here, such and such a committee meets tomorrow morning and you are
a member of it". Well, perhaps two or three
other committees are meeting at the same
time, and I have to decide which one to
attend. To put an end to this sort of thing
I would suggest that the special committee
consider making the two Senate leaders
ex-officio members of all committees except
the Committee on Divorce. I am sure the
leader of the government, like myself, is
eager to attend any Senate committee that
may be sitting; but when several committees
are meeting at the same time, the problem is
to decide which one to attend.
I agree with the leader that we should
organize our committees right at the beginning of the session. .I admit that I have
attended only two or three openings of this
house in the last fifteen years, one of them
being when I was sworn in; but I do not
think it right to ask those of us who live in
the far east or the far west to come all the
way to Ottawa for one day and then to sit
around idle for four or five days. I also
entirely agree with the leader's proposal that
the Committee of Selection be appointed on
the day that parliament opens, and that the
Divorce Committee be set up the following
day. The Committees Branch could then
notify divorce petitioners that the Divorce
Committee would commence its hearings on
Strictly
the following Monday morning.
speaking, of course, the divorce petitioners
are supposed to receive so many days' notice;
but there are always many of them who are
willing and eager to have their cases heard
immediately. Then, as is the practice this
year, the Divorce Committee could meet from
Monday through to Saturday. I also think
that those seeking divorces should be told
that no more petitions will be accepted when
the list is closed. In other words, anyone
who is not ready to proceed with his case

SENATE

when parliament opens will have to wait until
the following session. There is no doubt that
we do not like the job of handling divorces.
The longer one serves on the committee the
more one dislikes it, and finally he rebels and
some other fellow takes his place for a while.
The courts of our country set aside certain
days for hearings, and if a case is not on the
list it has to wait a month or sL weeks until
another list is ready. The sarne principle
should apply here. Petitioners come to us on
a Monday and say, "I am on the list for
today, but I am not ready to proceed. I
would like to be heard on Thursday". This
is not right.
It must be very nice to live as close to
Canada's capital as do the Ontario and Quebec members; but we who come from the
four western and four eastern provinces
would like to work five days a week in an
effort to clean up our business and then be
allowed to go home until such times as new
legislation comes to us from another place.
This is what we should like, and what any
sensible person should like, anyone who says
otherwise is drawing on his imagination.
I have just one more point to make. I
regret that rny honourable friend from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) bas left the chamber.
The leader suggested that before this session
terminates the government should introduce
a plan for the constitutional reform of the
Senate. He added that if this were not donc
he would be prepared to submit certain constitutional ideas of his own to the Senate. This
is his right and privilege, but I would recommend to all honourable senators that they
read over several things I shall mention. First,
they should read the memorandum prepared
by the Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate,
Mr. MacNeill, on the debates that took place
at the time of confederation. This will explain
why the Senate was put in our constitutional
system. Then I would ask them to read the
House of Commons Hansard of 1886. That
is really something! Confederation had been
in existence only nineteen years, and Sir
John A. Macdonald, one of the chief fathers
of confederation, was still Prime Minister of
Canada. In 1867 he nominated to the Senate,
seventy-two persons who were in favour of
confederation: thirty-six with Liberal views
and thirty-six with Conservative views. In
1873 his government was defeated and the
Honourable Alexander Mackenzie became
Prime Minister. During Mackenzie's term of
office from 1873 to 1878 some of the senators
passed on and their places were filled. In
1886, during the course of the budget debate
in the House of Commons Mr. Mills, a former
member of the Mackenzie government and
a former Minister of Justice, moved an
amendment criticizing the Senate. It has

struck me that some newspapers which have
been criticizing the Senate within the last
three months must have copied parts of Mr.
Mills' speech almost verbatim. The editors
probably had not the ability to write such
material themselves. Sir John A. Macdonald
replied to Mr. Mills, and I can assure you that
if tomorrow the Prime Minister was challenged by opposition in another place he
could present a perfect answer simply by
reading Macdonald's speech. After explaining
the purpose of the Senate, Macdonald said,
in effect, "My honourable friend complains
that senators do not want to do any work,
and that they do not represent the people.
Well, whom do we in the House of Commons
represent? I maintain that I have the confidence of this house, and that my supporters
have the confidence of the people. And the
Senate also must be carrying out the wishes
of the people, for it has always accepted the
legislation we have passed."
Sir John pointed out that during the five
years when the Alexander Mackenzie government was in office the majority in the
Senate was politically hostile to that government's policy, but he asked Mr. Mills if there
had ever been any trouble in getting its legislation through this house. Then he went on
to refer to the British constitution, and he
discussed the problems peculiar to an clective chamber. Macdonald's speech is a most
interesting one and well worth reading
today. I believe that if some of our newspaper editors would take time to read it and
to quote what he said in reply to Mr. Mills,
there would not be so much agitation on this
question.
Senate reform was advocated sixty-four
years ago. No reform had been proposed
prior to that, either by Macdonald or
Mackenzie. Macdonald and his Conservative
successors remained in office until 1896, and
there was no move to reform the Senate in
that period. Then from 1896 to 1911 we had
another great Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. At the beginning of his tern the
Senate was composed almost entirely of Conservatives, yet I can find no record of any
important reform of the Senate advocated
by him. Sir Robert Borden, another eminent
Prime Minister, came to power in 1911, and
again there was a politically hostile Senate,
but the only difference that occurred between
him and this chamber was over his proposal
that the number of senators from Western
Canada be increased from sixteen to twentyfour, in order that the representation of the
four Western provinces might be equal to
that of the other three senatorial divisions.
The Senate agreed to the increase, with the
proviso that it should not become effective
until after the next election. I think the

APRIL 27, 1950
Senate was right in that, and apparenly Sir
Robert Borden thought so too, for he raised
no objection.
Honourable senators will recall that a few
years ago the government of the day fell in
line with the stand taken by the Senate on
another question. The government brought
down a bill to make the Foreign Exchange
Control Act permanent legislation. This house
did not like that and, by a large majority,
suggested that the extension of the Act be
limited to two or three years. In one of our
committees the Acting Minister of Finance,
who is now the minister, was asked what
he thought about the suggestion, and he said
that he personally had no objections, but he
did not know whether the government would
agree to it. However, within two or three
days he notified us that the government was
agreeable.
I mention these instances by way of pointing out that when the Senate makes an
amendment to any part of the government's
program, it does not do so out of hostility to
the government.
My honourable friend has suggested constitutional reform of the Senate. Well, the
Senate cannot be constitutionally reformed
without its own consent. That statement may
be challenged, but I assert that that is one
of the results of the legislation passed last fall
by the United Kingdom Parliament to enable
Canada to amend its own constitution. Prior
to that time, if the House of Commons had
passed a resolution addressed to the Imperial
Parliament, praying for Senate reform, that
parliament, with a socialist majority in the
House of Commons, might have acted on the
resolution.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You may be right, but my
point is that the United Kingdom Parliament
could have done that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman? Does our constitution
not provide that such resolutions have to be
presented by way of a joint address from both
houses of parliament?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it does not. The practice
has been to have resolutions accompanied by
a joint address, but I cannot find anything
making this necessary.
I feel sure that there is no member of
this house who is not wholeheartedly in
favour of making the Senate the most useful
body that it can be in our system of confederation; and if in order to bring that about
it is necessary to reform this chamber by
changing either the method or term of
appointment, or in any other way, that would
have the support of every senator. It goes

without saying that we would not be fit to
be senators if that were not so. At the same
time let us keep in the back of our minds
the purpose for which the Senate was created.
I am not going into that further just now,
t
for the whole matter is fully · reated in the
speeches by Mills and Macdonald and the
review by Mr. MacNeill.
I should like a newspaper editor or a
demagogue inside or outside parliament-for
there may be some in parliament-to point
out to me one instance in the eighty-three
years of confederation when the Senate acted
contrary to the purpose for which it was
originally established. Further, I should like
someone to refer me to a single instance in
which the Senate resisted the House of Commons and that house came back and fought
the Senate on the issue. Nobody can show
me an instance of either kind, for there has
never been one. In the election campaign
of 1917 Sir Robert Borden did not make
an issue out of the Senate's refusal to agree
to an increase in the number of Western
senators until after the election. He did not
complain, as he might have done, that the
Senate took this stand in the hope that the
Liberals might win the election and have
the say as to who the new senator should be.
That question was never raised at all.
I am glad that the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has proposed the
appointment of this committee, and I say
again that I hope every senator will realize
the importance of the committee's work. It
is in the interest of all of us and of the
country at large that this committee should
have placed before it all the useful suggestions and information that can be obtained,
and I would ask every senator who is not
on the committee to co-operate with us to
the fullest in this respect.
One problem that I think should be discussed was brought to my mind by the senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid).
When T first came here I felt as I think he
does, that a new member finds it difficult
to be appointed to committees where he
thinks he can do the most good. It is all
very well to say that every senator is free
to attend the meetings of any committee,
but one does not like to take part in the
proceedings of a committee of which one is
not a member. I was at such a committee
yesterday, and somebody wanted to know
why I was so quiet. I did not dare let on
that I was not a member of the committee.
Honourable members, I hope the house will
see fit to pass this resolution. Whatever the
result, I trust that it will make the Senate
more efficient and useful to the people of

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: The honourable leader opposite paid a compliment to the honourable
member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and myself, when he suggested that we
should do a little thinking. It occurs to me
that my friend is offering a rather negative
defence of the Senate when he says that in
all its eighty odd years it has never done
anything wrong. Would it not be better to
tell the people of the good things it has
done?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The late Senator Murphy,
in his speech, covered that subject fully. I
do not wish to enter into that branch of the
argument for the reason that it is not necessary to do so to meet the charge which the
Senate is facing. The charge against this
house is either that it is useless or that it is
a threat at the present time to provincial
legislatures whose parties have no representation here. Let us suppose that at the
next general election there was a swing
towards the Social Credit party. There
would then be a fear that this house would
resist the proposals of such a government.
I do not think that such prejudices exist in
this chamber. If my honourable friend will
refer to the speech of the late Senator
Murphy be will see that this house refused
to approve certain railway extensions, the
estimated cost of which would have been
sufficient to pay the salaries of senators for
the next hundred years.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is a better defence
than to say that it has done nothing wrong.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are many cases in
which the Senate resisted the passage of
legislation proposing expenditures. I did not
mention those points because they do not
answer the charges made by the press.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
as one of the junior members of this house,
I have not the temerity to present my views
on the question of reformation to be considered in this chamber. I rise particularly
to commend the honourable leader of the
government for introducing his resolution
concerning the functions of the Senate committees, and to say a word about those committees to which the estimates have been
referred.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) brought me into the debate this afternoon by saying that when he came to the
Senate he was like the member from New
Westminster-eager to get on committees. I
want to assure him that I take my committee
work seriously, and the day that I am unable
to attend the meetings of the committee of
which I am a member I shall resign. When
I get on a committee I want to go to work;

and I believe that before a member is reappointed it should be shown that he has
attended the meetings of the previous session. I do not believe in the age-old practice
-that just because a man has been here for
years that he should be re-appointed to certain committees year after year. I think
there is a great deal of merit in the suggestion that the records of the committee should
be examined in order to determine what
members are attending the meetings.
My suggestion has to do with the standing
committees which are studying the estimates.
It is perhaps too early to judge the results
of their work, but I think they are doing a
splendid job. I would point out to the leader
of the government that the most serious
matter before parliament is the tremendous
government expenditure which is taking
place.
It would seem that the various
branches of the government are vying with
each other to see how much money they can
spend.
Those of us who have had experience
in the other house know full well how the
estimates are prepared. The minister has no
time to prepare the estimates for his department, so his deputy comes up with an estimate of, say, $200 million for the year.
Then some move is made before the Treasury Board, and the estimates are placed
before parliament. Everybody knows that
what happens in the other place by way of
review of expenditures is just a farce. Up to
the present time the estimates have been left
until the dying days of the session, and we
have all seen a billion dollars voted within
half an hour. Nobody has had the temerity
to call a halt to such procedure. I am wondering whether we in this house, who are not
looking for votes, will dare to call a halt on
some of the expenditures which appear to
have got out of hand, or whether the same
psychology, that the government must be
supported at any cost, will continue.
I am just a little concerned about the
results of the work we are doing in the
committees. There is a great deal to be said
for the American system-of course it cannot
be introduced here-under which the estimates of the government go before a Senate
committee, where they are pared down. The
Americans have an advantage over us in that
respect, and I think the special committee
which is now being set up would do well to
consider the appointment of two or three
standing committees to consider the estimates.
In that way we would not spread the subject
amongst so many committees, and there
would be some check as to overlapping of
expenditures.

APRIL 27, 1950
Later the committees could bring in
recommendations with a view to economy
and, if necessary, we could eliminate certain of the estimates placed before parliament. I think that if standing committees
for considering the estimates could be set up
along the lines I suggest, a greater service
would be done for the people of Canada than
we are now doing by giving relief to a few
people through the work of the Divorce Comnittee.

THE LATE SENATOR JONES
TRIEUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the orders of the day:
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with, I regret that I must officially
advise the house of the death of one of our
colleagues, the Honourable George Burpee
Jones, P.C., of Royal, New Brunswick, who
died on the 27th of April. Senator Jones was
born at Belleiste Bay, New Brunswick, on
January 9, 1866, the son of Stephen Jones and
Susan Eliza, his wife. He was educated at
Apohaqui Superior School. He was a merchant, and for many years was president of
Jones Brothers Limited, of Apohaqui, a leading New Brunswick lumber firm, and of the
Bayside Lumber Company Limited. He held
directorships in the New Brunswick Telephone Company and the Maritime Trust
Company, and was Vice-President of General
Dairies. For more than fifty years he was

chamber in 1935, and brought here a very
wide business and political experience. Until
a comparatively recent date, when illness
prevented his doing so, he was a faithful

MAY 2, 1950
attendant of the Senate. He was interested
in all public matters, and was always anxious
and willing to do everything in his power ta
advance the interest of his native province.
He will be widely missed by his colleagues
here.
Senator Jones is survived by a daughter,
Mrs. Frank McMalkin and a son, Colby, and
to them we extend our sincere sympathy in
their bereavement.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
this is the second time within a week that I
have had occasion ta rise in my place and
speak of the passing of one of my party colleagues. I shall miss George Jones very
much. His life furnished one of the outstanding illustrations of the high place that a
young man, starting out with nothing, can
carve out for himself in the business, educational and political life of Canada. Few, if
any, men have enjoyed such a long political
career without a single defeat. The records
show that a few weeks after his last re-election ta the New Brunswick legislature, in
October 1921, he resigned from that body and
successfully contested an election for a seat
in the House of Commons.
I think the experience of the late senator
as chairman of Apohaqui Superior Schools,
a position which he held for fifty-eight years
without defeat, and in which he was only
twice opposed, was most unusual. I doubt
if his record has ever been equalled; certainly
it has never been surpassed.
Our late colleague made his greatest contribution ta business. Having started in very
humble circumstances, he worked for two or
three years at practically apprentice's pay,
and later developed a business that was
unique in the Dominion of Canada. Though
be operated in a small town of not more than
five hundred people, I am sure be left a record
of business acument which has seldom been
equalled.
George Burpee Jones started his career in
a small province that had only a fair amount
of natural resources, but be carved out for
himself a great career. Such a thing cauld
only happen in a country like Canada, and in
view of the development that has taken place
since 1866, our late colleague's example
should be most encouraging ta our young
men and women who are starting out today.
Sa much for the public side of George Burpee
Jones.
As a member of the Senate he was a unique
individual. I think we all realize at times
that we should not indulge too much in politics. But I do not think it is bad for a man
ta remember the early days, when we had
keen contests for political positions, and ta
recall the trials and tribulations of those days

and the things he did for his party or for
himself, which in his heart of hearts he knows
were really done for his country. I am sure
that when George Burpee Jones went into
the provincial legislature be did so because
he liked the political activity and the combat;
but by and large be did what he did for his
province. He got a lot from the province
of New Brunswick, and he wanted ta return
a lot ta it. Then when be stepped into the
wider sphere of Dominion political life he no
doubt did so because he still liked the exhilaration that comes with the battle; but I am
sure that his real motive was ta work for the
benefit of Canada. I have talked ta our late
colleague about these matters and I know
his attitude in relation ta them. I therefore
find it hard ta say what I have ta say this
afternoon. Several times be told me: "Jack,
Canada bas been good ta me; I am going ta
be good ta it". That is the kind of thinking
we need in this country. It justifies the confidence of our people.
The late Senator Jones will be missed by
all the members of this house-personally, I
will miss him very much-and be will be
missed by the business men and women whom
be knew throughout Canada. His son and
daughter will miss him most of all; but they
may be happy in the thought that be made a
great contribution ta Canada. He contributed
largely ta the general goodwill, not only in
the Senate of Canada, but everywhere he
went; and we in this chamber will miss him
sorely. He left a great record not only in
this bouse but in the House of Commons and
in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick, and today we honour his service ta our
country. Sa I say "Good-bye, George; I know
you will be happy where you have gone; and
I will always remember how happy you were
here."
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
having been associated with Senator Jones
for many years, and as one of his colleagues
in parliament for twenty-five years, may I
join with the two leaders in paying tribute
ta his memory. Seldom are we called upon,
as we have been in the case of Senators
Antoine J. Leger and George B. Jones, ta
récord the death, within three weeks of
each other, of two members of this bouse,
who represented adjoining .constituencies in
their native province and occupied seats
together in this chamber.
Senator Jones lived ta a ripe old age and
enjoyed remarkably good health: he was
active until his final illness. He was born
of poor, honest parents in the province of
New Brunswick, and having had but a
common school education he had ta go ta
work when in his teens. A firrn believer

SENATE
in free enterprise, he decided that he would
enter business for himself. He was not one
of those who parade with placards on their
breasts and backs and carry a banner declaring that the world or the government owes
them a living. Rather, he relied on his own
efforts and his own industry.
When only twenty-one years of age he
started in business. He went into the lumber industry, built a mill, and eventually
opened a general store; and through his
close attention to business and his industry
and application he became one of the country's most successful business men.
He earned the confidence of the people
not only in his own locality but throughout
the province. That is demonstrated by the
fact that he was called to the directorate
of several very important corporations and,
as the leader has pointed out, acted for
nearly sixty years as chairman of the
board of school trustees in his own locality;
also by the fact that for forty-two years,
without suffering one defeat, he represented
his constituency in the Legislature of New
Brunswick, and, since 1921, in the federal
House of Commons, until his appointment
to this chamber in 1935.
He entered the Senate at the same time
I did. Nineteen of us took our seats on
the same day. We then numbered sixtynine; we filled one side of the bouse and
overflowed to the benches at the rear of the
opposite side. After a little over fourteen
years but thirteen of us are left. During
that period fifty-six on our side of the
house, as well as many on the government
side, have passed to the Great Beyond.
These events are a reminder of the uncertainty of this life and the short time allowed
to us on this earth. They make me sad
and remind me of the words of that beautiful poem "Oft in the Stilly Night" by the
immortal bard of Ireland, Thomas Moore:
When I remember ail
The friends, so link'd together,
Tve seen around me fail,
Like leaves in wintry weather,
I feel like one who treads alone
Some banquet-hall deserted,
Whose lights are fled, whose garlands dead,
And ail but he departed!
And so, honourable members, I lay my
wreath upon the grave of our late colleague,
George B. Jones, and I join with those
who have already spoken in extending my

sympathy to the ones he has left behind.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators, I
should like to add a word to what bas already
been so ably said in tribute to the memory
of the late senator from New Brunswick.
During a long association in our native

province of New Brunswick and in this chamber, I grew very fond of Senator Jones and
learned to admire his many fine qualities.
As the leader of the opposition has said,
Senator Jones will be greatly missed by his
colleagues in the Senate and the House of
Commons, and by his many associates here
in Ottawa. He will be missed by his business
acquaintances throughout New Brunswick
and elsewhere in Canada, but most of all he
will be missed by the people in the little
community of Apohaqui where he spent his
life and carved out a career which should be
an inspiration to the youth of Canada. I
join with the preceding speakers in extending
my sympathy to those whom he left behind.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt moved the second
reading of Bill B-5, an Act to incorporate the
Apostolic Trustees of the Friars Minor or
Franciscans.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill

to secure on a national scale the incorporation
of a body of trustees who heretofore, incorporated under a special Act of the legislature

of Quebec, passed in 1893 and amended in
1899 and 1936, have been administering the
material interests of the Franciscan Order.
Since its incorporation in Quebec, the Franciscan Order has founded several convents

and other establishments across Canada, as a
result of which it has been found advisable
that the trustees be accorded by parliament
the necessary incorporation and powers to
enable them to discharge in all ten provinces
the responsibility which heretofore they have

carried on under a Quebec statute. The provisions of this bill are identical with those of
bills of a like nature approved by parliament
in the past.
I am not very familiar with this order, but
I may say that the Franciscan Fathers are not
permitted to handle financial matters and
therefore trustees are appointed for this purpose. These trustees have the same powers
as do trustees for other organizations. Witnesses will be available for questioning when
the measure reaches committee, and a full
explanation of the bill can be obtained at
that time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills.

MAY 2, 1950
BUSINESS OF PARLIAMENT
SESSIONAL PROGRAM

Hon. W. McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before proceeding with the next
item on the Order Paper, I should like to
make a brief statement about the work of the
Senate generally. I have heard that there is
some question being raised as to why the
Senate should sit when there is a minimum
of work before the house itself. I may explain
that the purpose of having the house sit is
principally to facilitate the work of the
Senate committees, which, as honourable
senators know, is taxing the capacity of not
only our members but our reporting staff. If
we had more legislation before us we would
deal with it as usual, but I would remind the
house that the work of the Divorce Committee
and the Special Committee on Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms is making unusual demands on the members of our stenographic staff, and any lengthy -sittings of the
Senate at this time would place a very heavy
burden on them.
I am anxious that the Senate, by disposing
of its work at the earliest possible moment,
should in every way facilitate the House
of Commons in dealing with its tasks. I have
always felt that the public generally does
not appreciate the heavy work and responsibilities of both government members and
private members in another place. Their
daily routine is very strenuous. Members of
the government have to deal with departmental matters, correspondence, government meetings, committee meetings, and in addition
have to attend the long sessions of the House
of Commons itself, which carries on from
three o'clock in the afternoon until eleven
o'clock at night throughout the week, except
for Wednesday nights and Saturdays. Private members have their correspondence to
handle, and they must visit governmenit
departments in the interests of their constituents. Further, they have much committee
work to do and they have to attend long
sittings in the house itself.
Since the Senate must sooner or later pass
every bit of legislation which goes through
parliament, I have often felt that some further redistribution of responsibility as between
the two houses could be arranged so that the
very heavy work of the House of Commons
would be lessened. If a satisfactory redistribution could be arrived at, it would contribute greatly to the shortening of each
session of parliament. Such a program was
arranged some years ago when the Senate
assumed the major responsibility in the handling of divorce bills. In the meantime, all

we can do is to put our house in order, and
plan accordingly, to render our maximum
service.
I must say that I was disturbed to read in
the columns of a morning newspaper yesterday that the prevailing opinion in House of
Commons' circles is that parliament will not
prorogue until some time in July. It is difficult for me to believe that this would be
a pleasant prospect for anyone connected
with parliament, be he a member of the government, a private member or a departmental
official. Except for the intermission over
the Chrismas holiday season, parliament has
been in session more or less continuously
since last September.
Now I do not wish, and I do not think
anybody else wishes, to see any member
deprived of his or her traditional right to
consider matters which come before parliament, but I believe honourable senators will
agree with me when I say that, generally
speaking, the weather conditions in Ottawa in
the latter part of June and during July are
not such as to lend themselves to very efficient
work on the part of parliament.
Personally, I should like to see an arrangement whereby the work of the session would
be completed not later than the latter part
of June each year, and, if possible, by the
end of May; and I think that members of
parliament generally hold this view.
In order that we may make our maximum
contribution, I am going to ask the Senate to
sit from Monday through to Friday every
week, until at least the end of May. So far
this session we havé received from the House
of Commons seven bills, and have dealt with
them. We have forwarded to that house 139
bills, including divorce bills, and I hope that
any other legislation which comes before us
will be dealt with as speedily as is consistent with careful consideration, in order
that the House of Commons may have the
measures at as early a moment as possible.
I should like to suggest to the Divorce Committee that it consider completing its hearings not later than May 19, in order that the
bills resulting therefrom may be dealt with
and sent to the House of Commons not later
than the end of May. Also, if possible and
convenient, I should like to see the Special
Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the committees on the
estimates complete their investigations and
present their reports by the end of Mayalways provided, of course, that they are
able to complete their work within that time
to their satisfaction.
I am sure that the Senate would be prepared to assume any other responsibilities

SENATE
that might be practical, and if it were agreeable to the House of Commons, and feasible,
I would be happy to recommend that the
Senate participate in a joint conference with
that house to consider how the work of the
session could be expedited.
STANDING COMMITTEES-THEIR
CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTIONS
MOTION

The Senate resumed from Thursday, April
27, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robertson:
1. That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to review the Constitution and functions
of the Standing Committees of the Senate and to
make such recommendations to facilitate the business of the Senate as it may deem necessary or
expedient.
2. That the said Committee be composed of the
Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beaubien, Bouffard,
Burchill, Farris, Fogo, Haig, Hayden, Hugessen,
Lambert, Moraud, Robertson.

Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
propose to speak only briefly to this motion
that was moved by the le'fder of the government on April 27. The senators whom he
nominated would, I am sure, constitute an
excellent committee, and one fairly representative of the members of this house. However, I am going to suggest to the leader that
he add to the committee two and possibly
three of the most recent appointees to the
Senate whô were formerly members of the
House of Commons. I believe their addition
to the committee would bring to it a reflection of the feeling of the House of Commons
towards this chamber. I would not press my
suggestion, but I believe that if it were carried out it would work to the committee's
advantage.
I think the leader of the government is to
be commended upon his desire to facilitate
the organization and work of our committees,
so that we may find useful employment at
certain periods of the parliamentary session
when otherwise there would not be much for
us to do. He has suggested that the Divorce
Committee should begin its work each session
almost immediately after the opening of
parliament. I can see no objection to that
and I think it could be easily arranged. I
believe there has been a growing feeling that
to be a member of the Divorce Committee is
rather infra dig. That should not be so. At
the time of Confederation jurisdiction in marriage and divorce was assigned to the federal
parliament, and the hearing of divorce applications was a duty assumed by the Senate,
in accordance with the practice in Britain,
where this subject is considered by the House
of Lords. I think it is to the credit of the
Senate, and of parliament as a whole, that
although a very large number of divorce cases

have been dealt with here in the last eightythree years, nothing has occurred in connection with them to defame or lower the status
of our committee. That committee in the past
was considered so important that it was presided over by some of the most prominent
members of the Senate, including Mr. Ross,
an able lawyer from Halifax, and Sir James
Lougheed, of Calgary, another able lawyer.
The Honourable Mr. Willoughby, of Moose
Jaw, who was leading this house when I
entered it in 1930, was also for some years
chairman of the Divorce Committee. Later on
I became a member of the committee and
served on it for some eight or nine years. I
took on the work in succession to the late Dr.
Rankin, at the request of the then leader of
the Senate, the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen, who represented to me that the
committee needed a member with medical
experience. Mr. Meighen put the matter to
me in a very tactful way. He said, "King, I
know you are too young for the work, but
will you act on that committee?"
In the Divorce Committee three members
are a quorum. If a large committee were
appointed-and there is no reason why this
should not be done-the members could
arrange among themselves to distribute the
sittings so that the hearings could continue
even if the Senate were adjourned over the
slack period that usually intervenes between
the debate on the Speech from the Throne
and the bringing down of legislation in the
House of Commons. I do not see why there
should be any difficulty about this. After all,
members of this house are appointed to serve
under the constitution and to perform the
duties devolving upon them by reason of their
appointment. No hardship would be caused
to honourable senators by continued sittings
of the committee during a relatively short
period while the Senate itself was adjourned,
and I quite agree with the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) that the committee
should start its work almost immediately
after the opening of parliament, and continue
from day to day until its business for the
session is disposed of.
Over the course of time various provinces
have established their own divorce courts, but
if I read the constitution aright any citizen
of Canada has the privilege of filing petition
for divorce with parliament. It might be
that the Senate would say, "We will not hear
your petition because you have the right to
go to a court within your own province."
Nevertheless, I think every citizen has the
right to file a petition for divorce with the
federal parliament in Ottawa.
Let us not worry too much about this question, for no government in Canada would
undertake to force any province to establish

MAY 2, 1950

similar to that of my good friend the present against action on our part to bring before our

SENATE
committees ministers or deputy ministers to
tell us in advance what should first be communicated to the elected chamber.
As we all know, money bills can be introduced into the House of Commons only by a
minister and with the consent of His Excellency the Governor General. And there is
one bill, the supply bill, which has precedence
over all others. It comes in at the front door;
it is presented by the Speaker of the House
of Commons, the elected house; it is taken
from him and becomes the first consideration
of members of the elected chamber of this
parliament. We should, I think, keep that
fact in mind; and I hope it will have the careful attention of the committee which is to be
set up. After all, the amenities that must
exist between the two branches of parliament
are of great importance. If we are to perform
the duties which are expected of us as a parliament, there should be the closest relationship possible between the two branches. I
had occasion to look up the deflnition of the
word "amenities". It is most interesting and
has a very broad application. Let me read
some of the meanings that are given:
affability,
agreeableness,
"pleasantness,
amiability, blandness, graciousness, obliging
manner, good manners and good breeding".
Is it not the desire of every member of this
senate that we, individually and as a group,
have these qualities? Is it not desirable that
we of this chamber should maintain these
qualifications?
I have mentioned the committee under the
chairmanship of Mr. Ross which considered
the matter of expenditures. I feel very
strongly on this matter. I realize, of course,
that the leader, in proceeding as he has done
this year, must have had the consent and the
opinion of Council; but he is moving on the
assumption that the estimates will be presented next year as early as they were this
year. I have great doubt that that will occur.
I know something about the preparation of
estimates, what it means. Estimates are the
things that bring men to the elected chamber
of parliament, where they are enabled to
make representations to the government, to
the ministers and to the officers of various
departments as to their requirements and
those of their constituents. It is true, because
the house prorogued in April and a general
election intervened between sessions, that at
the earlier session the full amount of the
estimates for the year was not voted, but
only sufficient for requirements until the end
of September. Therefore it was necessary
for us to meet later to pass the estimates for
the balance of the year.

The completion of

the budget was also withheld. When we came

proceeded with and concluded. But in that
period we had a new parliament: about one
hundred new members were elected to the
House of Commons. Before this session
opened they had the opportunity of going to
the ministers and various officials and of
explaining their requirements, and that, in
my opinion, was the reason why the estimates were presented early this year.
I cannot believe that it is the intention of
the government, or, if it were, that the
Liberal party would acquiesce in it, to
declare on the first or second day or in the
first week of the session, "These are the estimates we place before you, and these are the
That is not
estimates you will accept."
Liberalism, nor is it a practice which will be
continued in this parliament. The elected
representatives will always have the right
to go to the various departments of government and explain their requirements; and
when J say that I do not mean only the
supporters of the government, but every
member of parliament. From my own experience I can say that nothing pleased me more
than to have a member of the opposition
come and discuss with me the requirements
of his district. The suggestions of the members making representations were noted, and
if they were considered to be worthy and
advisable and practicable, provision for them
was included in the estimates, the items went
to Council and were discussed there, and
from there passed to the Treasury Board, and
those that got through, got through. My point
is that, if we are to have responsible government, those who are elected to the other
chamber must have the right and the opportunity to do those things which they think
necessary in the interests of their constituencies.
I would not hope that committee work
would continue on the lines which were followed this year. The honourable senator
from Wellington South (Hon. Mr. Gladstone>
pretty well exposed the situation the other
day. From experience this year with his
committee he had this to say:
Relative to the work of the Committee on Estimates: one committee on which I have the honour
to serve was att'ended by some six or eight senators;
attended; questions were
departmental officiais
asked and some valuable information was elicited.
But no record was kept. The information contained
in the answers could in no way come to the knowledge of other honourable senators; neither could
the questions and answers be known to the elected
representatives of the people in the other place. I
am just wondering what is the value of ,carrying
on in this way.

I think experience will show that we are
out of step when we undertake to summon

MAY 2, 1950
ministers to the Senate to explain the estimates before they are explained in the House
of Commons, where the elected members have
the primary interest in them.
The honourable leader has also said that
it is his purpose to make definite proposals
for Senate reform, on his own responsibility
as Senate leader. Well, if there is to be
cohesion and unanimity in government circles, ministers should not declare their own
personal views, especially on matters of such
magnitude as the reform of the Senate.
Surely if we are to get leadership and advice
from those who are really the elected representatives of the people of Canada, the information must come from a minister of the
government who can say that he is speaking
for the government and not just for himself.
I have high regard for my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson). He is a clear
thinker and expresses himself well; but I
would suggest to him that he hesitate to make
such a declaration in this chamber, because
if he does, my reaction will be that he is
"flying a kite"-you all know what that
means-and I do not believe that he would
lend himself to that.
The matter of Senate reform will shortly
come to the fore, and I am doubtful if any
minister or officer of the government will
state his personal views about it, at least
not until the meeting between the dominion
and provincial governments in September.
I have no doubt that this question will be
thoroughly canvassed at that time, and perhaps something will come out of it all. We
know what happened at the conference in
1928 when the provinces refused to take any
action or make any suggestions about the
reform of the Senate. The question is more
pressing today, and representations about the
constitution of the Senate will probably be
made during the next dominion-provincial
conference, and we may find that suggestions
will be made for reforming the membership of
this chamber and the method by which persons shall become members of it, but I doubt
that the powers of the Senate will be greatly
increased.
Honourable senators, I may have spoken
too long, but I wanted to say a few words
about this subject. What I have said has been
said with a feeling of the greatest kindness
and with no intention of offending anyone.
I believe that we have a real problem to
consider, and I do hope the committee which
is to handle this matter will remember what
I have said about amenities. The two houses
of parliament must, if they are to fulfil their
functions, move along from day to day with
a vdew to carrying out the duties that have
been prescribed to them by our constitution.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
appears to me that one point in this resolution requires clarification, and perhaps the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who
presented it, can enlighten us. The operative
part of the resolution is:
That a special committee of the Senate be
appointed to review the constitution and functions
of the standing committees of the Senate and to
make such recommendations to facilitate the business of the Senate as it may deem necessary or
expedient.

I think there would be a clearer understanding if it read "to facilitate the business
of the committees", instead of "to facilitate
the business of the Senate". As it reads now
it appears that two responsibilities are placed
upon the eminent gentlemen named to the
committee: first, to review the constitution
and functions of the standing committees of
the Senate and, secondly, to make such recommendations to facilitate the business of the
Senate as it may deem necessary or expedient. Here the words "business of the Senate" mean business of the Senate apart from
the work of the standing committees. I do
not know that this is what my honourable
friend had in mind when he presented his
resolution, and perhaps it would be useful
to have this point clarified.
I should like now to comment on the
remarks just made by the honourable senator
from East Kootenay (Hon. Mr. King). I am
not sure that I agree with the view he
apparently holds, that it is not the function
of the members of this house to examine
estimates.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He does not say that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Perhaps I am not inter.
preting his remarks correctly or fully; but
my understanding of what my friend said
was that we should not ask ministers or their
deputies to appear before committees of the
Senate to explain estimates before they are
explained in the other house.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is different.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As a matter of fact, if we
were to adopt this practice it would mean
that we would scarcely ever be able to consider the estimates for the simple reason
that the Supply Bill, which covers all the
estimates of the various departments, usually
comes to us at the very end of the session.
Under such procedure, therefore, it would
be impossible for this house to give any
consideration to the estimates in the main
bluebook, which this year totalled $2 billion
308 million. I would remind honourable
members that when the estimates are submitted by the government they are not just
This

SENATE

house is just as much a part of parliament
as is the other house, and consequently the
leader of the government in the Senate formally places the estimates before us every
session by tabling them, as he invariably
does, when they are tabled in the House of
Commons.
It may be a nice question how far the
Senate, being a non-elective house, has the
power or the right to inquire into the amounts
of money asked for by the government for
administrative purposes. Personally, I very
strongly hold the view that the responsibility
of senators in this respect, although we are
appointed rather than elected members of
parliament, is just as continuing and just
as important as is that of members of the
Commons. To anyone who accepts that view
it follows logically that we are quite within
our right in examining the proposals that the
government submits to parliament-bear in
mind, not to the House of Commons alone,
but to parliament-for the expenditure of
public moneys raised through the ordinary
processes of revenue. Holding that view,
I am bound to say that I find myself in some
disagreement with my good and highly
esteemed colleague from Kootenay, East
(Hon. Mr. King).
Judged by the results that might come
from it, I think the current examination by
Senate committees is of value. If there is
one thing that characterizes our public life
today, it is the hazy and indefinite idea that
the public in general has about public expenditures.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That accounts for the
frequent and perfectly ludicrous situation
wherein a delegation appearing before the
government or a minister advocates, in one
breath, reduced taxes and, in the next breath,
increased expenditures for this, that, or the
other thing.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is the new philosophy.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It appears to me, at any
rate, as our evidence of a certain confusion
in the public mind. A lot of people these
days seem to have the idea that governments
get their money in some mysterious fashion,
quite apart from payments by individual
taxpayers. The point I am trying to make
is that the more attention we give to these
expenditures and the more light we throw
upon them, the more intelligent will public
opinion about them become, and to my mind
that is a valuable service which our committees will render through their current
examination of estimates.

I do not think it derogates from the dignity
of a minister or a deputy minister or departmental official to be asked to appear before
a Senate committee and explain what is
proposed to be done with the money asked
for, and to enlighten us as to why certain
votes are needed. The asking for such information by this branch of parliament is
no reflection on the government or on any
minister, deputy minister or other official.
Consequently I disagree with my honourable friend on that point. Frequently since
I have been a member of this house we have
had ministers explain their bills to some of
our committees. That practice did not detract
at all from the dignity or standing of the
ministers concerned, and it gave this branch
of parliament useful information which was
necessary to enable us to discharge properly
and adequately the functions that the constitution places upon us and that the people
expect of us.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I would not have intervened in this discussion had it not been for the most interesting speech which we heard a few minutes ago
from our distinguished colleague from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King). I have
the most profound respect for my honourable
friend, and his views are entitled to a great
deal of consideration because of his long
experience as a member of the other house
as a Minister of the Crown and as a member
who has held the most distinguished offices
in our own chamber. I must say, however,
that in this particular instance I ask the
liberty to disagree with some of the views
that he has expressed.
However, right at the beginning let me
say that I agree with him, and I think we
in the Senate must all agree that the primary
responsibility for the raising and the expenditure of public moneys does reside in
the elected chamber. It would be most unfortunate if the Senate were to do anything
which would give the other house the idea
that we were in any way attempting to
trench upon its well-known and fully
recognized constitutional prerogative in that
respect.
But the proposal made by our honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) which has been
carried out this session by the various standing committees that have been examining the
estimates, does not to my mind partake in
any way of an infringement upon the prerogative of the other house. Rather, I would
try to put the matter in another way. I
should think that in making his proposal,
which has been carried out this session, my
honourable friend had two distinct objects
in mind. The first was that by having our
standing committees conduct a study of the

MAY 2, 1950
estimates-which, as was pointed out by my
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), are placed before parliament and
not only before one house-we are in a
position to inform ourselves as to the details
of public expenditures and the general public
administration of the country. That, I say,
was the first object which I think my honourable friend had in mind; that as members of
a legislative branch of the parliament of
Canada we should be in a position to have
the fullest information about public moneys
and their expenditure.
My honourable friend from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) told us a good deal about
the amenities which should exist between
the two chambers. On this point also I
thoroughly agree with him; but I think that
the second object which the leader had in
making his proposal is thoroughly consistent
with it. I think that what he had in mind
was an endeavour to assist the other place
in the overwhelming amount of work which
devolves upon it during the course of a
session, with the result that under normal
circumstances huge estimates involving the
expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars cannot be considered until the very end
of the session. It seems to me that without
derogating in any way- from the prerogatives
of the other bouse, the advantage of the practice adopted this year is to relieve the other
chamber to some extent of the necessity of
conducting a detailed inquiry into some of
these estimates at the end of the session,
when there is not time to do so properly.
I think, perhaps, there is a third advantage
from the procedure to which I have referred.
Honourable senators know that what happens in the other place is that the minister
responsible for the particular department
whose estimates are under discussion has his
deputy sitting in front of him, and the minister himself gives the answers to such
questions as may be asked of him after a
momentary whispered conversation with the
deputy minister. That, honourable senators
is the way, year after year, in which the
various departments are enabled to tell the
public their stories about what they are doing
and what their proposals are for the future.
It seems to me that in adopting the system of
having standing committees of the Senate
summon deputy ministers before them to give
an intelligent statement of what their department is doing, how it works, and what its
hopes and ambitions are, we are doing a service not only to ourselves but to the departments, to the deputy ministers and to the
public of Canada. As my honourable friend
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has aptly
remarked, the more the public of Canada

235

knows about the method by which the administration of this country is being carried on,
the better it will be for the country and for
democracy in general.
I feel, therefore, that I must disagree with
my honourable friend from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King). It seems to me that in the
past there has been a gap in what one might
call the relationship between the departments
of government and the public, resulting, as
I have said, from the extreme pressure of
time under which the other place finds itself
at the end of the session. The fact that that
is so is surely clear from the debates which

have been going on in the other place during
the last few days. All the suggestions that
are being made about having an estimates
committee in the other place result from
the gap which now exists. I submit that the
suggestion of my honourable friend the leader
of the government, which has been carried
out this year, was merely an attempt in the
most friendly way to help the other place to
bridge that gap.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Before the honourable
senator sits down, I should like to put a
question to him. There seems to be a general
impression on the part of people everywhere
that the primary function of the Senate is
to review the work of the House of Commons before it is finally adopted. If that
be so, would there not be a conflict to some
extent by reason of our investigating the
estimates before they have been dealt with
by the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, as the honourable
senator from Churchill said, and as I also have
said, once the estimates are brought down
they are before both branches of parliament,
and technically there is nothing to prevent
either branch from considering them.
Hon. Mr. Howden: But they have not yet
been dealt with or considered by the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Davies: May I ask a question of
the honourable deputy leader concerning the
committees on estimates? After sitting for
some time and hearing explanations by deputy
ministers, would the committees have power
to do anything? If they did not agree with
certain estimates, could they reduce them?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Technically speaking,
a committee could reduce estimates. I think,
however, the advantage lies in the publicity
which would attend a deputy minister appearing before one of our committees and
explaining the work of his department. And
mark you, honourable senators, deputy ministers and officials of departments, knowing
that from now on, they may be called upon

SENATE
personally to explain any items, will all be
more careful to see that the items they submit are completely justified.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: The minister is responsible
for the estimates, not his deputy.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
the power of the Senate to review financial
matters and amend money bills has been discussed for a long time, and has been the subject of an elaborate report by most eminent
counsel. It is hardly debatable any longer.
Under the provisions of section 18 of the
British North America Act, the Senate has
all the powers which the House of Commons
in England possessed at the time of confederation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Read the section.
Hon. Mr. Vien: It reads as follows:

that has not been first recommended to that House
by message of the Governor General in the session
in which such vote, resolution, address, or bill is
proposed.

years. The findings of these eminent Counsel
are contrary to the view generally but wrongly
held that we cannot amend a money bill.
Our powers with respect to all bills are not
those of the House of Lords, but those possessed by the House of Commons in England
at the time of confederation. There is in the
B.N.A. Act a limitation in the matter of parliamentary procedure, namely with respect to
the introduction of money bills. Section 53
of the British North America Act reads:

moneys voted by parliament are being spent,

As you see, that limitation affects both the
House of Commons and the Senate, and does
not refer to the amount involved in a money
bill, but only to the "purpose" of such a bill
which must have been recommended by message of the Governor General.
It has never been suggested that we have
not power to investigate.
We can at any
time create select special committees of
investigation. The estimates are laid on the
table of the House of Commons and of the
Senate, usually at the beginning of the session
or a few weeks thereafter. They are not in
the form of a bill They are tabled as a bluebook, and later are submitted and considered
as resolutions. When these resolutions are
adopted, a bill of supply, and a bill of ways

and effective way of dealing with this matter
This question has been clearly analyzed would be to lay on the table of the Senate,
and set out in a report made by Mr. Eugene early in the session, the report of the AuditorLafleur, Aimé Geoffrion and another counsel. General and the estimates and then to conThat report, which was referred to a minute stitute a committee of the Senate to which

Bills for appropriating any part of the public
revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost, shall
originate in the House of Commons.
Money bills must originate in the House of
Commons, but once introduced there, the
powers of the Senate with respect to such
bills are not limited; they remain as set out
in Section 18 of our constitution.
I am not unmindful of Section 54 of the
British North America Act, which limits the
powers of the House of Commons as well as
those of the Senate. It reads:
It shall not be lawful for the House of Commons

to adopt or pass any vote, resolution, address, or
bill for the appropriation of any part of the public
revenue, or of any tax or impost, to any purpose

let us study the report of the Auditor-General;
let us find out how the moneys voted in previous years have been used.
I speak extemporaneously, and I do not
want to take too much of the time of the
house; but it would seem to me that it is the
duty of not only a small committee of twelve
drawn from the membership of the Senate,
but of all honourable members, to give proper
consideration to the estimates and the
expenditures of public money. I therefore
suggest that we should adopt the practice

followed in the House of Commons, where the
estimates and the budget are studied in Committee of the Whole and all members par-

ticipate.

I do not see why that could not be

done as easily in the Senate as it is in the

other house.

If that is not considered desir-

able, let us constitute a standing committee
on the budget, composed of all the members
of the Senate. Such a committee should hold
its sittings in a large room where all senators
could attend, or, indeed, in the Senate

MAY 2, 1950
cnamber, if necessary. Ail honourable senators would then have full opportunity to discharge their responsibilities.
This year
certain items of the estimates have been
referred to the Committee on Public Health
and Welfare, others to the Committee on
Tourist Traffic, others to the Committee on
External Relations, and so on. Many honourable senators who are not members of such
committees would like to know what is going
on there, but are unable to do so.
I would like also to suggest that ail committees of the Senate should receive the power
to order that their proceedings be taken in
shorthand and printed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In the other place, the
estimates being studied by the Committee of
the Whole, the proceedings are reported
verbatim in Hansard. If it is deemed advisable to proceed otherwise here, at least let
us see to it that our proceedings are taken in
shorthand and printed for distribution to ail
members of the Senate.
Among the reasons urged by the honourable
the leader of the government in support of
his motion, was the fact that it takes a long
time to organize the Senate for business at
the beginning of each session. May I submit
to him that on the day of the opening, after
we have met to receive new members, which
is usually at eleven o'clock in the morningand before we adjourn during pleasure, we
should proceed to constitute the committee
which is to select the members of our various
committees; and instead of adjourning on the
first day of the session, we should sit on the
following day, receive the report of the committee which has selected the personnel of
our committees, adopt the report, and immediately organize these committees.
We
already possess ahl the machinery necessary
for this purpose, and we have only to use it.
My honourable leader has made several
other extraordinary remarks. I agree with
the honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) that the leader of this house,
being a minister of the Crown, cannot overlook or forget the princigle of ministerial
solidarity. This is sound constitutional principle and practice. That reminds me of a
suggestion once made by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) that no minister of the Crown
should sit in this house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With the exception of
the leader.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Well, I thought the honourable member had made no exception. The
leader of this house might very well be only
55950-17

a liaison officer between the Senate and the
government: then, but then only, could he
speak as the honourable gentleman did the
other evening. So long as there is ministerial
solidarity, no minister of the Crown can speak
on a question of policy without committing
the cabinet as a whole. On that question I
share the view expressed by the honourable
senator from Kootenay East.
Our honourable leader also spoke of the
desirability of reforming the Senate. I would
suggest that we should not be in such a rush
to commit suicide. The Senate is serving a
very good purpose. This upper house was
created at the time of conferation, to be a
chamber of second thought on legislation, to
review legislation which might at times be
too hastily passed by the House of Commons,
or at other times be inspired by erratic currents of public opinion. This house, intended
and supposed to be composed of experienced
legislators, should review and, as the occasion arises, amend the legislation passed in
the other place.
The Senate was also created to protect
the autonomy of the provinces and the rights
and privileges of minorities. Let us be
thankful that in Canada occasion has seldom
arisen when the Senate has been called upon
to exercise that power. But is it not wise and
prudent to maintain in the parliament of
Canada a second chamber whose duty it is to
protect the autonomy of the provinces and
the privileges and right of minorities? If, in
the future, after a general election, as a result
of a temporary stampede a radical party were
to be empowered to form an administration
and were to attempt to enact subversive
legi lation, the Senate should be there to aot
as a safey valve.
B» Ihat as it may, in my opinion, the
Senate fulfils a good purpose in reviewing
the iegislation that comes to us from the
House of Commons and in handling legislation which ori;inates here. The true value
of insiiutions can best be ascertained and
judged by the results obtained in actual performance. The Parliament of Canada was
created with a Senate and a House of Commons, under the British North America Act,
in 1367. How has it worked during these
eighty-three years? Has not Canada during
that period grown up and 'advanced by leaps
and bounds among the nations of the world?
What were we in 1867? What were we even
at the turn of the century? Have we not now
progressed far beyond the most sanguine
expectations of the Fathers of Confederation?
Our accomplishments under the British
North America Act have proven the value of
this marvellous constitutional instrument. I
know that certain isolated groups may

SENATE
deplore, and do deplore, certain constitutional guarantees and the degree of freedom
left to local governments. I for one thank
God for these things. But even this feature
does not indicate a lack of power or of
efficiency in our constitutional instrument.
It is additional evidence of the ability of
Canadians to govern themselves wisely. Let
us be as patriotically-minded as were our
predecessors; let us beware of saboteurs; let
us use prudently the legislative and administrative powers handed down to us from
generation to generation. Let us protect and
safeguard the institutions so wisely conceived
by our forebears, which have enabled Canada
to make such remarkable progress since confederation.

it was suggested that manufacturers be prohibited from enclosing little packages of
colouring matter with their margarine. And
at a meeting of the Dairy Council of Canada
held in the province of Quebec a week or
two ago, a certain Montreal gentleman, who
I believe is head of a dairy concern there,
declared that the sales tax on margarine
ought to be increased to 15 per cent. A good
deal of the time of that convention was
devoted to complaints about the perilous
position of dairymen, but when I noticed that
the gathering was held at the very swank
and expensive club known as the Seigniory
Club, my fears that those gentlemen were
on the brink of ruin were dispelled. Perhaps
the dairymen decided to meet at that club
because, as they were in the province of
Quebec, they knew they would not be served
with margarine in any event.
When my bill was under discussion in this
chamber a prediction was made- that even
if the bill were passed no margarine could
be placed on the market until at .least three
years later, but in fact it was only three
weeks after the Supreme Court declared our
prohibitory law to be invalid that margarine
was placed on the market-and it was the
coloured product. At the time of the
Supreme Court's declaration the then Premier of Ontario, who was also Minister of
Agriculture-which office he still holdsresisted attempts of the pressure group to
prevent the colouring of margarine, but the
group was pretty strong and eventually
Ontario enacted a law which practically forbids colouring. Although I am not much of
a politician, I noticed that this measure was
supported by not only every Conservative
member in the legislature, but by every
Liberal and every C.C.F. member, the only
votes against the ban on colouring having
been those of the two Communist members.
Unfortunately the example set by Ontario
was followed by every other province except
Quebec and Prince Edward Island. To my
suprise, a week or two ago the Minister of
Agriculture in Prince Edward Island announced that at the coming session of the
legislature a bill would be.presented to legalize the manufacture and sale of margarine.
Thus, Quebec will have what I should regard
as the very doubtful distinction of being the
only province in Canada which deprives its
people of this nutritious and inexpensive food,
margarine. I should qualify that statement
a bit, for I arn very credibly informed that
many people in western Quebec do get a
good deal of margarine, which they bring
across the provincial boundary from Ontario,
and I an sure that people in the eastern part
>f the province also have the benefit of con.siderable quantities of margarine.

To me the amazing thing about the whole
situation is that the political influence-I use
these words advisedly-the political influence
of this dairy pressure group is extravagently
disproportionate to the group's political
strength. And what has all this opposition to
margarine accomplished for the producers of
butter? True, a ban has been placed on the
colouring of margarine. The sole purpose of
this ban was to discourage housewives from
buying margarine, which when not coloured
is pale white in appearance, but this purpose
has not yet been achieved. Housewives are
buying margarine in spite of the ban on
colouring, and the only things being accomplished by the ill-advisei opponents of margarine are these:
1. They are imposing an additional bit of
drudgery upon the busy housewife by compelling lier, if she wants coloured margarine,
to colour it in her own kitchen.
2. They are creating ill will for themselves
by their selfish demands.
3. By their constant opposition they are
advertising margarine from coast to coast,
and have done so all along.
I would suggest to these opponents of
margarine that, instead of complaining, they
should:
1. Accept fair competition, as does everyone
else who believes in individual enterprise.
2. Advertise their own product instead of
depreciating the product of their competitors.
3. Become a little more efficient in the production of butter.
On the need for more efficiency by dairymen
I would quote from a newspaper report of an
address by Professor R. G. Knox, head of
the Animal Husbandry Department at the
Ontario Agricultural College.
The report
says:
He drove home the need for increased efficiency
last week when the Junior Farmers' Association was
meeting at the college.
He could have picked
no better audience. If young farmers get the idea
and put it to work, there should be no need for
similar lectures a couple of decades from now.

And listen to this:
Professor Knox said that average production per
dairy cow per acre in Ontario is under 5,000 pounds.
In other progressive dairy countries the total runs
from 8,000 to 10,00a pounds.

In the United States the federal sales tax
on margarine was completely removed, but
opponents of the law prohibiting the colouring of margarine have had to fight the same
battle as is going on in Canada. They are
steadily winning the battle, as I am perfectly
confident we shall here, in time. In thirtytwo of the American states there is no longer
any ban against colouring, the ban in nine
of those states having been removed within
the last two years.

SENATE

Although dairy organizations and other
groups claim that farmers generally are
opposed to margarine, I am quite certain
that this is not the fact. In my own district
I get around among the farmers, many of
whom run dairy farms, and I have not heard
a word of complaint from them. I have also
consulted the managers of grocery and other
stores in the district and they tell me that
farmers themselves buy margarine.
A person unknown to me sent me a copy of
a Western newspaper, the Yorktown Enterprise, containing a marked paragraph, which
I think would be appreciated by my good
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
if he were present this afternoon. The paragraph reads:
The champions of farmers' causes in parliament
will feel somewhat deflated when they read the
results of a survey in Yorkton covering the use of
margarine. This uncovered the fact that farmers
themselves buy more margarine than butter and
are using their cream cheques for the purpose.
Grocers report that the average sale to the rural
trade is four to six pounds per week. The explanation is not far to seek. Margarine sells at from
34 cents to 42 cents per pound as against 61 cents
and 62 cents for butter. Farmers' butter fat brings
them 57 cents per pound at the creameries. On the
whole local farmers do not seem unduly perturbed
over the margarine situation. For years past they
have been buying their butter from Yorkton stores
and selling their cream to the creameries. They
find they can save money by substituting margarine
and that is just what they are doing.

indeed a striking verdict from the nation's No. 6
dairy state, but most meaningful were the returns
from its agricultural counties.
It was to be expected that yellow margarine would
carry the metropolitan areas, as it did: 4 to 1 in
Cincinnati, approximately 3 to 1 in Cleveland and
Columbus, 2 to 1 in Dayton, Akron and Toledo, and
4 to 3 in Canton. But it also carried 24 of the
Buckeye state's most highly agriculturalized counties, "14 of which derive more income from dairy
products than from any other farm crop and in
eight of which dairying is the second most important source of farm income." The digest of the
complete returns, just made public, adds that margarine was given a majority in 13 other counties
which look to dairying for a large part of their
farm income and none of which includes a big city.
This record is a resounding answer to the pretension of the butter lobby that the repeal of taxes
and restrictions on margarine would be a deadly
blow to the country's dairying interests. When
the sixth most important dairy state votes overwhelmingly to abolish such discrimination, the
ballyhoo of the butter magnates no longer can be
taken seriously.
Ohio's fight for a free market was launched by
32,000 housewives.

I may say that I have read a good deal
about this question, and I know that the
housewives of that State fought very hard
to get the legislature to move in the matter
of the colouring of margarine, and they were
getting nowhere; but at last a fight for a
free market was launched by 32,000 housewives, and their petitions for a referendum
were signed by 426,000 qualified voters.

that some defence ought to be made on

for my remarks at this time.
In conclusion, I express the modest hope
that my motion will be accepted by the
house, for the reasons which I shall enumerate. First, margarine is entitled to the same
exemption from sales tax as all other foods.
I think there can be no reasonable objection
to that proposal. Second, if the government
would accept the motion and act accordingly,
it would help to reduce the cost of living
for many people who are badly in need of
assistance. Third, it would remove the discrimination of denying to the consumers of

absolutely unanswerable, and I am quite
sure that honourable senators from - Newfoundland would not object to the removal
of the discrimination. Fourth, I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of
the people of Canada are in favour of the
removal of the tax; and they are entitled
to those benefits that would flow from such
removal.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. James P. McIntyre: Honourable
senators, I do not intend to participate in
this debate, but I wish to correct a statement
made in the course of the remarks of the
honourable senator from Waterloo. I recall
that when the honourable senator first introduced his bill to amend the Dairy Industry
Act, three or four years ago, it was defeated.
But that did not discourage him, and he
reintroduced it a second and a third time;
and on each occasion it failed to pass.
Later he had the pleasure of hearing the
Supreme Court of Canada proclaim that it
was lawful to manufacture and sell margarine
in Canada. This afternoon he stated, perhaps unintentionally, that the Minister of
Agriculture of Prince Edward Island had
introduced in the legislatureHon. Mr. Euler: Excuse me, but I did not
say that. I said the minister had made a
declaration that margarine was going ito be
made legal.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: But that is not the case.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I did not say that he
had introduced a bill.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: But there was a bill
introduced in the legislature to make the
ban on margarine coming into that province
more stringent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Well, it was to come into
the province.

Hon. Mr. McIn±yre: No; it cannot come into
the province. The bill has not been proclaimed, and it will not be proclaimed until
the Privy Council renders its decision which,
I understand, will be in June.
As honourable senators know, Prince
Edward Island is an agricultural province.
I fought the Dairy Industry Bill every time
my honourable friend brought it before the
house, and I am still of the opinion that
margarine is injurious to the agricultural
industry of the Dominion of Canada, and
particularly to that of Prince Edward Island.
My honourable friend is looking to the welfare of the consuming public in the larger
centres in Canada, and I do not blame
him for doing so, but it could be sold at a
lower price. I feel that the removal of
the sales tax of 8 per cent on margarine
would be injurious to the agricultural interests of this country, and particularly to
those of Prince Edward Island.
Hon. S. S. McKeen: I want to compliment
our honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) on his persistency.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that all?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: On the several previous
occasions when he brought forward the subject of margarine he made no mention of any
proposal to redice the tax on this article: all
he wanted was to get consent to its production
and sale. Now that, through a judgment of
the Supreme Court, the law prohibiting margarine has been declared illegal, he wants to
colour margarine and remove the sales tax.
I do not know that next session he will not
press for a further reduction of the tax:
perhaps he will ask for a bonus or a subsidy.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No. That is only applied
on butter.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It is not within the
power of the Senate to remove the tax,
because the effect would be to reduce the
revenues of the Crown: therefore the honourable senator puts his motion in the form
of a recommendation that the tax on margarine should be removed. Taxes, of course,
are obnoxious to everyone; but I am just
wondering whether, if we are to reduce taxes,
margarine is the item to begin with. I know
lots of other products which are now .taxed
and which could be exempted with greater
justice. As the honourable senator says,
margarine is a very cheap food, and it is
custornary to put taxes on commodities which
can best absorb them or where the people
can best afford to pay them. So as this is a
very cheap food, it would seem to be one of
those cases where the tax might stand.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How about ice cream?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I am not arguing in
favour of taxes; I am considering what position we are in when it is proposed to remove
a tax from this or that article. Take the
case of our newspapers. They are subject to
an impost of 8 per cent, yet they must cornpete with United States newspapers which
come into Canada, with a certain other class
of newspapers in this country which are
exempt, and with magazines that are largely
competitive with newspapers. The effect is to
hamper news distribution and increase publishing costs; and I suggest, that if we are to
remove any taxes, a beginning might well
be made in this field. However, I do not
intend to go into the subject generally: all
I urge is that the removal of the tax on this
particular item before the whole feld has
been explored is the wrong way to go about
reducing taxes. The matter is one which
should be carefully considered from all angles,
not merely from the standpoint of producers
and users of margarine, because the revenue
derived from the tax is needed, and if it
cannot be raised from margarine it must be
obtaineld somewhere else. Perhaps my honourable friend will argue that the tax should
be transferred from margarine to butter: I
do not know.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No, no.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The money must be
secured somewhere. So I repeat that we
should go very slowly in this matter, and I
for one would be loath to support the removal
of this tax until we have considered the whole
taxation picture.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I would like to add a few words to the
debate on this motion, words of disapproval
and of regret that the senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) should have seen fit to
launch this discussion in this house.
My views on the subject of margarine are
as well known as those of the senator from
Waterloo.
I have never believed that margarine was
not a healthful food. It is therefore not from
that angle that I will consider the problem,
but rather from the economic point of view.
When one speaks of the consumer, when one
wishes to safeguard the consumer, one must
also take the producer into consideration. It
matters little whether or not we are consumers. If you stop the producer from producing you will have nothing to eat. Well,
the first citizen who deserves protection in
this country is the farrner, who raises the
wheat and provides us with our daily bread.
If you destroy the producer, if you prevent
him from making a living, everybody, the
tvhole country will suffer.

Well and good to claim that such and such
action is being taken in the United States or
elsewhere. Those countries enjoy a climate
unlike our own. In Georgia, for instance,
and in the other southern states, the herds
are kept out the whole year round. Conditions are altogether different in Canada,
where our people have only six months during
which they can produce. And that is not all.
I will endeavour to refute one by one the
arguments put forward by my colleague. In
order to live and prosper, a country must
pro'ect itself against the competition of foreign products.
What would happen, for
instance, if we were to say: "We will accept
in Canada, duty free, all the wheat that may
come to us from Argentina or even South
America?"
It would spell blue ruin for our
western farmers and would place us at the
mercy of outside interests. In the case of
margarine, 90 per cent of its components
come from outside the country. We are helping people who work for ridiculously low
prices in North and South Africa to produce
peanut oil, palm oil and other vegetable oils,
and in turn these people, through their cheap
labour, are destroying our farm industry.
Therefore, underpaid workers in foreign lands
are in a position to ruin our Canadian industries. That is what is meant by dumping. In
the United States there is an overproduction
of cotton oil, which is used in the manufacture
of margarine. If the dumping of this cotton
oil into Canada were allowed, what would
happen to our own producers?
The removal of the 8 per cent tax is advocated.
If you compare the production of
margarine in Canada during January, February and March, 1949 to that of the sarne
period in 1950, you will see that it has more
than doubled during that time. Well, if this
8 per cent tax is so hard on the margarine
industry, one can well imagine what would
have
happened
had if
been
removed
altogether.
But let us be fair. I have said that the
whole situation should be taken into account.
One must think of the whole country and not
only of an industry which is seeking to take
advantage of slave labour, to the detriment of
our producers at home.
When margarine
was allowed in the
country, we were at the sane time permitted
to export meat to the United States. It could
not have been otherwise. As a result, we
are now paying $1.25, $1.30 and even $1.50
in some places, for meat which used to cost
£0 cents per pound at the most. Does the
farmer profit by this?
Are we consuming

MAY 3, 1950
more butter than meat? No. Econômically
speaking, it is unsound to endeavour to protect some producers in order to provide the
consumer with cheap food, thereby destroying
the primary producer, on whom the life of
the whole nation depends.
It is claimed that there is no 8 per cent tax
on marmalade, orangeade, peanut butter, etc.
Good heavens, what harm does it do to our
producers? Do oranges grow in Canada? Is
the peanut crop very plentiful? No. However, those who like them can have them, but
neither peanuts nor oranges number among
the staple foods of our country.
It is also pointed out that Newfoundland
did not want this 8 per cent tax on margarine
when the new province joined our confederation. In Newfoundland, no effort is made to
develop the dairy industry and understandably so. Once more, it is the economic side
of the question which must be considered.
The other day, someone said to me, in discussing this problem:
"What difference is there between your
philosophy and mine?"
"The difference, I told him, resides in the
fact that while I claim it is a philosophy, your
reasoning centers solely upon margarine."
The 8 per cent tax on ice cream has been
removed, because that product contains a
high percentage of milk, a health-giving
substance. Had I expected to speak about
margarine this afternoon, I would have
brought with me a report submitted by
Danish physicians after an investigation on
failing eyesight which is becoming general
in their country. After several years' research
work, these physicians have come to the
following conclusion: "Failing eyesight in
Denmark may be due to the protracted consumption of margarine."
It is desired also to abolish the law which
prohibits the colouring of margarine. Heavens
above, if this product was so very wholesome, so good and so useful to our country,
its colour would be absolutely immaterial.
However, certain interests are trying to
exploit the value of butter a most wholesome
product which forms the basis of milk, of
live substances. The publicity given to it, its
good name, its true value would be used to
introduce among us an artificial product
which does not compare with it. Anyone can
make this statement, which any physician
will uphold. On the other hand, it has been
alleged that margarine causes no harm. That
may be so, but if we have another product
which is wholesome and energy-giving, I
feel that the fact should be taken into consideration. Those who do good things should
55950-18

be encouraged. Why then fight ýto bring about
coloured margarine? Why indeed, when we
are offered a product which is so good, so
wholesome and possessed with a real basic
value? It will be sold, people will ask for
it. No, in this case a certain artificial means
is sought that other products need not call
upon because their primary content is milk,
the first food created for man by Providence.
We are also told: "We wish to abolish the
8 per cent tax in order to lower the cost of
living". However if we remove the tax on
margarine to secure a reduction in the cost
of living, while increasing by 100 per cent
the cost of meat and other food products,
will that argument stand? Let us be logical.
After all the consumption of butter is not
so very high in this country. A great deal
of meat is eaten here because the cold months
far exceed the summer ones. To live well,
one must be healthy.
In short, like my honourable colleague
!rom Waterloo, I want to express an opinion. I am opposed to margarine. He is in
favour. If I take a stand against this project
it is not because his opinion means little to
me. I have known and lived through the
years 1917 to 1921, after the first world
war, when we had margarine. At that time,
margarine ruined our dairy industry, our
livestock industry and our wheat production.
In Eastern Canada, the Government was
forced to pay Western farmers to have them
curtail their wheat acreages. There was an
over abundance of that grain.
If we do develop the production of margarine further, the difficulties that we experienced in the past will occur once more. It
seems to me that we should, in days to come,
take heed of our previous experience in
order to protect the dairy industry of Ontario,
Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, which is
most closely associated with livestock breeding. Should we ruin our dairy industry, our
farmers would be unable to make a living,
and they would have to give up animal
husbandry; then we would have a meat
shortage and the Government would be
forced once more to pay Western farmers to
stop producing as there would not be any
livestock to consume their grain.
When one takes a general view of the
situation, one has to consider the prosperity
of the nation as a whole. No man-made law
is so thorough as to be perfect. We must
consider the prosperity of the nation and also
the future of our country. That is my viewpoint and that is why I am opposed to
margarine. I trust the motion will be
rejected, in the best interest of the nation.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. M. Aselline moved the second
reading of Bill A-6, an Act to incorporate
Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, in 1908 a
mutual life insurance company was incorporated under the laws of the province of
Saskatchewan with the name of the Saskatoon Mutual Life Insurance Company, having
its head office at the city of Saskatoon, in the
province of Saskatchewan. Subsequently the
name was changed to "Saskatchewan Mutual
This company
Fire Insurance Company".
under its provincial charter, bas been carrying on business quite successfully in the provinces of Saskatchewan, British Columbia,
Alberta and Manitoba, with the result that
at the present time it is in excellent financial
condition, its surplus on December 31, 1949,
being almost $800,000.
The company is primarily concerned with
fire insurance and automobile insurance, the
volume of which has been increasing steadily
over the last few years. These are the two
large coverages provided by the company,
although it does write insurance in other
fields in varying amounts.
The main reason for the presentation of
this bill is that the company, which has been
growing steadily, feels that to maintain its
healthy financial condition it must broaden
its field of operation and spread its risks
over a much wider territory.
It desires,
therefore, to operate throughout the ten
provinces under a licence from the federal
Department of Insurance.
This bill follows generally the form of the
measures incorporating other mutual companies incorporated by the Dominion Parliament, such as the Gore Mutual of Ontario,
incorporated in 1937, and the Wawanesa
Mutual, incorporated in 1929, whose Act of
incorporation was extensively amended in
1941. This draft bill bas been approved by
the Superintendent of Insurance, and any
suggestions made by him have been adopted.
If it receives second reading, I intend to

MAY 4. 1950

move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills for
further consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Aseltine moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
STANDING COMMITTEES-THEIR
CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTIONS

MOTION
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, May 2,
the adjourned debate on the motion, as
amended, of Hon. Mr. Robertson:
1. That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to review the Constitution and functions
of the Standing Committees of the Senate and to
make such recommendations to facilitate the business of the Senate as it may deem necessary or
expedient.
2. That the said Committee be composed of the
Honourable Senators Aseltine, Beaubien, Bouffard,
Burchill, Emmerson, Farris, Fogo, Gladstone, Godbout, Haig, Hayden, Hugessen, Lambert, Moraud,
Robertson and Turgeon.

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,

when I moved the adjournment of the debate
on Tuesday, I overlooked the fact that I
had already spoken to the motion when it
was introduced. It is not my purpose to
transgress the rules of the Senate, but having
given the subject some thought I should like
to add to my previous remarks. As I have
stated, however, I do not wish to transgress
the rules of the Senate in any way.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it the pleasure of
honourable members that the honourable
gentleman be allowed to proceed?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I move that ,the honourable gentleman be heard.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no need for a
motion.
The Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure that Senator Reid
should proceed, notwithstanding the fact -that
he has already spoken to the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
thank you for your courtesy in allowing me
to speak again to the motion.
At the opening of my remarks today I
would say that it was only to be expected
that when this resolution was introduced
two questions would be raised: one pertaining to the reform of the Senate and the
other to the work of the Senate committees.

It is not my purpose now to deal with the
reform of the Senate. I have been too long
around the Parliament Buildings not to be
familiar with all the suggestions that have
been made, ranging all the way from Senate
reform to complete abolition. Incidentally, I
notice that even the C.C.F. party has changed
its mind about the complete abolition of the
Senate, and this policy is now being advocated
only in certain provinces and not by the
federal C.C.F. party.
There have also been proposals for reduction of the number of senators, for appointment by the provinces, for retirement at a
certain age, and for appointment regardless
of party affiliations. I do not intend to deal
with these. I wish to speak on the motion
before the house for the appointment of a
special committee to review the constitution
and functions of our standing committees.
First of all, I may say that on looking over
speeches and other records of the past, I find
that this question has arisen many times. Let
me also say at once that I entirely agree with
the remarks of the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), and thàt
to some extent I differ with my good friend
from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), who
voiced some objection to the investigation of
government expenditures by the Senate.
I do not believe that there is anyone who
would not admit that the expenditures of
government today warrant further study than
is given to them in the other house. I would
suggest to honourable senators that the supply
bill is the most important measure that parliament has to consider, and I would remind
honourable senatdrs that the last is not heard
of the supply bill when it has been passed
by the House of Commons and the Senate, for
in the prorogation ceremony, the Speaker of
the House of Commons, when he stands at the
bar of the Senate Chamber, carries the supply
bill in his hand-and it is the only bill that
he brings over here with him. Further, I
was surprised to learn, as perhaps other
senators will be, that it is the Clerk of the
Senate, not the Clerk of the House of Commons, who is officially the Clerk of Parliament, and he is the one in whose care and
charge the Acts of parliament and other parliamentary records are kept, and to whom
all inquiries must be made by persons seeking
information on these matters.
Since my appointment to the Senate I have
listened very carefully to discussions from time
to time about dealing with bills in Committee
of the Whole and about the admission of
departmental officials to the floor of the Senate when bills are being considered in that
committee. I am one of those who have long
held the opinion that the lifting of the Mace

SENATE
from the table in this or in the other house of
parliament is tantamount to the moving of
all the members present at the time to
another room. Hence I claim, subject to correction, that when we are sitting in Committee of the Whole it is quite proper to admit
to the floor of this chamber any official whom
we desire to interrogate.
I intend to be present at some meetings of
the proposed special committee and to suggest there-and I now suggest to the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson)-that
consideration be given to having the estimates in general studied by the Senate, sitting
as a committee of the Whole and, of course,
in a committee room, rather than divided
amongst various standing committees. There
are two things to be said in favour of this
.suggestion. In the first place, there would
always be a quorum; and, secondly, all
members of the Senate would have an opportunity to be present and take part in the
discussion.
Here I wish to take issue with the suggestion of my honourable friend the senator
from Wellington South (Hon. Mr. Gladstone),
that the proceedings of committees considering the estimates be taken down in shorthand
by our reporters. Let me state why I object
to that. I have served on many committees,
but I recall particularly the Commons Committee on War Expenditures, in which we
invariably found that witnesses spoke more
freely and gave more information when their
words were not being taken down by a shorthand reporter. Those of us who have had the
fortune-or perhaps I should call it the misfortune-to appear in the- witness-box know
that a certain feeling comes over us there,
and we are a little hesitant to express ourselves fully. So it is with an official appearing
before a committee. When he sees a reporter
writing down all he says, he is afraid to
express himself fully-I believe that we owe
a duty to departmental officials who appear
before our committees, and that in fairness we
should not ask them to express their opinions
on government policy. It would be a dangerous practice for the members of the Senate
to ask deputy ministers or other officials for
their opinions on certain subjects, for if this
practice were allowed to develop as it has
in the United States, we soon would have the
same chaotic conditions which now exist in
Washington, where civil servants are fighting
the government all the time.
I realize that the honourable leader of the
Senate would face an impossible task were
he to assume the responsibility of explaining
to this house all the questions that might be
asked concerning expenditures of the government or other measures which come before

this chamber. I believe that consideration
should be given to the proposal made some
years ago by the late Honourable Senator
Dandurand, when he suggested that some
sixteen or eighteen members of the Senate
should be designated not appointed; designated by the ministers of the Crown-and
they should have no standing-whose duty
would be to explain the various bills and

answer questions concerning the estimates
coming from the ministers who designated

them.

Most honourable senators know that

books containing explanations of the estimates
are prepared, and that three or four copies are
available. On each page details are given of
the items a minister may be called upon to
explain, and from that book he can even,
without the assistance of a deputy, answer any
question about ordinary or even extraordinary
expenditures. I cannot see why there should

be any objection to a system of that kind
being tried out here.
I would make a further suggestion-and in
making it-I
speak for myself, although I
realize that there are others in the Senate
who share my views. I do not know whether
my attitude was wrong when I came to this

house, but I came here believing that it was
my duty to review legislation coming from
the House of Commons and to act as, shall
I say, a kind of watchdog. But I find that
this chamber has degenerated-and I use the
word advisedly-into a body consisting of
political parties. For instance, we have here
a leader of the opposition-a title to which
I object. The division will probably become
more apparent when there is a government
change, and there is in this house an overwhelming majority of Liberal appointeees and
only a few senators appointed by a Conservative administration.
In support of my
argument I wish to quote the Honourable
John A. Macdonald, when he said:
There would be no use of an upper house, if it
did not exercise, when it thought proper, the right
of opposing or amending or postponing the legislation of the lower house. It would be of no value
whatever were it a mere chamber for registering
the decrees of the lower house.
It must be an
independent house, having a free action of its own,
for it is only valuable as being a regulating body,
calmly considering the legislation initiated by the
popular branch, and preventing any hasty or illconsidered legisIation which may come to that body,
but it will never set itself in opposition against the
deliberate and understood wishes of the people.

I think that that quotation, without referring
to other statements which were made very
well explains the intention with regard to
the Senate at the time of confederation, but
that position of the Senate did not last long.
There has been a great deal of talk about
changing the Senate, but probably we will
talk a lot about it

but do nothing as we

do about the weather.

But the Senate is

MAY 4, 1950
not like the weather, for we could, if we
really wanted to, do something about it.
In my opinion the appointment of Senators
at large would not bring about the changes
which the public of this country are looking
for at the present time.
The problems that we hear so much about
today are being emphasized because in this
house there are only a few opposition members facing an overwhelming majority
appointed by the present administration.
As I have already said, I sincerely believe
that the Senate should be an independent
body. I realize, however, that there are
members of the House of Commons, and
perhaps some senators, who would pass any
measure that the government proposed, and
who would not be alarmed even by the
taking away of our liberties. But we are
not all built alike; some of us take our duties
seriously; and as long as I am in the Senate
I will regard it as my duty to review legislation on behalf of the people and to off er
criticism, in spite of any suggestion that I
am disrespectful to the administration which
made my appointment. If that is not my
duty to this house, then it should be explained to me.
I am not enamored of the suggestion that
the provinces should make appointments to
the Senate, or that its members should be
retired at a certain age. But I do not
propose to go into that branch of the subject.
I am somewhat alarmed at what is going
on here at the present time. I can see the
division; and if, as I have said, a change
of government takes place, there will be a
change in the positions of the parties in this
house. Rightly or wrongly we have the
idea that when the leader of the opposition
objects he sometimes does so not because
he thinks the legislation is bad, but rather,
perhaps because the party to which he belongs is opposed to it. On the other hand,
we feel that members appointed by the
party in power are actuated by similar
motives, but of course they are in favour
of all measures introduced by the government.
I think it is time that we reviewed the
entire situation. I do not say that in a
carping sense at all. I realize that in view
of the short time I have been here it may
seem presumptuous on my part to offer the
suggestions I have made. I cannot help
feeling, however, that in speaking as I have
done I am serving not only the interests of
the people of Canada but also those of the
Sena.e. If some action is not taken, I
fear that the people of this country will
become more hostile and outspoken about the
Senate.

I believe that the changes which have taken
place in the House of Commons over the
years are not generally known. I went to
that house in 1930, and I can say that during
my earlier period there, and prior to it,
members of parliament really amounted to
something. But of late years many have
become more or less just numbers. We
may as well be frank and admit that the
power of the executive-not of the government-is becoming greater and more influential in the affairs of the country. Hence,
I say that the Senate has a real duty to
perform in keeping watch , over these encroaching powers. One can hardly talk to
a member of the other house without hearing the complaints: -"I thought I could do
something when I came here, but I find
that a lot of officials in various offices tell
me what I can do, and I have no redress".
If a member goes to a minister and complains, he is told to not raise a fuss publicly,
that he, the minister, will see what can be
done about the matter.
I believe that the Senate must look at conditions today in the light of what is transpiring, and I hope that serious note will be
taken of the suggestions made this afternoon.
I believe that the entire membership of the
Senate should sit on a committee for the consideration of expenditures. When we realize
our total expenditures amount to $2 billion
330 million, of which 45 per cent is statutory,
the matter becomes a most serious one. I
could mention a half dozen expenditures made
last year which, if the Senate had examined
them, might not have gone through. How
many members of the Senate would have
risen in their places to advocate the spending
of $4 million to provide television in Montreal
and Toronto? How much support would that
expenditure have received from senators
representing the Maritime Provinces and
British Columbia? Yet the body demanding
that money was not the government, but
merely a board, set up apart from the government. Nevertheless this house passed that
vote; and I confess that I, in the other house,
may also have been a consenting party to it.
Why does this kind of thing go on? Every
honourable gentleman who has sat in the
other place knows why there is no effective
curtailment of expenditures. The honourable
senator from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)
put his finger on the trouble when he said
that whether a member of the Commons
remains in that house or ceases to belong to
it, depends largely on the degree of his success
in obtaining appropriations for post offices,
wharves, and what not. To oppose expenditures in some other district might lay him
open in turn to similar treatment from the
representative of that riding. In view of the

SENATE
seriousness of our financial situation, and the
growth of bureaucracy, this chamber would
be well advised to give its serious attention
to the estimates, and deal with them in the
manner I have suggested.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Farquhar: It was not my
intention to take part today in this debate,
but, having listened to the remarks of the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), I feel impelled to say something. The honourable senator has spoken
of what he calls the playing of politics and
taking of sides in this house. I wish to tell
this honourable body that my impression of
the proceedings in this chamber is not the
same as his. It is my belief that there is very
little playing of politics in this house, and
that in this respect the Senate is very differ-

ent from the place of which I was formerly
a member. Do not misunderstand me, honourable senators. I am not stating that all
the members of the House of Commons play
politics. A great many of them do not; they
stand, regardless of party, for what they
believe is right. I know that to be a fact.
I have had years of experience in politics,
not only in the House of Commons but in a
provincial legislature, so I know whereof I
speak.

But one thing about membership of

this house that has greatly appealed to me is
that the opposition parties have not tried to
talk partisan politics. I believe that all they

have said was the expression of their conscientious convictions, and I respect that
spirit.
Another statement of the honourable senator from New Westminster to which I must
take objection is that in the House of Commons a member is more or less a number.
In 1935, on the first occasion that I heard the
ex-Prime Minister speak in caucus-in mentioning this I do not think I reveal any
secret-one of the earliest remarks he made
in addressing himself to the new members
was this: "Gentlemen, I want to tell you that
your first duty is to be true to yourselves,
true to your own convictions." I have never
forgotten that injunction, and I try to observe
it faithfully. I believe that that attitude
characterizes very many members of the
other house. and I do not think that the
expression "only a number" should be applied
to any of them.
There are a few other matters to which I
wish to refer. Some honourable senators
have asserted that the estimates have not
received proper consideration. That statement astonishes me. From my experience in
the other place I would say that it is anything but the fact. Indeed the reverse is
true; the estimates receive very careful

consideration. I could give many examples,
but I will confine myself to one illustration,
relating to the obtaining of a post office, let
us say, in my constituency. I do not mind
telling you that while a member of the other
house I was successful in securing no less
than four post offices for my riding.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: But what I want to
impress upon you is how difficult the task
proved to be, what a struggle I had with
the departments in order to get these post
offices built, necessary though they were.
Let us assume that I am asking for the
erection of a post office building somewhere
in my constituency. First, I go to the Postmaster General and ask him to obtain a
report as to the necessity of this work. The
minister notifies the district inspector, who
goes to the district, makes an inquiry and
presents a report. If his report favours the
project, it is presented to the Postmaster
General, who refers it to his officials to
ascertain whether everything is in order,
whether the amount of revenue warrants the
action proposed, and so on.
The official
charged with this duty knows, as an officer
of the department, that unless -the case for
action is conclusive he should make a negative report. He knows too, that many recommendations to the department for such
improvements must be rejected. However, let
us assume that I am successful and that the
official reports in favour of the project. The
Postmaster General sizes up the facts, meditates on how he can avoid building this post
office, and uses every argument he can think
of to justify that course. But providing I am
successful in persuading the Postmaster
General that the post office should be built,
the recommendation goes to the Minister
of Public Works, and he in turn sends it to
his deputy minister, from whom it goes to
the chief engineer.
The engineer realizes
that he must assist his minister in every way
he can to keep down the departmental estimates, and he tries to find some way to
avoid incurring this expense. We will say
that here again I am successful, and that
the chief engineer is persuaded that the
post office should be built. When his report
is submitted to the Minister of Public Works,
the minister has to decide how much of the
total expenditures proposed can be recommended to his colleagues, and if he can find
a reason for turning me down he is going
to delay action. However, we will say that
again I am successful. The matter then goes
to the cabinet. The practice today is for the
members of the cabinet to decide how much
money they are going to spend in the current
year, and for the Treasury Board to keep the

MAY 4, 1950
allotments within that sum. However, suppose that the item goes to the Treasury Board.
Usually the Minister of Finance is chairman
of that board, which goes over the estimates
with great care. This year, I am told, the
Treasury Board sat, usually twice a day, for
four weeks. Their practice is to examine the
items very closely and to eut and slash in
every possible direction.
A member of
parliament is not permitted to appear before
the board, and unless he is fortunate enough
to have on the board someone who is
interested in his particular item and will
give it his support, the member can forget
about it; he won't get his post office vote
through. Let us say that once more I am
successful, that some good friend of mine
at the Treasury Board realizes how badly
I need that post office and puts in a word on
my behalf, which brings the desired results.
Finally the item comes before the other
house.
Now, I want to tell you that once an item
has been approved by the Treasury Board
you can forget about it. In all my experience
in the other house and in the provincial
legislature, I never knew of an estimate being
eut by as much as one dollar after it had
been approved by the Treasury Board. There
may have been cases in which expenditures
have been reduced but I never heard about
them. I warn honourable senators that they
will be disappointed if they expect to bring
about economie changes in estimates that
they may be considering in committee. These
items have been- so closely scrutinized all
along the way that there is not much room
for anything further to be said or done.
We hear talk about the careful inspection
given the estimates when they reach the
committee stage in another place; but let
me tell you that very seldom does anyone
ask for a reduction in any item; on the
contrary, increases are always being sought.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: I have just jotted down
a few of the requests that have been made:
increased subsidies, increased prices of wheat
and other grains, increased old age pensions
and other social security measures, and
greater consideration for veterans' allowances.
I did not intend to speak at any length,
but I want to make one suggestion. This
year several standing committees of the
Senate were authorized to examine the various expenditures proposed in the estimates
for the present fiscal year, and a committee
of the House of Commons is doing the very
same thing.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I believe my honourable
friend is under a wrong impression. The

committee in the other house is investigating
the public accounts as presented in the
Auditor General's report.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: The appointment of
such a committee was under discussion when
I was in the other house. It was thought that
by handling the estimates in this manner
much of the discussion on the floor of the
house would be eliminated and I was under
the impression that this was now being done.
If this were so, I was going to suggest that
it might be well to appoint a joint committee
of both houses of parliament to consider the
estimates. This would eliminate covering the
ground twice, and it would save the time of
the busy departmental officials.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, if no one desires to discuss this
resolution further, I should like to close the
debate.
Some Hon. Senators: Proceed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should like to thank
those honourable senators who have spoken
to this resolution. Their observations, based
on long parliamentary experience, have constituted a splendid contribution. I had hoped
that this would be so, because when I proposed the resolution it was incumbent upon
me to indicate why I was introducing it, and
to give some of my own views about what
the committee should consider. Those suggestions were based on my experience in
my present position, and whether or not
honourable members have seen fit to agree
with them is entirely beside the point.
I felt that the proposal of the honourable
senator fbrom East Kootenay (Hon. Mr. King),
that some of the junior senators should serve
on this committee, was a valuable one. I
accepted his advice, and accordingly made
the appropriate appointments. I would say,
however, that most of the debate has been
confined to a discussion of the activities of
our standing committees in the handling of
the estimates. I do not think there is any
doubt that the Senate has authority to consider the supply bill which comes to it each
year. Indeed, not a single dollar would be
legally appropriated by parliament unless the
Senate passed that bill. That is our responsibility, and it is just a question as to what we
should do. Should we merely rubber stamp
the supply bill, without giving proper consideration to the details involved?
I think it was the honourable member for
East Kootenay who pointed out that during
the war years the Finance Committee was
empowered to consider the estimates before
they were presented to the house. I do not
remember much about the functions of that

SENATE
committee, but since assuming my present
responsibility as leader of the government in
the Senate I know that on several occasions
the Finance Committee has held special meetings at which members of the government,
departmental officials and other persons have
explained various estimates and outlined the
policy of government departments.
For
instance, last year the Minister of National
Defence explained to our Finance Committee
the background of Canada's defence alppropriations. In a general way he outlined our
army, navy, and air force expenditures, comparing them with corresponding expenditures
in the United States and the United Kingdom.
While it is true that in my time the details
of the estimates have never been given real
consideration here, at some stage of each
session I have had to present to this house
one or more interim supply bills. On
these occasions I have always explained that
the granting of the sums of money asked
for would not affect the right of honourable
senators to raise questions when the general
estimates came before them. With this
explanation these interim supply bills have
invariably been adopted. Then, at the very
end of each session I have introduced a
final supply bill, which has never been for
less than $2 billion. The Senate has then
had to pass this bill or there would have
been no money to carry on the public service of the country.
So in what position do I find myself? In
actual practice the supply bill comes to this
house at the very end of the session, often
less than an hour before prorogation.
Generally speaking, the procedure in the
other house is to continue discussion on the
estimates from day to day, with some items
in the various departmental estimates being
left open until all other legislation has been
cleaned off, and the last two or three or more
days of the session may be devoted entirely
to estimates. In those circumstances we, with
our order paper clear, wait for the supply bill
to be sent over. As honourable senators
know, it has frequently happened that we
have met in the morning in expectation of
receiving the supply bill, and as it has not
arrived we have adjourned until three o'clock
in the afternoon; and then, for the same
reason we have adjourned until eight in the
evening, when sometimes a further adjournment until the next morning has been necessary.

That procedure has to be carried on sometimes for several days, until at last there
suddenly comes word that the supply bill has
passed the other house. Then the bill is
hurriedly sent over here, our bell rings,
honourable senators assemble, and I in my

capacity of leader make as full an explanation of the measure as I can in the short
interval remaining before the time set for
the arrival of the Deputy Governor General
to prorogue parliament. In those circumstances the leader of the opposition or the
deputy leader invariably complains, as is his
right, that the passing by a group of soberminded people of a bill voting some $2 billion,
without any detailed consideration, is not a
very edifying spectacle. It is true that we
could stand on our dignity and on our right,
and insist on studying the bill in detail. We
could say to the House of Commons: "We are
resolved to take a week-or two weeks or
three weeks or four weeks, if necessary-to
study these estimates which you have only
now sent us, and you may wait until we have
completed our study".
I fancy we would have a right to take that
stand, but let us be realistic about this. As
the end of each session approaches it is
invariably the custom for members of both
houses who do not live in Ottawa, and particularly those whose homes are a long distance away, to make train or plane reservations in anticipation of the closing of the
session by a certain date, and when the
session lasts beyond that date the attendance
of members in each house is relatively small
-in
fact, it is often difficult to obtain a
quorum. Now, suppose on the day that the
supply bill is sent over to the Senate, when
everyone is expecting the session to end, I
asked honourable members to give detailed
consideration to the estimates, what reception
would my appeal get? That suggestion only
needs to be put to show how impractical it is.
Therefore, honourable senators, it seems to
me that we must do one of two things: we
must either ask that we be divested of all
responsibility with respect to the expenditure
of public moneysHon. Mr. King: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
says "No, no", and I think he is right. If we
wanted to be rid of that responsibility, I do
not believe that the people whom we represent would consent, for everyone who thinks
about the matter at all realizes that one of
the most effective controls over the executive
is the right to withhold supply. Recently I
was reading some debates on the need for a
second chamber like the Senate, and one of
the arguments advanced was that if any
government of the day so far forgot itself as
to try to penalize a particular part of the
country through a money bill, the second
chamber could block the measure. So I
believe that if we attempted to discard our
control over supply, the people whom we

MAY 4, 1950
represent would not let us do it. I think we
can wash out any suggestion that we be
relieved of this duty.
Now, if we are going to continue our control
over the estimates, shall we simply perforn
the function of a rubber-stamp or shall we
review and study the estimates? That is a
reasonable question to put to a group of
serious people.
Hon. Mr. Euler: We rubber-stamp the estimates afterwards.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will deal with that
point, for it is pertinent, and similar to the
question asked the other day by the honourable gentleman from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies), to this effect: "Well, what can we do
about supply anyway?" But first I want to
come to the question asked on the same day
by the honourable gentleman from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden), as to whether it was
not the primary function of the Senate to
review the work of the House of Commons
before it is finally adopted, and, if so,
whether our investigation of estimates before
they have been dealt with by that house
would not cause some conflict. Well, as I
have already pointed out, I do not think it is
practical to postpone our review of the
estimates until the supply bill reaches us.
Now, whether we continue our present practice of referring some estimates to the Finance
Committee and others to various other standing committees, or adopt the method proposed by the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), is a matter
that can be considered by the special committee which this motion proposes be set up,
and afterwards by the Senate; but I think it
will be agreed that our study of the estimates should be made before the supply bill
comes to us.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Instead of having the
supply bill sent to us in the last minutes of
the session, would it not be possible to have
it reach here in time for us to deal with it
thoroughly before prorogation?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The fact is that the
other house does not finish with all the estimates until the very end of the session.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But it might be possible
for that house to finish the consideration of
them earlier.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend's
parliamentary experience is much longer than
mine, but I think he will not dispute my
point that in practice the session ends when
the House of Commons passes the final
estimates.
Now I come to the other point which my
honourable friend raised a few moments ago,

and the question of the honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies). I was interested in the remark of the honourable gentleman from Algoma (Hon. Mr. Farquhar), that
during his membership of another place he
had never known the estimates to be reduced
by a dollar. That accords with my own
impression. However, dealing with the question of what is a practical course for the
Senate to pursue, in ordinary circumstances,
I would suggest that if at any time after a
study of the public accounts and estimates we
found that much smaller expenditures could
be made in a certain field without harm to
the public interest, we should not reduce any
specific items, but rather should make a
report setting out our conclusions and the
reasons for them, and urging the government
to reduce certain items in the next year's
estimates. That is just my own view of
what would be the most practical course for
the Senate. I realize, of course, that some
honourable members may not agree with me.
I am convinced, however, that a carefully
prepared report of that kind from the Senate
would carry great weight; but if-to suppose
an extreme case-the government chose to
ignore our recommendations entirely, then it
would be for this house to decide what further
action it should take.
I think it is inevitable that we consider the
estimates before the supply bill reaches the
Senate. My honourable friend from Kootenay
East (Hon. Mr. King) said he felt our study
of any department's estimates should not
precede the minister's explanation of them in
the other house. That would mean considering them after the supply bill came before us,
which I do not think is practicable. True,
some ministers explain individual items in
their estimates early in the session, but consideration of the fiscal estimates is not completed until very late in the session. I believe,
therefore, if we are to consider the estimates
effectively, we must do so as soon as possible
after the parliament opens.
I come now to a further suggestion, namely,
that next year we should take advantage of
the early tabling of the estimates. I think
it was my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) who asked me if I had any
guarantee that the estimates would come
down early in the next session. The honourable member from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King) expressed the opinion that the early
tabling of the estimates would not happen
again. In answer to my friends I may say
that I can of course give no guarantee in the
matter. I have looked at the records, and
certainly this session, when the estimates were
tabled within eight days of the opening, has
been exceptional in that respect. In the preceding session the estimates were brought

SENATE

down 41 days after parliament opened; and
in the session before, 33 days elapsed before
they were tabled.
I noticed that last session, during the dis,
cussion on interim supply, the minister
referred to the criticism that the estimates
were coming down late in the session, and
intimated that he hoped to do better next
year-by which he meant the present session.
Though the estimates were brought down
within 8 days of the opening of this session,
he did not say that he hoped to be able to do
the same thing next year.
Bearing in mind the discussion which has
taken place, I am confidently hopeful that
next session we will have the estimates before
us within a short time soon after parliament
opens. We may not get them in as short a
time as 8 days, but I expect them to reach us
in less than 33 or 47 days, as happened in the
two previous sessions.
I would say, for the sake of argument, that
our committees are not precluded from
investigating the finances of the country
before the estimates are tabled. I would
point out that, under the statutes, the public
accounts, accompanied by the report of the
Auditor General, must be tabled by the
minister before the 31st day of October, if
parliament is then sitting; or, if not, within
one week after parliament next assembles.
I have come to the conclusion that this
ajuestion of estimates and public finances is
so complex that a two-week study in anticipation of the actual consideration of the estimates would bear fruit. I appreciate the
remarks which have been made and the criticism offered on this question. To my honourable friend from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King), I expressed the hope that honourable
senators would state their views, which
would be considered by the committee and
ultimately passed upon by the Senate. I have
assumed a certain responsibility in this matter, and I trust that nobody feels that automatically he must either support my suggestions or oppose them.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. King: Before the leader closes his
remarks, would he care to express himself
on the opinion held by some that the financial
policy for the year is declared in the budget,
and that it is disclosed when the budget is
presented?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I quite agree with my
honourable friend's view that the financial
policy is contained in the budget, and that it
could be discussed at some length before the
supply bill comes down. If the committee
feels that any good purpose would be served
by delaying our consideration of the estimates

until after the presentation of the budget, I
have no bjection; but the contemplated
expenditures appear in the estimates which
are presented some time before, and I cannot
see why our consideration of them should be
regarded as a reflection on the other place.
As was pointed out the other day, the
estimates are tabled in this house as soon as
they are received, and of course they are the
property of this house and cannot be passed
until we agree to them. Whether we choose
to examine them in detail or to place on them
the rubber stamp of approval, is for this
house to decide.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: Honourable senators, I
wish to correct any impression, which I may
have left with the house, that I am not in
favour of having a committee to investigate
the estimates. I am, in fact, very strongly
in favour of it. What I said was that I had
no recollection of the estimates ever having
been reduced. Nevertheless, I feel that every
honourable senator should have full information on the estimates, and I am in favour of a
committee of the Senate investigating them.
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: Cannot the question
of overstaffed departments and duplication be
considered at any time, quite apart from the
actual bringing down of the estimates?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is complete
justification for that when the public accounts
and the report of the Auditor-General are
under consideration.

The motion was agreed to.
MARGARINE-REMOVAL

OF TAX

MOTION
The

Senate

resumed from

yesterday

the

adjourned debate on the motion of the
Honourable Senator Euler seconded by the
Honourable Senator Lambert, that in the
opinion of the Senate margarine should be
added to the list of foods which are exempt
from the sales tax of 8 per cent.
Hon.

Norman

P.

Lambert: Honourable

senators, I wish to state briefly my reasons
for seconding the resolution which was presented yesterday in as able a speech as I
have heard in this house. As one of those
who supported the senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) in his repeated attempts
to remove the legislative ban from oleomargarine, what I had in mind at that time
was the desirability of making available to
the many consumers of this country a wholesome and nutritious food at a price that
would bring about a reduction in the cost of
living. I still think of oleomargarine in that
way. The consumer's need is the measuring
rod that should be applied to this question.

MAY 4, 1950
The consumer is, and always will be, the
greatest common denominator of all classes
in our community. He represents the producers on the land, in the mines, in the
forests and the fisheries, as well as workers
in the factory, office and on our lines of
transport.
I support 'this resolution because I feel
that the 8 per cent sales tax interferes
seriously with the basic interest of the
Canadian consumer, and therefore prejudices
the best economic interests of Canada as a
whole. In addition, as has been pointed out,
this tax, as applied in the different provinces,
is discriminatory and invidious.
The question of needed revenue has been
raised by my honourable friend the senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen). His
remarks imply, at least, that margarine is
wanted and is being used in considerable
volume. If revenue is to be the criterion of
this issue, why not distribute the 8 per
cent tax over the whole range of other foods,
such as ice cream and butter, instead of
loading the entire burden on margarine? It
must be remembered that the law of diminishing returns may apply to a food tax, as
to anything else, when it becomes too burdensome.
However, I do not think that revenue is
by any means the sole object of this tax. It
represents mainly, in my opinion, a measure
of protection to the dairy industry, which
for years has been one of the most stronglyorganized and deeply-entrenched privileged
interests in Canada.
I have maintained before, and do so again,
that the sale of margarine in this country
does not necessarily injure the dairy industry. The products derived from the yield of
the dairy cow are widely varied, and are not
economically represented by butter alone.
Whole milk, cheese, ice cream, powdered and
evaporated preparations afford a range of
output which may be stimulated rather than
injured by the presence of margarine on the
tables of the consuming public. Internal
trade begets internal trade, as foreign trade
begets foreign trade. I think that principle
should not be lost sight of in connection with
the discussion of the sale of margarine in
Canada. If I had my way, for the benefit
of consumers and producers alike, I would

provide as wide a measure as possible of
free trade in food products, including margarine and all dairy stuffs. I am sorry that
my honourable friend from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt) is not here, because I
should like to ask him if he knows any member of the dairy industry in the Enstern
Townships of Quebec who would reject the
possibility and the prospect of a free trade
relationship with the neighbouring republic.
In this connection I emphasize that the
whole question of expansion of world trade
is closely associated with the resolution
which was presented yesterday. On the surface this may not appear to be so; but I
believe that that question must be solved
through the application of practical details.
In the near future we shall be discussing a
resolution relating to the Western Union and
the North Atlantic pact. Economic co-operation as well as military defence is involved.
Phrases such as "economic co-operation" and
"free access to the food and raw materials of
the world" have been reiterated since the
date of the Atlantic Charter-all through the
period of the lease-lend agreements which
this country negotiated during the war, and
during the formation of the United Nations
and its international trade organizationdown to the present time. Are we giving
mere lip service to these things? What do
they mean to us? It would seem, when we
get down to brass tacks on one simple aspect
of this great problem, such as is represented
in this resolution, that they do not mean
anything. I submit that our failure to face
the realities in these smaller things gives
colour to the suggestion of hypocrisy and
ranting in connection with the greater world
issues.
On economic grounds, I think, as well as
from a broad social and political viewpoint,
the time has come when the people of this
country should be enabled to purchase their
staple food supplies under conditions which
are reasonably fair and competitive. I believe
this resolution is directed to that end, and
I give it my support.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Euler, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Lambert, that in the
opinion of the Senate margarine should be
added to the list of foods which are exempt
from the sales tax of 8 per cent.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
my contribution to this debate will be
extremely brief. First of all I should like in
a very humble way to express my welcome
to the new senator from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Isnor). I am sure that he will be a useful
addition to this chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon.

Mr. Gershaw:

I am

opposing

this

motion largely because I want to do everything possible to assist irrigation in this
country. The people of Canada and, indeed,
half the people of the world, require more
fruit and vegetables, poultry and meat products, and these are the very things best produced on irrigated land. Irrigation farmers
produce large quantities of butter, because
the making of this product fits in naturally
with their best farming practices, and it is
generally feared-and with good reasonthat their earning power will be greatly
reduced if butter is displaced by a substitute
product. These farmers send their cream to
a neighbouring creamery, where it is made

MAY 5, 1950
into butter. Some of the people still churn
their cream. The buttermilk is a splendid
drink for those working on the farm, and the
little pigs and calves certainly appreciate the
skimmed milk. The cheques for the butter
itself or the cream are the means of providing groceries in these farm homes week after
week, and the older children have been
educated, even put through college, by the
savings of the butter maker in these homes.
At the present moment the government is
launching a large reclamation program, and
this is pertinent to the resolution before us.
It is felt that the great drought-stricken areas
should be reclaimed because of the repeated
crop failures there. Almost every year money
has to be paid out, Under the Prairie Farm
Assistance Act, as drought bonuses to farmers
who have practically lost their crops. Last
year the amount paid out on this account was
no less than $21 million, which indicates that
the crop failure was very serious. The farmers put in wheat, because it resists the
drought better than any other crop, but they
stand by helplessly and in despair when the
dry winds of June or early July burn up their
crops. If they were on irrigated ground they
could have vegetable gardens, flowers, trees
and shrubs; they could keep poultry and livestock, and could make themselves independent of the drought bonus.
The reclamation program is being launched
in quite a big way by the Minister of Agriculture. Already on the prairies about half a
million acres are being irrigated, and plans
are almost complete for the irrigation of
another half-million acres. The biggest project in this new area will be the so-called St.
Mary's Milk River scheme, by which the
waters of this international stream will be
held in large reservoirs for use in irrigation.
The key structure is the big Spring Coulee
reservoir, about thirty miles south of Lethbridge. The dam there will be the largest
earth-fill that has ever been attempted in
Canada. It extends for half a mile along the
crest, is two hundred feet high and half a mile
from toe to toe, being designed to withstand
the enormous pressure of 300,000 acre-feet of
water in the reservoir, which will be seventeen miles long and six miles wide at the
widest place and will irrigate 345,000 acres
of land.
Another scheme in that same district is
the Bow river development, which was
started many years ago by private capital
from Britain. It has irrigated a relatively
small district of 55,000 acres for a number
:)f years. However, irrigation now is big
->usiness and private capital is not available
for it, so it is necessary for the government
to put up the money for the initial cost. That

scheme can be extended, and negotiations are
already completed for irrigating another
192,000 acres. The beginning of this extension has been discouragingly slow, though
not because of lack of money, but rather
because of difficulty in getting clear title to
the land.
A good deal more irrigating can be done.
For instance, the Red Deer river, which bas
its source at the foothills of the Rocky mountains, flows all the way across the province
of Alberta. Yet along its whole course there
is not a single dam, turbine or irrigation
canal to conserve the water and prevent it
from flowing uselessly on to the Hudson Bay.
With very little expense dams could be placed
along that river, and the water could be
diverted into natural reservoirs, from which,
by means of gravity-no pumping would be
needed-it could be caused to flow over the
land.
Honourable senators, we do not have to
take any lessons from Russia, but in the
latest copy of the Kiwanis Magazine there is
an article which tells something of the
immensity of the reclamation program which
is being carried on by that country. There
a shelter belt of trees 3,000 miles long is
being erected to prevent the hot winds of
the central plains of Asia from blowing over
the farmlands, and thus destroying the growing crops. Also, the water level of the great
Caspian Sea is being kept up by reason of
the fact that large rivers which previously
flowed into the Arctic Ocean are now diverted
and flow into that sea. Reservoirs are being
built all along these rivers, and what formerly
were barren areas have now been turned into
fertile farms.
In the United States, where there is of
course a huge population, some 20 million
acres are now under irrigation. In that
country irrigation is practised on lands where
there is an annual rainfall of as much as 20
inches, whereas in Canada there are areas in
which the annual rainfall is only 10 inches.
The United States spends as much as $300 or
$400 per acre to irrigate, whereas in Canada
the figure is only some $40 or $50 per acre.
The United States plans within the next ten
years to spend $3 billion for this purpose.
The expenditure of money in Canada for
irrigation purposes will pay large dividends.
A dry area, when irrigated, will support
twenty times as many people as it previously
did. When water is put on cultivated land
it helps the adjacent ranch lands; stockwatering reservoirs are constructed and the
capacity of the land for grazing purposes is
increased. Further, planned irrigation helps
the farmers to produce diversified crops to
supply canning factories, beet sugar factories,

SENATE
freezing plants and other enterprises of that
kind. The soil in the area to which I refer
has been examined by the Department of
Soils of the University of Alberta, and found
to be a highly productive loam.
Honourable senators, I hope I am not making a mistake in opposing this motion, but I
feel that nothing should be done which would
discourage the farmer or reduce the revenue
of the people in the agricultural industry. I
believe that irrigation can be more successfully carried on if there is a market for butter
at prices which are reasonable, and in keeping
with the cost of production.
All down through history people have
gathered together where food can be produced in abundance, and at the present time
returned soldiers and farmers from the
drought-stricken areas are most anxious to
get on irrigated land. They want to substitute
the growing of products which offer security
for the gamble they take in producing wheat.
They prefer the community life of a populated area to the lonesomeness of desolate
lands. To help them fulfil that ambition it is
necessary for us to make it possible for them
to make a good living, and every encouragement should be extended to them. I belierve
that butter-making is an important factor in
their success.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: There is one part
of the speech of the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) with which
I thoroughly agree, and that is his kindly
reference to the new senator from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Isnor). The newest acquisition by
this body sat in the House of Commons,
where I was one of his humble colleagues;
and he and I have been the warmest friends
for a good many years. I have admired him
in the bouse and out of it, to say nothing of
the skill which has characterized his relations with his constituents, and the very
large majorities which his neighbours and
friends in Halifax have given him in
repeatedly returning him to Ottawa. I join
the honourable senator from Medicine Hat
in welcoming him to this chamber. I hope
that his stay here. will be as happy as mine
has been during the last five years, and that
he will contribute very much more to our
deliberations than I have been or will be able
to do.
With some of the other statements of the
honourable senator from Medicine Hat I cannot agree so unreservedly. Of course I
sympathize with him in his desire to benefit
the people of the district from which he
comes, and I recognize his right to reflect
and express the views which naturally they

hold. But there is no very obvious connection between the needs of the housewives of
my constituency and the reclamation projects
in the West which he advocates. 1, too, may
be influenced by local interests, but I cannot
see how the building at government expense
of the Spring Coulee Dam in the far west is
relevant to the provision of a cheap commodity to supply the tables of the families,
most of whom are poor, in the district
where I reside.
I am in favour of the present motion. I
support it for a number of reasons, two of
which I shall mention presently. In passing,
I would express my congratulations to the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), who is responsible for this motion, and
whose previous resolutions with regard to
oleomargarine I supported on a number of
At times, no doubt, some of us
occasions.
feel a sense of frustration at being fated to
accomplish so little, seemingly, in the great
world in which we live. It bas been the
fortune of the honourable senator from
Waterloo to realize the fruits of his efforts
during his lifetime. He has brought some
benefits-small benefits, if you will-to the
tables of thousands upon thousands of his
fellow citizens who, during this last year or
so. have been enjoying a wholesome and
nutritious food that, but for his action, they
might not have been able to obtain. So I
congratulate him heartily: in the course of
the'brief life-span allotted to him-as to all
of us-unlike many of his fellows, he bas
been able to leave some "footprints on the
sands of time".
I support the present resolution on at least
two grounds. First, I am opposed to sales
taxes as being ill-advised, and not in the
public interest. Second, I oppose this particular application of the sales tax as one of
the worst instances of a bad principle in
action. I think the sales tax is the most
vicious of the many repressive forms of taxation in which we indulge. Legislatures and
public men generally pay too little attention
to the incidence of taxation; I mean, the
effects of certain types of taxation upon the
community. Taxes may be divided into two
classes. First, there are those that are direct
and do not increase the cost of production and
of living. Such, for example, are the excess
profits tax, the income tax, and taxation of
land values. The excess profits tax does not
increase the cost of living or of doing
business; income taxes do not add to expenses
of production or enhance prices; land-value
taxes actually operate in the reverse direction. But there is another class of taxes that
falls, usually indirectly, upon production, and
which increases the cost of living, hampers

MAY 5. 1950
business operations and adversely affects
production and profits. In this class are
included tariffs, sales taxes and a number of
other imposts. First, they tend to bring about
inflation, they reduce wages by raising the
cost of living, and they decrease the purchasing power of the dollar. Second, they cause
industrial unrest, because demands for
increases of wages disturb the general
business trends of the country and provoke
the industrial contests which occur when men
are trying to preserve their standards of living. Finally, they increase the cost of doing
business in Canada; make it more difficult
for business to compete, particularly abroad;
and they reduce the profits from which
business contributes under other forms of
taxation. Generally speaking, they promote
bankruptcy and bring about stagnation.
The worst of this class of taxation is the
sales tax, because directly and obviously it
increases the cost of production. It raises
prices, lowers standards of living, and has a
tendency to promote depression and unrest.
Above all, the cost of collecting it is out of
all proportion to the amount received. It
has been estimated that, for every dollar
which enters the public treasury as a result
of sales taxes, the cost to the general public
is two dollars.
A picturesque and startling illustration of
the effects of this kind of taxation is to be
found in the history of Spain. At one time
that country was a prosperous world power,
the ships of her magnificent navy calling to
trade at every port on the globe. Then the
ruling nobles decided that they could shift
their feudal burdens by levying taxes equivalent to our sales tax. They shifted the
burden from the landlords, the big territorial
owners of Spain, to the shoulders of the
masses, the people who sustain the business
of any country, and within fifty years Spain
was reduced to a fifth-rate power. That is
just one illustration of many which serves to
show why I am opposed to sales taxes in
general.
In my judgment a tax which is levied
against the food of our people is the worst
kind of sales tax. It makes it more difficult
for our men and women to raise their
children. An excellent illustration of the
value of good food was shown in a test
recently conducted in Toronto. A group of
children in a community were given one good
meal a day, and within a comparatively short
time the growth and general health of these
children reflected the good food they had
been eating. They were in better health and
had grown more than other children of the
same community who had continued to eat
the meals to which they had been accustomed.

The sales tax upon this one special type of
food which we are discussing tends to make,
it more difficult for our children to get a
nutritious food they should have. The tax
is discriminatory because it affects this one
item and not food generally. I believe it
was the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) who recently said that if
it were necessary to secure revenue by a
tax on foodstuffs, then that tax should be
spread out over all foods. Well, I do not
think we have to get revenue by such taxation, and I am opposed to it.
The tax on oleomargarine is essentially
unjust because it was imposed not for the
comparatively small revenue it returns but
for the benefit of one class at the expense of
another. Does anyone suppose that this
tax would not be immediately abolished if it
were not for the influence of the dairy interests? It is not a matter of taxation; it is a
matter of favouring a certain class in the
community. And that class is not the one
to which the honourable member from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) referredfarmers who make the butter in churns-but
consists of the dairy interests in Canada. Do
you think anyone would entertain a suggestion that the poorer housewives of the district which I have the honour to represent
should be called upon to make a charitable
donation to the dairy interests of Canada?
Such a suggestion would be laughed out of
court, but that is actually the effect of the
sales tax on oleomargarine. The cost of
living of the poor is increased to give something more to the dairy interests. I would
oppose this sales tax as a matter of principle,
even if I did not find it so destructive as I do.
It is argued that the government needs the
revenue, but I would point out that this tax
violates every sound principle of taxation.
It takes no cognizance of ability to pay and
is levied upon those who, for the most part,
are in the poorest position to meet it. I think
it goes without saying that butter is a nicer
spread on bread than oleomargarine. I am
pretty certain that the ordinary man would
take butter if you offered him his choice at
your dinner table. The people who are using
margarine are those who can afford margarine better than they can afford butter.
Hon. Mr. Mclntyre: What is the present
difference in the price of oleomargarine and
of butter? Is the price of margarine much
lower?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Much lower.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: The difference is 22
cents.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you for the
information. My honourable friend had the

SENATE
information, and did not need to ask for it.
The difference in price is considerable, and
the greater the difference the better pleased
I am, because it means increased benefits for
the poor. I am not in favour of taking away
anything from the poor. Our people have
benefited a great deal since our courts
removed the restrictive legislation which prevented the manufacture and sale of margarine, and I think we should do everything
possible to make this product more accessible.
I was making several points about this
8 per cent tax from the point of view of
the principles of taxation. I say it violates
every sound principle of taxation, and is
not in accordance with ability to pay. It
is levied upon those who have the least
ability to pay, and for whom we should have
the greatest concern, because most of them
are raising families. And of course the tax
has no relation to services rendered by the
government to individuals.
Further, this tax is beyond all reasonable
measure costly to collect. In fact, sales taxes
are among the most costly taxes for the
government. So the tax is not in accordance
with good principle, and as a form of taxation
it does harm out of all proportion to the
amount of money received.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Will my honourable friend
state his authority for saying that the sales
tax is so costly to collect?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I know it from my own
experience. I have not got the figures, if that
is what you mean, and these figures cannot
be obtained. The cost includes the expense
to which retailers and other people are put
in collecting the tax and remitting it to the
government. While I have not the detailed
figures, I say it has been estimated that it
is a very costly tax to collect.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Is the tax not collected

by the manufacturer and paid directly to
the government?
Mr. Roebuck: Yes, and pyramided when the
product gets into the hands of the retailer.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: You are all wrong.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck:

If it is paid by the

wholesaler, he makes a profit on the payment.
There is not any question that it is an expensive tax to collect.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I would say it
cheapest tax to collect.

is the

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The cost of collection is
only one of my obJections to this tax, and
I have mentioned a good many others. I
am opposed to this tax because I am in favour
cf making it easier for householders and

housewives of our country to buy the food that
they require for their families, and particularly for their children. Removal of the
tax would confer a favour upon the people
for whom we should have the greatest concern, those who are supplying food to the
tables where children eat. For these reasons.
honourable senators, I intend to vote for this
resolution.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I did not intend to take part in this debate
and I will not speak long. It seems to me
that it is much ado about nothing. I voted
for the original resolution favouring the
manufacture and sale of margarine in Canada,
and I am still in favour of that, but I am
opposed to the removal of the sales tax.
From the speech to which we have just
listened one would think that the removal
of this small tax would result in a saving
of millions of dollars to margarine consumers.
But in fact the tax amounts to only 3 cents
a pound, and as the average householder
would buy only about fifty or sixty pounds
in a year, he can make up for the amount
of the tax by smoking a few less cigars or
packages of cigarettes and drinking two or
three fewer bottles of beer.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That is the best speech
yet.
Hon. Robert W. Gladstone: Honourable
senators, we are considering a resolution of
the honourable gentleman from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), urging that margarine

neighbours in the cities of Kitchener and
Guelph, which are some fifteen miles apart
in a fine agricultural area in the province of
Ontario. I am sorry to oppose the honourable
senator, but I must do so for several reasons
-in fact, on almost every argument he has
advanced.
I am opposed to removal of the sales tax
from the standpoint of agriculture, I am
opposed to it from the standpoint of the

workingmen in the factories, I am opposed
to it from the standpoint of federal revenue;
and if more should be said, I am opposed
to it from the standpoint of what seems to
be best at this time for the fullest development of the prosperity and contentment of
Canadians as a whole.
I will use for my argument several statements taken from the speech of the honourable senator for Waterloo. After saying there
were two factors relating to margarine which
militated against consumers, he continued:
The first of these is the sales tax of 8 per cent,
which, if removed, would reduce the price to the
consumer by three cents a pound.

MAY 5, 1950
He also said:
Grocers report that the average sale per family
to the rural trade is four to six pounds per week.

And finally:
Margarine sells at from 34 to 42 cents per pound,
as against 61 and 62 cents for butter.

The last two quotations given were taken
from a Saskatchewan newspaper.
The discussion today has nothing to do with
the sale in Canada of margarine, as this is
now legalized.
According to the figures
quoted, the users of margarine have an advantage of some 20 to 28 cents per pound, this
being the difference between the price of
butter and of margarine. I believe it can be
said that those who use margarine are entirely
satisfied with this spread in price and are not
clamouring for another reduction of 3 cents
per pound. However, if the sales tax were
removed there would be a saving of 3 cents
per week to the family using one pound of
margarine, and 15 cents per week to the
family using five pounds.
It has been estimated that 73,958,000
pounds of margarine were manufactured in
Canada in 1949. Granted that in many homes
there has been a larger consumption of margarine than there previously was of butter,
the fact still remains that the use of margarine
has enormously reduced the consumption of
butter.
The honourable senator would
further discourage the farmer by reducing
the price of margarine by three cents per
pound.
We regard agriculture as the basic industry
of Canada. We have been in the habit of saying that when the farmer is prosperous there
is prosperity all around. Agriculture is by
far the largest market for the products of our
factories. Those industries that manufacture
materials for the equipment of barns and
stables-pumps, milking machines, milk
coolers, cream separators and all kinds of
seeding and harvesting machinery-depend
almost entirely on agriculture for their
market. Nearly every farm today has an
automobile, a tractor and a truck and the
supplying of these vehicles means a very
considerable output by the motor industry.
The transportation of farm produce by highway or railway creates a demand for the
products of a great variety of industries.
Even though some farmers may buy margarine, as the honourable senator for Waterloo
has stated, I cannot see the sense of giving a
slap in the face to the tillers of the soil for
the sake of a possible reduction of three cents
a pound in the price of margarine.
What would the working men in our factories think of any measure that reduced the
purchasing power of the farmers? Would the
factory employees, for the sake of a saving

of 3 cents per week on one pound of margarine, or 15 cents a week on five pounds of
margarine, support a change that would make
it still more difficult for the farmer to buy
the things which he, a working man, toils to
produce? I think he would weigh very carefully the possible saving of 15 cents per week
against the risk of losing his job through any
action that would be discouraging to the
farmer. I am sure the working men will
regard the proposal contained in the resolution as "penny wise and pound foolish".
I should like to refer to one further important consideration in the situation, namely,
of soil erosion. This is a matter of growing
concern in all parts of Canada. This spring,
wherever there are bare field one can see the
effects of water rushing down the hillsides and
tearing away valuable topsoil.
In the speech by the Honourable Senator
for Waterlo (Hon. Mr. Euler) this sentence
appears:
During previous debates in this chamber I expressed the opinion that Canada could produce
sufficient vegetable ails to make all the margarine
we could use in this country.

If that opinion is correct, the vegetable oils
would come largely from soybeans and sunflowers, which are cultivated crops. After
the harvesting of these crops nothing is left
to protect the soil against erosion. The dairy
industry supports a different type of farming.
Fodder for the herd requires pasture land,
meadows, oat and barley crops, all of which
provide protection against erosion during the
spring freshets. Farmers have recently been
discouraged from fall ploughing, in order
that this protection may be maintained as long
as possible. Dairying has always been a basic
industry, and it can be made a valuable contributing factor in soil conservation; something in which every citizen is interested
whether he lives on the farm or in the city.
I am sure that the workingmen in our
factories will weigh well the possible saving
of 15 cents per week against the risk of
unemployment through shrinkage in the
farm market. It seems to me that this is
no time to bring forward any suggestion
which will in any way be a discouragement
to our farmers.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Honourable senators,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.

Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that I
shall urge the leader of the official opposition in the other place to facilitate this

course, that time must be allowed for proper
debate on each question.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
wish to supplement what the leader opposite
has said by suggesting that the leader on
this side remind his colleagues in the House
of Commons that our rules have been
amended, and that legislation which they are
not ready to discuss can be introduced in
this house by the minister concerned. I do
not recall that a single piece of legislation
has been presented to us in that way this
session.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am happy ta have the support of the leader
opposite in this matter. It will be recalled
that when I introduced the resolution with
respect to the functions and constitution of
the standing committees, I said that I hoped
we would have the business of this house

it originates here or in the other bouse, I

suggest that we might have a joint conference to bring about that end.
There are reports abroad that parliament
will not finish its business until sometime
in July. I feel that the spreading of such
rumours is akin to certain passages in the
New Testament to the effect that certain
things were done so that the prophesies
migbt be fulfilled.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I heartily agree with
the suggestion of the honourable leader
opposite, and I shall urge the matter upon

until the end of July, and I think that other
members of parliament feel as I do.

HONOURABLE CAIRINE WILSON
FELICITATIONS ON BEING CHOSEN CANADA'S
MOTHER OF THE YEAR

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable senators, before the orders of the day
are proceeded with I should like, personally
and on behalf of all honourable members, to
compliment one of our distinguished colleagues to whom a great honour has been
paid. As Canada's Mother of the year, the
honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs.
Wilson)Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: -will receive a gold
pin from the American Mothers' Committee
in New York, which this year plans to make
awards to mothers from each of the fiftynine countries of the United Nations.
Chosen for the award by the National
Council of Women, Senator Wilson is the
first Canadian to hold the title.
This is only another in a long line of firsts
for the Senator from Rockcliffe: She was
summoned to the Senate in 1930 and was the
first woman to become a member of this
chamber. In 1949 she was made Canada's

first woman delegate to the United Nations.
Before that she was the first President of the
League of Nations Society of Canada, and
the first Chairman of Canada's National
Committee on Refugees.
I am sure that all honourable members
will join in congratulating Senator Wilson
upon this added honour. Those of us who
know well of her activities realize how
unstintingly she gives of her time and of her
great abilities to the advancement and interest of people who are in need of help. She
does this in addition to fulfilling her responsibilities as a mother; and I have no doubt
that in her role of grandparent she has additional responsibilities, although on that point
I cannot speak from experience. We all wish
her well, and hope that she may long be
spared to bestow upon those in need the
inestimable benefit of her services.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
on behalf of the senators on this side of the
house, I wish to join the leader of the government in paying tribute to the honourable
lady senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs.
Wilson). As the honourable leader has said,
she was the first lady to be summoned to the
Senate of Canada, an honour in which she
can never be superseded. The members of
this house have long known of the outstanding service of our friend on behalf of the
women of Canada. I have only once or twice
heard the criticism that she is a little too
kind-hearted, and devotes too much energy to
hielp certain people who perhaps do not need
her help.
The honourable lady senator is not only a
legislator, but a mother and a grandmother.
Unlike the leader of the government, I can
speak from experience in the matter of grandchildren, for I have a good many of them.
My wife accuses me of paying more attention
to them than I ever did to my own children,
and her accusation is no doubt justified. I
think the honourable lady senator perhaps is
subject to the same weakness.
The honourable lady has represented
Canada well in the Assembly of the United
Nations and in other organizations. Just last
week she flew to my home city of Winnipeg
to attend an important meeting there, and to
give courage to the women of that part of
Canada in the struggle which lies ahead of
them. On behalf of the women of my city,
and others who participated in the meeting,
I express thanks to our honourable colleague.
To you, madame senator, I extend from
this side of the house most hearty congratulations on the most recent distinction which has
been conferred on you.

RED RIVER FLOODS AND RIMOUSKI FIRE
EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with, I \wish to say a few words of
sympathy and regret to the many Canadian
people who are suffering from the floods in
the Red River Valley and the fire in the town
of Rimouski. I do not know that anything
we can say is adequate to show our concern
for them in their terrible plight. In such
circumstances one stands in awe of the tremendous forces of nature which seem to
defy the ability of man to control them.
I am anxious that those who have suffered,
and will continue to suffer, and those whose
relatives have lost their lives, they should
know in their suffering that they have the
sincere sympathy of the members of this
chamber.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I ask the house to permit me to extend my
remarks over a little longer time than was
occupied by the honourable leader.
First, may I say to the people of Rimouski
that we senators join with members in the
other place in promising them that nothing
that money can do to supply clothing or whatever else they lack shall remain undone.
To me, the loss of homes and belongings by
the inhabitants of Rimouski in yesterday's
fire is a heart-rending calamity. The loss
cannot be estimated in dollars; but we can
alleviate to some extent their sufferings. I

record with great pleasure that the representatives of the Red Cross are already on
the scene, that the governments of Quebec
and of Ontario have offered assistance, and
that the federal government has promised
help. I believe I speak for every member
of this house when I say that we are one
hundred per cent behind the Government of
Canada in its declared purpose to aid the
suffering people of Rimouski.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I propose to speak at greater
length about my own city of Winnipeg,
because I am better informed of the situation
there. The loss of property in the Red River
valley from Emerson to north of Winnipeg
is very great, and the effects will be serious.
In the first place it is now fairly evident
that a large acreage of agricultural land is
unfit to be cropped this year. Secondly, the
loss of livestock and the damage to buildings
and other property of farmers in the rural
areas have been very extensive.
A magnificent effort has been made by the
people of Manitoba to help those affected by
the floods, but conditions are extremely
difficult, and the situation shows no sign of
improvement.
One and one-third inches of
rain fell Friday night and Saturday morning.
At present it is raining in Winnipeg, and the
prospect is that another inch wi-ll fall tonight.
At Emerson, the principal town affected, the
water rose one foot. At 5 o'clock the water
level at Winnipeg stood at twenty-eight feet
above datum,-datum being the point reached
by the ice when it freezes in the Red River
at Winnipeg, and is calculated as of 1882.
Hitherto it bas never varied more than a
few inches. Water overflows the Red River
with a rise of eighteen feet above datum, and
as it has risen to twenty-eight feet, it is ten
feet over the banks.
Many residences in
ie
suburbs are deserted because of the
floods: in Greenwood alone at least four or
five hundred houses have been vacated; and
at 7 o'clock this evening it was announced
that all the people of Glenwood Crescent,
which is in the northern part of the city,
had been ordered to leave their homes.
I have one suggestion to make which is
directed to the problem of control of this
rampaging river. The other day, as a member of the committee presided over by the
honourable member from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), I asked the Deputy Minister of
Public Works whether the locks were open.
He replied that it was not necessary to open
them yet, because between Middlechurchwhich is fifteen miles north of Winnipegand St. Andrew's Locks, there is a natural
barrier of rock which holds back the waters,
and until they reach a certain height there

MAY 8, 1950

is no need to pay much attention to the
locks.
Hon. Mr. Howden: The gates are opened in
the fall and left open all winter.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That has nothing to do with
it. The engineer of the city of Winnipeg said
today that if these rocks were blasted out of
the river there would be no flooding at Winnipeg, nor would there be any flooding from
Ste. Agathe, which is twenty miles south of
Winnipeg. It would mean that the whole
river from Emerson north would never flood.
This operation would cost about $20 million,
but the government will have to consider
undertaking it if a stop is to be put to the
flooding of the river every time there is a
heavy rainfall or snowfall.
The flood waters have reached such proportions in Winnipeg that patients have been
removed from the St. Boniface hospital, the
King George hospital, the St. Vital Sanatorium
and the Municipal Hospital. The city itself
is not going to be deserted, and the flood
situation is being well handled; but I should
like to stress that the recurring flooding of
the Red river is something which the city of
Winnipeg or the province of Manitoba should
not have to deal with alone; it is a national
crisis which should come under the federal
authorities. If the Deputy Minister of Public
Works and the engineer of the city of Winnipeg are right, and I think they are, then
the rock blockade in the river about fifteen
miles north of Winnipeg will have to be
removed unless the river is to flood every
time there is a heavy fall of snow or rain in
southern Manitoba or in the Dakotas.
My honourable friend from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) lives in the flood area.
I was in Winnipeg two weeks ago when the
flood was coming on, and I can tell you that
it is unbelievable the way peoJple suffer. On
Saturday night a woman I know, a Mrs.
Flanders, told a tragic story of the flood. The
damage to valuable household goods is not
the worst of it; it is the terror of the water
climbing up and up. I read of one young
fellow who was drowned in his own basement. The water poured in so fast that he
did not have a chance to get out. In 1948
the flood waters in Winnipeg reached twentythree feet five inches. This year they have
already reached twenty-eight feet and are
expected to rise another two and a half feet
before the peak. All dykes have given way
except the ones guarding the St. Boniface
hospital and Norwood. The water is now
within a few feet of the corner of Main
street and Portage Avenue, the centre of the
city.
I am not hysterical about the flood situation, but I want to stir the government and

the Engineering Institute of Canada to attack
this problem. The people of the Fraser River
valley and other parts of Canada are faced
with the same problem, and our engineers
have got to try and solve it. A permanent
cure has to be found. I am not an engineer,
but I think the solution would be to remove
the rocks from the Red river north of
Winnipeg. We have cut down our timber and
removed the natural barriers against flooding.
Each year the spring waters rush through our
drainage systems to the rivers, and within a
few days we are faced with terrible floods.
Winnipeg has been badly hit, but we are
delighted to honour the people of the Red
Cross. They are doing a marvelous job, and
after this experience the people of Manitoba'
will never hesitate to contribute their full
share ta the Red Cross Society. I want to
thank the Dominion Government for sending
soldiers from Calgary, Chilliwack and other
points to Manitoba's flooded areas. They are
doing a splendid job in helping to fight the
swirling waters.
I want to thank the leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) for allowing me to make these
extended remarks.
Hon. Mr. King: The rocks are in the river
north of Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I want to express my sincere thanks to the
leader of the government for the sympathy
he has expressed to the flood victims of the
Red River Valley. This has been one of
the worst floods experienced in Canada, the
water having risen higher than it did when
the Red river flooded one hundred years ago.
When a large part of the Red River Valley .
was inundated in 1948, a foot and a half of
water came into my house and did a great
deal of damage. I repaired this damage as
best I could. Today because of the present
flood, all that can be seen of my house is
the tops of the windows. To provide shelter
for farm stock, the railway companies have
run box cars into such towns as Morris and
St. Jean. They have also brought in bales
of hay with which to feed the stock, because
the only way the farmers can get to their
own supplies is by small boats. The railways have also sent in sleeping and dining
cars to feed and house the evacuated people.
The damage done along the Red river is
beyond estimation, and I suppose it will
never be known. Cattle and chickens have
been destroyed; the damage has been terrible.
I firmly believe that this flood, like the flood
in British Columbia in 1948, constitutes a
national emergency. I would therefore ask
the leader of the Senate to convey to the
government the thoughts which have been

SENATE
.expressed here tonight. I think the federal
government should make an inquiry to ascertain what can be done to prevent a recurrence of these floods.
I aiso believe the
federal government should help to restore the
property of the Red river flood victims.
I want to express my sympathy for the
people of Rimouski. I hope the government
will do its share ta help these people ta
rebabilitate themselves.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: The honourable senator fromn The Gulf has recently passed away,
and as my constituency is close ta the city
of Rimouski, which has just been stricken by
fire, 1 want ta thank the leaders of the gaverament and the opposion for their words of
sympathy ta the people of that city.
The
last ne;vs we have had from there is terrible;
the danma-e is appalting. The fire bas taken

I think the

I wish ta thank ail honourable senaorý

I also wish ta thank themn for having
sympathized with the unfortunate city of
Rimouski.

Saturday nigbt, in Levis, I tried ta caîl
someone in Rimouski, regardîng some business in connection with the Caisse Populaire.
The onty answer I got was that the whole
city was an tire. By means of an available
broadcasting station we immediately got in
touch with Rimouski and managed, fromn
hour ta hour, ta foibow the course of the
terrible fire which bas deprived o! their
homes thousands of good citizens.
Sympathy helps a great deal; it is a great
and noble gesture. These people, however,
will need something mare tangible ta help
lhemn out of their predicament. The honourable senator fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)
bas made a suggestion which xvould prevent
a repelition of the flaoding of the Red River.
If I may ha alla ved. 1 wauld like ta submit
the follo\wing thougbt ta the gavernment:
Yestcrday, the insurance agents of the
Caisses Populaires were in Rimouski, the
scene a! tbe disaster, ta estirnate the damage
and pay out immediately the sums of money
required ta re-establish the badly stricken
people of that city. Unfortunately, they will
not bave the necessary funds ta even start

Therefore, t urge the Central

MARGARINE-REMOVAL

OF TAX

MOTION

The Senate resumed from Friday, May 5,
the adjourned debate on the motion of the
Honourable Senator Euler, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Lambert, that in the
opinion of the Senate margarine should be
added to the list of foods which are exempt
from the sales tax of 8 per cent.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable senators, I assure you that I shall not take much
time this evening in opposing the motion to
remove the sales tax on margarine. I object
to the motion, in the first place, on the ground
that the mover, the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has not given
sufficient reason why the sales tax should be
abolished. He seems to be as much concerned
about the legislation which prohibits manufacturers from colouring margarine as he is
to have the 8 per cent sales tax removed. He
read in support of his argument a long article
from a journal published in Atlanta, Georgia.
He said that the political influence of the dairy
group is extraordinarily disproportionate to its
political strength. Further, he stated that the
Legislature of Ontario had enacted a law
which in effect forbids the colouring of margarine, and that the measure was supported
by practically all the members of that legislature excepting two Communists. I am sure
he would not expect members of the Senate
to associate themselves with those two members.
The question is, who would benefit most by
having the manufacturers colour margarine in
Canada? I presume that the chief beneficiaries
would be Lever Brothers, Canada Packers,
Swift's, Standard Brands, and other such
firms. This measure would not in any way
reduce the cost of margarine to purchasers
of that product.
May I point out that if, when margarine
was first manufactured in this country, those
who produced it had coloured it green, the
housewife would have known just what she
was buying and the dairyman would not have
objected. Why is it desired that it should
resemble butter? Personally I am content to
leave the question of the sales tax in the
capable hands of the Minister of Finance and
his able associates.
In the second place, I am opposed to any
change in the law which would adversely
affect the dairy industry of this country. The
Dairymen's organizations are doing everything
possible to give the consuming public the best
butter that can be produced. Creameries are
installing power packaging machines to put
butter in one-pound containers which will
replace the two-pound flat package. Creameries are inspected; every can of cream which
goes to the factory is tested; all second-grade
55950-19&

cream is returned; the price of butter has been
reduced to 53 cents per pound wholesale;
while the farmers' costs continue to increase.
For the information of honourable senators
and the public at large, I propose to place on
the record the average monthly wholesale
jobbing prices from 1914 to 1949 of creamery
butter No. 1, pasteurized, at Montreal. I select
for this purpose the month of May, because
we are now in that month. The average price
for the thirty-six years mentioned was 32
cents per pound.
(See appendix at end of today's report.)
I have also calculated the wholesale jobbing
prices during the war years 1939 to 1945: the
average is less than 31 cents per pound. It is
evident that the price paid during this period
by the public was very reasonable. But for
the controls exercised by the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board, butter would have cost at
least a dollar per pound.
As you know, the business of dairying goes
on seven days a week; yes, three hundred and
sixty-flive days in the year. The dairy farmer
must give continual attention to his work; and
the small dairy farmers, who constitute the
great proportion of those in the business, are
working under exceptional difficulties, because
if they hire help they frequently lose it on
Sundays, and are forced to do the work alone.
At this point I desire to make a brief
statement concerning the effects upon the
province of Prince Edward Island of the
reduction in the price of butter. In the year
ended December 31, 1949, 6,935 patrons supplied the creameries with 13,009,196 pounds of
cream, from which 4,838,114 pounds of butter were manufactured. The gross value of
this butter was $2,938,742.87.
Relatively
speaking this is not a large sum, but it is very
important to the farmers who produce the
cream.
Dairy farmers also go in for mixed farming,
and grow potatoes. This year's total shipments of potatoes to the end of April were
10,060 cars; in April 1,415 cars were shipped.
Table stock potatoes sold at 50 cents for
seventy-five pounds. The farmers' operations
in potatoes this year are "in the red". However, they are providing a good, cheap, wholesome food for our poorer families, in whose
welf are ail honourable senators are interested.
The industry also provides work for railway men and others who are receiving union
pay. At a time when organized labour in
this country is in receipt of the highest
wages in its history, the farmers' income
is slightly lower than it was in 1948.
The union men claim that the employers
have to lay aside money to superannuate old.
machines and replace them with new ones,
so they argue they should also provide foi:
the workers when they too are worn out at

SENATE
the age of 65. At the age of 65 Ford employees receive a pension of $55 per month.
This means that there will be an additional
charge against Ford machinery which the
farmer will have to pay when he purchases
a farm tractor, plow, harrow, truck, motor
car or Ford parts. The farmer will pay this
charge without receiving any benefit from it.
I think we should all be proud of the
farmer. In seed-time he does not know what
prices he will get in harvest-time, but he
continues to sow and reap and gather in
the harvest. He sells his product for low
prices when times are bad, and for high
prices when times are good. Because of this
he has come to be known as the backbone
of the country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. P. Howden: Honourable senators,
in rising to support the measure presented
to this chamber by the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), I can hardly
hope to equal in brevity the speech delivered
the other day by the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
Before entering into a discussion of the
subject matter of the motion, I should like
to voice my welcome to the new senator
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Isnor). For a number
of years we both sat as members of another
place, and during that time we were always
good friends. I have always cherished a
sincere respect and warm personal regard
for the honourable gentleman, and I have
had the temerity to hope that this feeling
was mutual. I look back with pleasant
memories to the many, warm, brotherly
friendships I enjoyed while a member of the
other house, not only with those of my own
group but with those of other groups as
well, and I am happy that Senator Isnor
is amongst us now.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Now, margarine, like
butter-for which it serves as a substituteis composed of fat. Fat in turn is almost
wholly carbon, and as coal and firewoodwhich are also carbon-feed the fires that
heat our homes, fat is the fuel that feeds
the fire of physical life and supplies us
with heat and energy. But, you say, many
people eat little or no fat; how about that?
As many of you know very well, our bodiesall physical bodies-may be likened to chemical laboratories, and they have the property
of being able to arrange food substances in
such a way that there is always a preponderance of fat for body use. Proteins break
down three ways and starches break down two
ways, but fat is always fat. It is burned as
such and furnishes the real fuel of animal

existence. Without fat we could not survive.
I labour this matter only to show that fat is a
real food and a very important one.
Now, margarine, being a substitute for
butter with which it compares favourably,
enters into competition with butter but costs
about one-third less. For this reason, in the
interest of the butter-makers it has been penalized in the food market by an 8 per cent
tax. Furthermore, in an added effort to
retard the sale of margarine, its makers have
been forbidden to use the same colouring
matter that is used in butter. This prohibition has been imposed by the government at
the instance of and for the benefit of the
butter-maker.
Honourable senators, I have always been
a Liberal, and I believe in Liberal principles,
the first considetation of which is fairness to
all. If, then, food must be taxed in this
country for revenue, let us not start on the
poor man's food, but tax luxuries and the
less necessary articles first; if we must tax
n cessary foods, let us tax them all. There
will always be many people who prefer butter
to margarine, and who can and will have
it. It is said that competition is the life
of trade, and if butter-makers cannot meet the
makers of margarine in fair competition, the
milk producers need not despair, for they
still have a huge milk market, which is the
best paying market. In addition to this
there are the markets for cheese and 'or
evaporated and powdered milk, and into these
markets the margarine makers cannot follow.
Consistency is a wonderful thing. So let
us be consistent. The tax on margarine is not
a tax for revenue, but a penalty upon the
makers of margarine, a class privilege, a protective measure in the interests of the butter-makers, imposed at the expense of the
hundreds of thousands of the poorer, more
humble Canadians who use margarine today,
and it is a discredit to the administration that
placed it on the use of margarine.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, I am not going to make a speech; I am
just going to make a few remarks. The
honourable member from St. Boniface (Hon.
Mr. Howden) has just told the house that
consistency is a wonderful thing. But tonight I am going to be very inconsistent.
That is why I am rising to my feet.
On three different occasions I supported
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) when he tried to get through a
motion to remove the ban on the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in Canada.
We did not succeed in our endeavour, but
eventually a ruling by the Supreme Court
of Canada made the sale and manufacture

MAY 8, 1950
of oleomargarine lawful. Now, while I have
not the slightest doubt about the sincerity
of purpose of the honourable senators from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) and Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), who have moved and seconded
the resolution before the house, I do not think
I can support it because there is no demand
whatsoever for the removal of the 8- per cent
sales tax on margarine. When I was home
in Kingston over the week-end I decided
to find out if there was any public demand
for the removal of the 3 cents per pound
sales tax on this product. Saturday morning
I went out on the street and interviewed
fifteen different people. I said to each of them:
"Do you buy margarine?" The answer was
always yes. Then I asked them: "What is the
sales tax on a pound of margarine?" One
man replied that he thought it was 8 per cent;
another man said he thought it was 8j per
cent, and thirteen people did not even know
there was such a thing at all. However, the
one man who thought the sales tax was
8j per cent told me he did not object to the
extra three cents a pound that this added to
the price of margarine, but he did not like
having to mix colouring into the product.
And although the motion has nothing to do
with colouring, I agree with him. I do not
see any reason why margarine should not be
coloured when sold. It is marketed in a
package that is plainly labelled, and I doubt
that anyone would be deceived by colour
into buying margarine when he intended to
buy butter, or vice versa.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would my honourable friend
answer a question? Why does he want to
have margarine coloured at all?
Hon. Mr. Davies: Well, simply because I
think that the coloured product looks more
palatable on the table. And, after all, butter
has to be coloured, does it not?
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Sometimes.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I am speaking as one who,
so far as I know, has never tasted margarine;
but others have told me that they do not
like having to mix the colouring into it, and
I cannot see any real reason why they should
have to do this.
However, I am not suppoiting the motion,
because I do not believe there is any demand
at present for elimination of the sales tax
on margarine. Furthermore, while this tax
does result in an extra three cents a pound
in the price to consumers, it must not be
forgotten that the majority of these consumers are enjoying far higher wages now
than they were a year ago, and it is not
likely that this three cents a pound is causing
them any hardship.

Another reason why I am not supporting
the motion is that I am afraid the whole
benefit from removal of the sales tax would
not be passed on to the consumer. Margarine
is made by very large companies, and if the
tax were removed the retail price might at
first be dropped by 3 cents a pound, but I
should not be a bit surprised to find before
long that it had gradually crept up until the
price became as high as it was before the tax
was removed.
I was much impressed by what the honourable senator from Wellington South (Hon.
Mr. Gladstone) said when speaking to this
motion last Friday afternoon. He reminded
us that dairy farmers and all other farmers
today are buyers of agricultural implements
-milking machines, cream separators, harvesting machinery and so on-as well as
automobiles, tractors and trucks, the manufacture of which gives employment to many
thousands of people in our cities.
I supported the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) in his three
efforts to have margarine made available to
the Canadian people, but I think that we have
now gone about far enough in this respect.
There is a feeling that if the sales tax on
margarine were removed the dairy farmer
might suffer because of increased competition.
At Kingston on May 6, 1949, the retail price
of butter in the stores was 62 cents a pound,
and margarine was 38 cents. Last Saturday
the respective prices were 55 or 56 cents a
pound and 35 cents. I am told by four of
the large chain stores in Kingston that since
its introduction a year ago the sales of margarine have cut into butter sales in that city
by between 15 and 20 per cent. I imagine
that is fairly serious to butter-makers, and it
seems to me that we should not pass a motion
of this kind unless there is a strong demand
for it from the consuming public.
While nobody likes taxes, the government
has got to get money somewhere. I do not
agree with my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that this
sales tax is vicious and repressive, for I think
it is neither. We must remember that
Canada's annual payments for family allowances are now $300 million, the bulk of which
money is no doubt going to people in the
lower income brackets. Considerable sums
have to be found also to take care of the
unemployed. The monthly average of unemployed persons in Kingston during the winter
was 950, and the monthly cost of taking care

SENATE
of them was $40,000. Some 140 of these persons were added to our list because of having
become eligible under the amendment made
to the Unemployment Insurance Act last
year.
As I have pointed out, I supported the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) in his endeavours to have the manufacture, importation and sale of margarine in
Canada legalized, but much as I admire him

and the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), who seconded the present
motion, I cannot vote in favour of it.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

THE SENATE
Tuesday, May 9, 1950
The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
NEW SENATOR INTRODUCED
The following newly-appointed senator was
introduced and took his seat:
Hon. Charles G. Hawkins, of Milford
Station, Nova Sceotia, introduced by Hon.
Wishart McL. Robertson and Hon. J. A.
McDonald.
CONVENTION OF NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION

Hon. W. D. Euler moved:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by .the United States of America of a Convention of delegates from the democracies which
sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty and representing the principal political parties of such democracles, for the purpose of exploring how far their
peoples and the peoples of such other democracies
as the Convention may invite to send delegates,
can apply among them within the framework of the
United Nations, the principles of federal union.

He said: Honourable senators, the resolution which stands in my name will not, I am
sure, provoke as much opposition or be as
controversial as some others which I have
submitted from time to time to this chamber.
This motion concerns itself with the most
important issue in the world: the maintenance of the peace of the world. It contemplates also in its implications that if war
should come the democracies could successfully resist any attack which might be made
against them. The resolution, if adopted, will
commit the Senate to approval of a conference of the fourteen nations now comprised
in the Atlantic pact. The purpose of the
conference is to explore proposals of federal
union. Just what form such a union would
take, no one can say at this time. It would
certainly involve such matters as defence,
currency, taxation, and perhaps migration
from one part of the world to another, the
making of laws, tariffs and so forth. In my
opinion the purpose of such a federation
should be not only the union of the western
nations for the purposes of defence, but a
complete merging of these countries, politically, economically, and in every other way.
The ultimate objective should be the federal
union of all the countries of the world,
including even those beyond the Iron Curtain.

The union of what we call the western
democracies may be regarded as visionary
enough. The union of these with the communist countries may be regarded as quite
impossible. Those of us, however, who in
the last twenty-five to fifty years have witnessed the seemingly impossible become
actual-the political changes, the changes in
national boundaries between various countries in Europe, the developments of science,
warlike and otherwise, including the atomic
bomb-must admit that dreams do come
true, and that the logic of events may force
the nations together as a matter of selfpreservation, and make them realize that
they should not wait until it is too late. A
prominent American industrialist once wrote,
"The things that are difficult we shall do
right away; the impossible may take a little
longer".
What is the alternative to a federation of
the nations of the world, even though there
should be no shooting war? It will mean a
constant fear of war, and a continuation of
the enormous expenditure now necessitated
by the cold war and the need for protection
against possible attack. Canada alone is
spending more than $400 million a year for
defence purposes, a sum larger than our
whole national debt before the First Great
War. The United States is spending something like $16 billion or $17 billion a year
in military preparations, while Russia is
spending a still larger proportion of its
national income for the same purpose.
Countries like Britain and France are finding
it very difficult to carry the heavy financial
load which they think necessary to provide
for defence. Even if there were no danger
of a war between the nations holding the two
great ideologies, the concept of a world
union or, for the time being, a half-world
union, strongly appeals to me. I mean a
union in which citizens of France, Australia,
Canada, the United States, or of any other
member country, would be citizens of the
world, just as a citizen of Ontario is a citizen
of Canada.
There will always be danger of war so long
as nations maintain their own jealous
sovereignties. We know from our reading of
history that alliances never prevent wars.
In more recent days the alliance of France
with Poland and Czechoslovakia did not prevent war, nor did the old alliance between
France and Russia. The alliance of Germany,
Italy and Japan-the Axis nations-did not
prevent war; in fact, it may have tended to
provoke war. The old League of Nations, to
which I was a delegate in Geneva in 1929,
failed because action had to be unanimously
approved, and there was no means of carrying out the league's decrees.

SENATE
The United Nations Organization is inadequate for the same reason and because of the
veto.
No normal person wants war. That, I
think, is true of the masses of the people in
every country of the world. It is the leaders
who carry them astray. But war comes
essentially because there are no world laws
to which all nations and peoples willingly
subject themselves, as they do now to the
laws of their own individual countries. Surely
that would argue for some sort of union or
federation controlling the things which apply
to all of them.
Ever since civilization began the whole
trend has been towards merging of the small
into the large. This has resulted frequently
in autocracies, dictatorships and dictatorial
empires; but in more recent times, there
has been the federation of warring states and
principalities in Italy, France and Germany.
We are all familiar with the formation of
the British Commonwealth, the federation of
the provinces of Canada, of the states of
Australia, and the union of the provinces of
South Africa. Most notable of ail, has been
the federation of the thirteen states which,
though often quarreling among themselves,
set up a republic that now embraces fortyeight states and forms what is, without doubt,
the most powerful and prosperous nation in
the world, the United States of America. The
most recent example of all is the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics.
In the worst days of the war the Prime
Minister of Britain, Mr. Churchill, proposed
complete organic and political union of his
country with France. Today negotiations are
proceeding for the federation of Western
Europe, in which, in my opinion, Germany
must be included if the federation is to have
any chance of success. There is in my mind
now, and has been for some years, the conviction that the greatest peril to Europe and
to the world would result if, by mismanagement or bad judgment on the part of the
Allies, the German people, with their resourcefulness, their thrift, their scientific
knowledge and their genius for organization,
projected themselves wholeheartedly into the
communistic system. I should think that if
they were to join with Russia, the position of
the other nations of western Europe would
be desperate.
But at the moment, even the proposal for
a western European federation is more or less
eclipsed by the great interest being shown
in an Atlantic Union, which I am discussing
today. Obviously the United States must
take the lead in so momentous a project.
The resolution before us today is in almost the
same terms as one which was introduced in

the United States Senate by Senator Kefauver, and which is now being considered
in a subcommittee of the United States
Senate's Committee on External Affairs. And
there is a similar resolution in the United
States House of Representatives.
Recently I had a communication from Mr.
Clarence Streit, the courageous and persistent
founder of the federation movement. I
should have liked to quote briefly from his
letter, but I find that I neglected to bring
it with me. He says there is a reasonable
hope that the United States Congress will
pass this year the resolution which is similar
to the one we are now considering. It is
claimed that more than one hundred representatives and more than twenty senators
support the movement. I also want to mention a letter that I received from Mr. Henry
Usborne, a member of the British Parliament.
I do this simply to indicate how widespread
the movement is, although, much to my
regret, apparently no great interest has been
taken in it by Canadians. I do not know
Mr. Usborne, and his letter to me was
unsolicited. He wrote this:
I am with you entirely in believing that the only
final solution of our problem lies in organic political
union, beginning probably with half the world and
ending ultimately and certainly with world federation. Frankly, I do not believe there is now any
alternative, and although most politicians believe
that this solution is still Utopian and very far off,
I myself think now that it is much more urgent than
is generally assumed. At any rate, it is certainly
most important that some of us consistently and
vigorously draw attention to this ultimate goal.
It would also greatly help us if those in different
countries who take this line could keep closely in
touch with each other and try as far as possible to
co-ordinate activities.
In the parliament at Westminster there are over
100 M.P.'s who have supported resolutions which
are aimed at full political union.

Expressions of opinion favouring Atlantic
federation or world federation, or modifications of these, are on record from the Prime
Minister of France, the Foreign Minister of
France, the Prime Minister of Britain, the
Foreign Secretary of Britain, Mr. Churchill,
Mr. Eden and Sir William Beveridge. In the
United States, prominent men favouring the
union are Mr. Einstein, former Chief Justice
Roberts, former Foreign Secretary Mr. Byrnes,
and Senator Kefauver-who is sponsoring the
resolution in the Senate-Senator Lehman,
Mr. Dulles-a Republican-Dr. Urey-of
whom we have read recently-and former
Assistant Secretary of State Mr. Will Clayton.
Supporters in other parts of the world are Mr.
Smuts, the former Prime Minister of South
Africa, and Mr. Hofmeier, who I think was
Foreign Secretary or Assistant Foreign Secretary of that country. And in Canada support has been given by Mr. Mackenzie King,
Mr. Bracken, and Mr. MacInnis, who spoke

MAY 9, 1950
for the C.C.F. in the absence of Mr. Coldwell.
The crusade has begun in Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France and Great
Britain.
From the point of view of Canada, I regard
as significant an extract from a speech delivered just a few days ago in Hamilton by Mr.
Pearson, our Minister of External Affairs.
Speaking of certain problems, he is reported
to have said:
In working out these problemas, in attempting to
reconcile these different interests, we can, I think,
use our North Atlantic pact. It may provide the
foundation for a great co-operative economic commonwealth of the western world-which one day
may become a political commonwealth. You may
say that this is unrealistic nonsense, but I suggest
that in this jet-propelled, atomic age, no plan less
than this will be adequate, no vision less than this
will do.
There will of course be objections to this
movement and possibly certain criticisms
will be voiced in this chamber. Naturally in
such a federation there must be a surrender
of the sovereignty which seems to be so dear
to most nations but which, after ail, is valued
more because of sentiment than because of its
real importance to the individual. I should
think that citizenship in a world federationor even in a half-world federation-is more
desirable than citizenship in a single state
which, by reason of its isolation, lives in constant fear of war and possible annihilation.
The realization of this conception of world
government, or of Atlantic union, if you like,
will not come in a day; but I believe there is
a definite urgency, and that Canada, as a
country which is a living example of successful federation, should do all it can to promote
the realization of this ideal.
In the budget debate of last year I made
some observations on this subject. My colleague from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) followed in an excellent iaddress. A few weeks
ago the eloquent senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David) made a most interesting and valuable
contribution on the same subject. Unfortunately, neither the Senate as a whole nor
the press of Canada paid much attention to
the proposal for a conference.
The motion before the Senate is made in
the hope that senators will discuss it fully
and that the press wrn give it some, at least,
of the attention it deserves. Further, I hope
that the motion will be accepted by the Senate,
and later by the House of Commons. If it is
adopted by the Parliament of Canada it will
serve to encourage those in the United States
who are trying so hard to bring this conference about.
In conclusion: if peace in a so-called
Christian and civilized world cannot be preserved by an active application of the principle of the brotherhood of man, surely the
55950-20

nations that think alike, that live alike, that
believe in freedom, must unite in order to
survive, and should take steps to that end
before another disastrous war sends the world
into chaos.
I conclude with the words of Lord Russell,
better known as Bertrand Russell:
Whatever we do, we shall be united, and it Is
better to be united in a comnon salvation than in
a common death."
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: I have great pleasure in
seconding the resolution so well moved by
my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler).
On motion of Hon. Mr. Crerar the debate
was adjourned.

MARGARINE-REMOVAL

OF TAX

MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Euler, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Lambert, that in the
opinion of the Senate margarine should be
added to the list of foods which are exempt
from the sales tax of 8 per cent.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
may I first be permitted to welcome to this
house our two new colleagues from Nova
Scotia (Hon. Mr. Isnor and Hon. Mr.
Hawkins).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I have yet to meet a
new member from the Maritime Provinces
who has not been extremely friendly, cooperative and a good worker, and I wish both
these gentlemen the greatest success in their
new career. I can assure them that they are
most welcome in the work that they are
going to share with us.
I should also like to congratulate the honourable senator from-I do not know whether
I should say Waterloo or Kitchener-

Hon. Mr. Euler: Waterloo.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: -the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) on the
motion that he has just presented. In the
last two weeks he has passed from a petty
national matter to one of international proportions. I must admit that I am more
inclined to agree with him in international
matters than in national affairs.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I expected that.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: When my honourable
friend from Waterloo presented his motion
for the removal of the sales tax of 8 per cent
on margarine, his main argument was that it
would lower the cost of this commodity to
the consumer.
The saving, at the most
optimistic estimate, would be 3 cents a pound;
in reality it would be only 2ý cents a pound,
if that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not like to interrupt
my friend, but while that was one of my
arguments, my main contention was that there
should not be discrimination against one
article of food.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I shall come to that in
a few minutes. At first sight it looks very
humanitarian to equalize the conditions of the
sale of food. I am surprised to see, however,
that this humanitarian outlook is limited to
the sales tax on margarine, which in the end
would mean a saving, per consumer, of about
only 50 cents a year. If one looks into our
statutes one soon finds that many other commodities more necessary than margarine to
the life of Canadians are heavily taxed. If
the taxes were removed from these commodities the benefit to Canadian consumers would
be much greater than would be brought
about by the removal of this 8 per cent tax
on margarine. One only needs to look at
the Customs Act to find that coffee, tea, salt,
cereals, fruits, sugar, drugs and textiles are
very heavily taxed.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Through tariffs on imports.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That is what I say-

in the Customs Tariff Act.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, but not through a
sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I find that tea, coffee,
sugar, and all kinds of drugs, medicines and
textiles are also subject to the 8 per cent
sales tax.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not sugar.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Sugar too. I looked into

the situationHon. Mr. Euler: So did I.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: -yesterday, and found
that there is no special exemption on sugar,

MAY 9, 1950
any more than there is on tea, coffee and
textiles. Although these items are not all
edible, they are extremely important to the
poor of our country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I would say that there
is no similarity between the amount of money
an average family spends on these items in
a year and the amount they spend on margarine. I have come to the conclusion that
an ordinary family, using an average amount
of margarine, would not save more than $1
per year.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What does the average
family save now on ice cream?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not know, but I
claim it is ridiculous to try to get the sales
tax on margarine removed when we do not
try to remove the tax on other articles of
greater necessity and importance to the poor
of our country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If the sales tax were
removed from textiles it would mean a saving
of $8 per year to the average family, because
the average family spends about $100 a year
on such material%. This saving does not even
take into account what is paid out in customs
duties on the importation of textiles, and the
enormous profits that go into the hands of
the manufacturing companies because of the
high tariffs to which those textiles are subject when they come into Canada. If the
spirit of humanity is the motive behind this
motion, why has such a small item as margarine been singled out, as though it were
the most important taxed commodity?
I have a great deal of confidence in the
proposer of this motion, and I am sure that
once he realises the very small advantage that
would accrue to the poor consumer, he might
change his motion and in place of margarine
substitute some other commodity which is
more important to our daily Canadian life,
and thus benefit the consumer to a much
greater extent.
Before going into the merits of this particular motion, I would point out to honourable
senators that the price of margarine varied
considerably in 1949. In February of that
year, the retail price was 45 cents a pound,
and by December 1949 it had dropped to 33.4
cents, a variation of 12 cents per pound. In
the United States, where there is a great deal
more competition in the manufacture of
margarine than in CanadaHon. Mr. Euler: There is plenty in Canada.
55950-201

Hon. Mr. Bouffard:-the price per pound of
margarine during the same period ranged
from a maximum of 36.3 cents to a minimum
of 28-1 cents.
Before agreeing to vote in favour of this
motion I would certainly ask that the government of Canada should first give its assurance that the consumers would get the benefit
if the sales tax on margarine were removed.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Why should the price
of margarine vary to such an extent in the
space of eleven months? My impression isand I think it is the impression of many
people in Canada-that the manufacturers
and retailers of margarine have varied their
price in order to get the highest price possible
from the consumer. I maintain that if the
tax were removed, the benefit of 3 cents or
21 cents would soon disappear in the variation of price something about which nobody
would have any say: If the tax is removed,
the first thing that the government should do
is to take some measures to ensure that the
full benefit of the removal is passed on to
the consumer. I do not know just what
measures should be taken but perhaps an
inquiry should be made into the cost of producing margarine and a ceiling price established. Suppose, for instance, that the tax
had been removed in December 1949. What
would the result have been? The consumer
would have got margarine that month at 33-1
cents a pound, but a month later, in January
1950, he would have paid 34.6 cents. Why?
Well, who has ever explained the variations in
the price of this commodity? And who can
assure the consumer that if the sales tax
were removed he would get the benefit? I
say again that if the tax is removed the
first thing that the government should do is to
take proper measures against the manufacturers, so that the amount saved by the lifting
of the tax will be taken off the price charged
to the consumer.
Before going into the merits of the motion
may I summarize the two reasons that I have
so far given for my intention to vote against
the motion? First, from the point of view of
benefit to the consumer, there are more important commodities from which the sales tax
would be removed. Second, we have no
assurance that if the tax were removed from
margarine the consumer would benefit.
Now, honourable senators, in going into
the merits of the motion, may I recall that
in 1947 and 1948 I voted against the bill
proposed by the honourable senator from
Waterloo for the removal of the ban on
the production and distribution of margarine
in Canada. Looking into the situation now,
I certainly would not be led to change my

SENATE
mind, for the situation created by the removal
of that ban is a very unhappy and pitiful
one.
The removal of the ban on margarine bas
resulted in keen competition against one of
our greatest national industries, buttermaking, in which more than twelve hundred
manufacturers are engaged. This great industry has a yearly production of approximately $200 million, uses eight billion pounds
of milk annually and, in its many stages of
manufacture and transport distributes hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages to
employees. This competition the dairy industry .cannot meet, and this is regrettable
because the dairy industry is the pivot of our
farmers' financial stability.
I am not interested in the dairy industry,
nor am I interested in the manufacture of
margarine or of any other thing. And I
am not a protectionist, in the real sense
of the word. Howevet, I think that our
Canadian industry should be protected in a
just and equitable manner. If I am far from
approving the heavy duties imposed upon the
importation of some articles for the sole
profit and advantage of some over-protected
industries, I am nevertheless convinced that
a limited protection of what is necessary
for the proper function and operation of our
Canadian industry is sound policy and should
be maintained. I find it definitely unreasonable to impose upon our dairy industry a
competition which it cannot meet and which
will result in the discouragement of our
farmers and the ruin of their main industry.
I find it unreasonable and unfair that
although practically all other industries in
Canada are, to say the least, heavily protected
and, in most cases, over-protected, yet equitable protection is refused to the farmers,
who have to contribute heavily to the cost
of the protection granted other industries.
Such a policy is unsound, for it imposes upon
a very important class of our people the
obligation to pay for a protection which is
not granted to it. And I want to raise my
voice again, as I did in 1947 and 1948, to
call attention of the government to the need
for adopting a policy which will give our
farmers and our dairy industry adequate
protection.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I shall not go over
all the arguments that were advanced in the
course of the discussions that took place in
this house in 1947 and 1948. However, I
will mention one of the arguments that struck
me most, which was to the effect that
producers of margarine would not have to
go outside the country to purchase the oil
entering into the manufacture of the product.

It was several times contended that the manufacture of margarine in our country would
be of great advantage to our farmers, in
that they would produce enough oil for the
entire Canadian manufacture of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It was said that they
could; not that they would.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It was said not only
that they could, but that they would, and
that no oil would have to be imported into
Canada for the manufacture of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would my friend tell me
who said that?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: My honourable friend
from Waterloo said it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You are absolutely incorrect, and I am putting it mildly.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I will accept my honourable friend's word. I may be mistaken.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, you are.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I may have misunderstood what he said, but only today I was
looking at a newspaper that reproduced
exactly what he said in 1947 and 1948. Unfortunately I have not got the paper before
me at the moment, and it may be that I did
not read it correctly; but I certainly received
the impression that Canada would not have
to import oil for the production of margarine.
In fact, I was left under the impression at
the time, in 1948, that the quantity of oil
in Canada was even then sufficient for the
production of margarine, and that none
would have to be imported. I may have
misunderstood my honourable friend's statement, and if so I think a good many of my
colleagues also misunderstood it. Anyway,
I accept his word that he did not go so far
as that. I should very much like, though,
to have the newspaper that is now in my
office, for I think it would show that I was
not mistaken.
It was from what I understood of the
proposition made at that time that I concluded that the removal of the ban on margarine, far from resulting in competition
between a Canadian and a foreign product,
would bring about a legitimate competition
between two Canadian products, quite open
to free enterprise in Canada and using
Canadian materials. It seems to me that I
heard that argument in 1947 and 1948.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I did, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: So did I. I am fairly
certain that some argument of that kind was
propounded, and if it was not exactly that,
it was so close to it as to be equivalent to it.

MAY 9, 1950
Well, what has been the result of removal
of the ban on margarine? In 1949 approximately 80 to 90 per cent of the oil used in
Canada was imported from the United States
of America. In other words, barely 10 to 20
per cent of the oil used by Canadian marwas produced in
garine manufacturers
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Now we know where
some of our dollars are going.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes.
As a result, the competition which the dairy
industry has to meet is not national in
character; it is a competition between the
Canadian dairy industry and a margarine
industry which uses material brought from
the United States of America.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Terrible!
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is terrible when
one remembers that to promote competition
from a foreign source, the Canadian people
will have to pay a deficit on butter of
$1,000,000.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I interrupt the
speaker a moment to say that I do not believe
the proportion of domestic oils used in the
manufacture of margarine in Canada is more
than 1 per cent of the total oil content. That
at least, is my information. I challenge anybody to prove that the percentage is any
higher.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You two had better get
together.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I think my honourable
friend will find that more than two of us
will get together in opposition to this motion.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am referring to your
percentages.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am not an expert
on that matter, but I have a great deal of
confidence in the honourable senator from
Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald), whose statement we have just heard. I want to emphasize that the competition which our dairy
industry has to meet is largely from another
country, and I am absolutely against any
competition with one of our products by an
article composed of materials imported from
elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, dear!
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: What was the result of
last year's operations? During the first three
months of 1941 there were 11 million pounds
of margarine sold in Canada. By the end of
the year the consumption had increased to 74
million pounds.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Seventy-four millions? '
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Actually 73,900,000
pounds. I was giving round figures. And
remember, in two provinces the consumption
of margarine is forbidden. But in the first
three months of 1950 27 million pounds of
margarine were sold in comparison with 11
million pounds sold in the same period last
year. It may reasonably be assumed, then,
that during the present year the consumption
of margarine in Canada will amount to 125
million pounds.
Now, what was the effect on butter?
Hon. Mr. Euler: What was the effect on the
consumer?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: During 1949 the consumption of butter steadily decreased. So
grave was the situation that in the course of
that year the government decided to come to
the rescue of the industry, and purchased 20
million pounds of butter at 62 cents per pound.
Of this quantity, the government still holds
over 10 million pounds, on which it stands to
lose from 7 to 10 cents per pound. Who must
bear this loss? Nobody but the Canadian taxpayer. He will have to meet a deficit created,
to a large extent, through the necessity of
protecting butter from the competition of a
product which consists mainly of foreign
materials.
Is such a policy sound? Has the result of
the removal of the ban on margarine proved
satisfactory? Can any Canadian conclude
that the consequences in 1949 were not disastrous? Already the government has been
obliged to purchase 20 million pounds of butter and thereby incur a loss to the taxpayers
of over $1 million. Are these obligations now
to be increased through giving a greater competitive advantage to margarine?
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It seems to me, considering these circumstances, that not only
should the tax on margarine not be removed,
but that the duties on its ingredients should
be increased.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The honourable senator from Waterloo has argued that the results
of permitting the manufacture of margarine
have been beneficial to the farmers. No doubt
farmers have benefited to some extent, but
they have done so at the expense of the taxpayers of this country. But for the price paid
by the governrment for 20 million pounds of
butter the producers would have been without a market. They sold their butter to the
government at the then current price, and
purchased margarine for use in their own

SENATE
homes. Who pays for that transaction? The
margarine producers? No, the taxpayers of
Canada, and to the extent of over $1 million.
An operation of that kind cannot be repeated
indefinitely.
How long will the Canadian people consent
to meet these deficits in order to permit a
few manufacturers of margarine to place their
product on the market at a price with which
the dairy industry cannot compete? I am
absolutely opposed to such a policy. I do
not- blame the farmers. They have a hard
time. When I was young I knew of some
farmers who sold their butter and bought
margarine for the household, to be able to
raise their families and put a little aside for
their old age. Who is the farmer today who
would refuse to sell his butter to the government at 62 cents a pound when he can buy
margarine for from 35 to 40 cents a pound?
So long as the government is willing to continue that policy and the taxpayers are foolish
enough to pay for it, farmers will buy margarine, sell their butter, and retain the profits,
as they are entitled to do. As far as the
province of Quebec is concerned, I can assure
my honourable colleagues that, were the distribution of margarine in that province permissible, the amount of butter which the
government would have had to buy would
have been much greater, and the quantity of
margarine sold on the Canadian market would
have been substantially increased.
I come now to another point which I regard
as extremely important. One might have
thought that our manufacturers would have
bought oil on the Canadian market for their
manufacture of margarine. Just a few months
ago we were told that oil produced in Canada
would be used for this purpose. But what
has been the experience in the past year?
Canadian manufacturers of margarine have
imported American oil at approximately 16
cents a pound, in preference to purchasing
available Canadian oil at 12I cents a pound.
The producers of margarine were offered seal
oil at a price equivalent to what they were
paying for oil on the American market.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What kind of oil?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Seal oil, first class.
Hon. Mr. Euler: American seal oil?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No, Canadian seal oil.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am not trying to interrupt my friend, but is he trying to make a
comparison between seal oil in Canada and
vegetable oil in the United States?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They are different kinds
of oil.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Seal oil can be used for
the production of margarine, just as vegetable oil can be used.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, but it does not produce the same kind of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The Canadian producers of margarine ignored the fact that
there was oil in Canada which could be used
for the making of margarine, and they purchased oil on the American market at 16
cents a pound. What offer did they make to
the Canadian oil manufacturers? They did
not tell them that their oil was no good or
that they could not use it. They just told
them: "We can use your oil, but we are not
going to give you more than 12j cents per
pound for it." Why did they do that? It was
because they knew the Canadian oil producers had no other market, and either had
to meet this price or lose their oil. They
had no alternative but to meet the price of
12! cents. Is that the kind of spirit that was
supposed to be behind the removal of the
ban on the manufacture and sale of margarine? This is far from the course which we
were told would be followed when we discussed this matter in 1947 and 1948. Conditions became so bad that one Quebec oil
manufacturer was forced to close his doors
because he could not find a market. The
best price he was offered would not cover the
cost of manufacturing his product.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Where did he sell his
oil before margarine came on the market?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: My friend knows that
during and immediately following the war
there was a world oil pool. By 1949 that pool
had disappeared. The English market was
closed and the American market was filled.
The only place the Canadian oil manufacturer could sell his product was in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: So it was of great
advantage to them to have margarine manufactured in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: My honourable friend
may think so, but I do not see the advantage
of producing oil and then having to sell it at
below cost price.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The oil manufacturers
could not have sold their product at all if
there had been no market for margarine
purposes.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes, but the result was
that this manufacturer had to close his doors.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He would have had to
close them sooner if he had not had a market for part of it.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: He would not have
closed his doors if the producers of margarine in Canada had been obliged to buy Cana-

MAY 9, 1950
dian oil at the same price they were paying
for American oil We should not weaken our
exchange position by the unnecessary outlay
of American dollars. We should not send
these dollars to the United States to purchase
a product which can be obtained in Canada.
Those who have been manufacturing margarine have not been reasonable in their
treatment of the Canadian oil producers. Not
only are they not encouraging the manufacture of oil in Canada, but they are ruining
the oil market in this country by making
margarine with a foreign product which is
in competition with a purely Canadian one.
My honourable friend from Waterloo
argued that the removal of the sales tax on
margarine would benefit the consumers of
our country. I am going to say one more
word about this. We have been invited to
picture our men and women going into
grocery stores and buying margarine at 21
to 3 cents per pound less than they have been
paying for it. It has been said that this
would be of great help to our consumers.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It has been argued that
the competition of margarine with butter has
been good for our poorer classes; that they
have been able to buy margarine at a much
lower price than butter.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But let us be realistic,
and see whether the consumers actuaIly
benefit. The agricultural industry in this
country is going to be ruined.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Nonsense.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Our farmers have been
discouraged, and the way they are now selling
their cattle has caused some concern to the
agricultural authorities in Canada. Let us
not forget that in 1945-46 Canada produced
400 million pounds of butter, but that in 1949
production dropped to 278 million pounds.
Everyone knows that Canadian farmers find
it preferable to sell their cattle for a high
price on the Canadian and American market,
than to continue to feed their stock in order
to produce something which will have to be
sold below cost. Nobody can blame the
farmers for this, but the consequence has
been that the price of meat has risen to such
an extent that many Canadians cannot afford
to buy it. The present scarcity of meat on.
the Canadian market would appear to have
been caused by the low prices paid for dairy
products. The poor consumer who will save
2j cents a pound on margarine will have to
pay such a high price for his meat that he
will be the loser.
Honourable senators, I am in favour of
removing taxes wherever in our economic

system we can safely do so, but before
removing the sales tax on margarine I would
certainly make sure that in the end the consumer will benefit. We should make certain
that the removal of this tax will not affect the
Canadian dairy industry, which is so necessary and vital to our people. For these
reasons I shall certainly vote against the
motion. I am not a farmer, so I would
not be injured by the removal of the sales tax
on margarineAn Hon. Senator: We are not going to
remove it.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: -but I am troubled
about this proposal. I think removal of the tax
would aggravate a situation which is already
disastrous and would greatly discourage all
farmers in Canada. Rather than pass a
motion of this kind, I think we should try
to give some encouragement to farmers. During the war the farmers instead of being
allowed to sell their butter at 90 cents to $1 a
pound, had to accept a ceiling price of 30
to 40 cents, and I consider it most unfortunate that so soon after the war we
should have alowed to come on the market
a product, which is not even a truly Canadian
product, directly competing with butter. This
product sells at approximately half the price
of butter for which it is a substitute, and
this results in a competition that our dairymen cannot meet. The situation is an unhappy one, and I should like honourable
senators to try to protect our dairy industry,
which is so necessary from more than one
point of view.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
my honourable friend from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) concluded his very interesting
and, to my mind, somewhat illogical address,
by giving the reasons why he intends to
vote against this motion. I propose to give
three reasons that impel me to support it.
But before stating those reasons, may I for
a moment deal with some phases of tht argument which my honourable friend made?
He says, in the first place, that if you remove
the sales tax from margarine the difference
wil amount to something like 3 cents a
pound, the manufacturers will take advantage of it, the consumers will not benefit, and
consequently there would be no virtue in
sacrificing the revenue now obtained from
the tax. There I think my friend was wholly
illogical.
He suggested that what he thinks would
be the tendency of manufacturers could be
overcome by having some governmental
authority to control prices and see that the
public were not exploited. There again my
friend was illogical. If that theory were to be
accepted it would have to be applied to

SENATE
many more products than margarine. Are
we to go back to the system of price controls,
regulations, governmental directions, and
decisions by governmental officials as to
when a manufacturer of margarine or clothing or anything else is charging too much for
his product?
Hon. Mr. Horner: We have that now.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The cure does not lie
there. The cure lies in opening the doors
of competition as wide as possible, for in
healthy competition we shall find the surest
remedy for excessive prices.
My honourable friend also argued that
certain raw materials entering into the
production of margarine come from outside
Canada and, as I understood him, mainly
from the United States. Well, possibly that
is so, but much of the material that constitutes the ingredients of margarine is
Canadian. It may surprise my honourable
friend to know that milk is an important
ingredient in the manufacture of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Not in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Oh, yes, in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Skimmed milk, at 2 cents
a quart.
Hon. Mr. Reid: To give it a butter flavour.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Even if all the ingredients
of margarine had to be imported, would there
be anything remarkable in that?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Under this government
there would not be.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Canada sold to the United
States last year goods of one kind and another to a value of more than one and a half
billion dollars.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But how much did we
purchase from the United States?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I did not interrupt my
honourable friend even once. I do not believe
in interrupting honourable members when
they are addressing the house.
Hon. Mr. Horner: When you think they
are wrong you do.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Even if raw materiaIs for
margarine do come from the United States,
is trade with the United States an unfortunate
thing for this country? If the whole Canadian
economy has one need, it is markets, wherever
we can get them. By importing raw materials
for margarine from the United States, we
are helping to find a market for some
Canadian products.
If the manufacture of margarine in Canada
were to be stopped because some ingredients

are imported from the United States, what
should be said about all our other industries
that depend upon that country for their raw
What about the great cotton
materials?
textile industry of Canada, which I believe
has its main factories in my honourable
friend's province? There is a Canadian industry dependent upon the outside world for
every pound of its raw material. I would not
for a moment suggest that the cotton textile
industry should be discriminated against
because it imports its raw materials from the
United States, and I do not think my friend's
argument as to margarine is very logical.
I wish to allude to another point in the
address of my honourable friend. He picturned the butter situation as a terrible one,
pointing out that the government has on its
doorstep several million pounds of butter for
which it cannot find a market, and he ascribes
the surplus to the fact that we have permitted the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine, a competitor of butter. Well, I would
suggest that the government probably fixed
the support price of butter too high.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In 1949, he says, 74 million
pounds of margarine were manufactured in
Canada. Well, I do not know what the
spread between the price of butter and the
price of margarine is today; but if we say
that it has averaged 20 cents a pound, it is
clear that Canadian consumers of margarine
have saved $14 million.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is a not inconsiderable item in the housekeeping expenses of the
poorer people of this country.
My honourable friend argued also that if
the sales tax were removed from margarine
the agricultural industry of Canada would be
ruined. There again he is quite illogical. As
a matter of fact, butter is only a small part
of the total production of our dairy industry.
The biggest part of the dairy business in this
country is the sale of fluid milk in all our
cities. It is most gratifying that, through
the steady increase of this business, the
health-giving benefits of milk are being ever
more widely distributed. The production of
cheese must also be taken into account. For
the life of me I cannot follow the argument
that the agricultural industry will be ruined
if the sales tax on margarine is removed. I
am sure that, upon reflection, my honourable
friend will agree with me.
For three reasons, which I shall briefly
indicate to the house, I support the motion of
the honourable senator from Waterloo.
First, this tax is imposed on an essential
food. It may be argued that we could get

MAY 9, 1950
along without margarine; but I venture the
statement that the consequence in thousands
and thousands of homes would be a lowered
consumption of the fats which are essential
to a young and growing family. For the poor
human who inhabits this troubled world three
things are essential: food, clothing and shelter.
It is a great mistake as well as an injustice
to impose taxes on the vital necessaries of
life. My honourable friend referred to customs tariffs. I might cite duties on garments,
on woollen blankets, on boots and shoes as
amongst those exactions which bear heavily
on rich and poor alike. One of the sound
principles of taxation is that it be levied where
it will affect least the living standards of the
people and fall chiefly upon those best able
to pay. When, by means of a tariff or a sales
tax, the cost of the essentials of human life
is increased, burdens are imposed upon the
poorer people of the community. The very
fact that sales of margarine have risen to the
point they have now reached proves how
beneficial this article has been to the great
labouring classes, and, indeed, to the farmers
as well. I know agriculturists who are selling milk and buying margarine; and with
good reason, for this enables them to get a
better return on their investment.
I come now to another consideration.
Hungry people, or those who are usually
short of food, are always desperate people.
Search the records of history and you will
find that in almost any country one cares
to name no factor has been more potent in
the promotion of political unrest than a
scarcity of or unduly high prices for food.
On that ground also I argue against the
retention of a sales tax on margarine. In
my humble opinion it would be just as
reasonable and just as logical to tax milk
or bread as to tax margarine: all three foods
are not only useful, but essential.
In this connection I may recall -the position
of Newfoundland. On this matter I should
like to hear from our colleagues who represent that province. I believe that when
negotiations for confederation with Canada
were under way one of the conditions upon
which Newfoundland's negotiators insisted
was -the maintenance of the free sale of
margarine in that island. And under an
arrangement, perhaps of a doubtful character,
that condition obtains today: Newfoundlanders get their margarine free of sales tax.
My second reason for supporting this motion is one which may not command unanimous approval in this chamber. Make no
mistake about it, this tax is of the order of
protection for the dairy industry. Until
the Supreme Court held otherwise a year
or so ago, the dairy industry enjoyed complete protection against margarine. It is

a curious circumstance that the arguments
against my honourable friend's motion have
been based almost entirely upon the fact
that the existing tax gives protection to a
Canadian industry. For a good many years
I have held some pretty definite views on
the question of fiscal protection for Canadian
industry; and I shall be quite frank in saying
that I am not likely to change my opinions
on that subject because of any arguments
based on expediency. Over forty-five years
ago the farmers' movement, which originated
in Western Canada, was based largely on
opposition to the principle of tariff protection of Canadian industry. There was a solid,
logical reason for that attitude: prairie
farmers were then paying the equivalent of
25 per cent duty on agricultural implements
imported from the United States. Of course,
farmers in Eastern Canada were subject to
the same duty. But it so happened that
the producers in the prairie provinces were
a long way from the implement factories of
Eastern Canada, and much closer to sources
of supply in the United States. As the years
went on the injustice as well as the unwisdom of protection, from the point of view
of the Canadian customer, impressed itself
upon parliaments and governments, and the
duties on these agricultural implements were
entirely removed. Tariff protection, has been
retained in respect of a number of other
items, though in recent years to a much
less formidable extent. I shall mention a
few. First, the Frigidaire. A Frigidaire has
come to be looked upon as a necessity in
almost every home today. It happens that
the sources of supply for Frigidaires in
Canada and the United States are about
equidistant from Winnipeg and Minneapolis;
that is to say, the cost of moving a Frigidaire
to Minneapolis is about equal to the cost of
moving one to Winnipeg. But what is the
difference in price? A Frigidaire that costs
$409 in Winnipeg can be purchased for $274
in Minneapolis. It is true that part of this
difference in price is attributable to the
depreciation of our Canadian dollar; but
even allowing for this there is still a substantial difference. A Pontiac car, which
costs the Minneapolis purchaser $1,917, costs
the Winnipeg buyer $2,600 odd, and a Bendix
washing machine, which sells for $190 in
Minneapolis sells for $249.50 in Winnipeg.
My theory in these matters is that the way
to make it easier for dairy farmers and butter
manufacturers to produce their goods is to
remove some of the cost from the commodities they are required to buy. That was the
whole contention forty-five years ago. The
farmers of Western Canada wanted the
manufacturers, who were then pretty highly
protected, to get off their backs.

SENATE
I do not think the farmers are going to
solve their problem by asking that the dairy
or butter industry be protected. As my
honourable friend from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) pointed out, tariff duties and
sales taxes are imposed on many goods which
today are regarded as necessities. I regret
that some of my friends in this chamber,
whom I know still hold pretty strong views
on tariff protection and fiscal policies, are
straying from the light into the realm of
darkness.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Why do you wish to
kick the farmer when he is down?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I shail come to that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The farmer is not down;
he has never been more prosperous than he
is today.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: While the burden on our
primary industries today is not so heavy as
it was forty-five years ago, it is still
oppressive.
I come now to my third reason. I object
to the operation of pressure groups in legislation. In my humble judgment our agricultural organizations are failing to apply
true understanding to the problems affecting
agriculture. Thus I come to the point raised
by my honourable friend from King's (Hon.
Mr. McDonald). It is wrong and unwise for
farmers to think that by putting pressure on
the government, parliament will be induced
to grant them favours in the form of subsidies and so on.

Hon. Mr. Horner: You cannot blame the
farmers for trying to do what others have
succeeded in doing for years.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The remark of my honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) is similar to the remark he usually
makes when he gets to his feet. But where
will this all end? Pressure groups are to be
found here and there. Butter was supported
under the Agricultural Prices Support Act,
and a few years ago potatoes and apples were
also supported under it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And it was under this Act
that butter was held down during the first
years of the war.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Very good. Some difficulties may have been encountered in determining the exact time of the change-over
from a state of war to one of peace; but I
hope we are in the latter state now. If you
are going to subsidize butter-and that is
what this sales tax does-then you must go
right down the line. If you accept the principle as being sound for one agricultural commodity, how are you going to argue that it is
unsound for another? Cereal foods are being

supported in Western Canada today, and we
are really getting enmeshed in this whole
principle of subsidies and price supports. I
wholly agree with my honourable friend from
Grandville when he says that inevitably the
treasury is going to be called upon to make
good the deficit; and since the treasury can
only get its money from the taxpayers or
those who are willing to lend, the time will
come when the burden will be insupportable.
One of the strongest pressure groups ever
known in this country was that formed by
the manufacturers of fifty years ago.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They are still doing
f airly well.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We have had other
pressure groups as well, but lately a transformation has taken place. The pressure
groups now come from the large classes of
labour. I have every sympathy for labour,
but I do not hold with the pressure that is
being brought to bear on governments to
grant $100 a month pensions to workers
when they reach the age of sixty-five, and to
institute a forty-hour week and make it the
law of the land. Those pressures should not
exist. I do not care whether the pressure
comes from farm groups, labour groups, banking groups or manufacturing groups; I am
just as opposed to one as I am to the other.
Just because I am a farmer-and I am a
farmer-I am not going to say that I will
support the pressure that comes from the
agriculture groups.
Hon Mr. Bouffard: How are you going to
stop it?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That question rather
implies that my honourable friend thinks it
cannot be stopped .
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, I still have sufficient
faith in the common sense of the Canadian
people to believe that they will recognize the
impossibility of such a policy. I am sure
they will realize that if these influences continue to grow and affect government in its
administration of the business of the country,
we shail be moving straight down the road
to where more and more control is centered
in the government. If governments are going
to subsidize farmers, then they must ultimately tell thern what they are to grow and
how much they are to produce; in other
words, they cannot be left as free agents.
This is why I cannot agree with those who
advocate support prices and discrimination in
favour of butter-producers. It is my opinion
that these things are fatal in the long run;
and for this and the other reasons that I have
outlined, I am opposed to them.

MAY 9, 1950
I am well aware of the fact that the agricultural industry in Canada stands in a peculiar
position.
It has always been so.
For
instance, pressure is exerted by large labour
groups for increases in the wages paid by,
say, transportation companies, and when the
demand is met one result is an increase in
freight rates. A few years ago we had in
this country a steel strike, which was settled
by a substantial increase in wages to the
workers in the mills. No one begrudges these
workers a fair wage, but that increase
brought about the sharpest rise that we have
had for many years in the price of agricultural implements to the farmers right across
Canada. How is that to be adjusted? The
farmer cannot pass it on. The maker of steel
says: "My costs have gone up, so I must raise
the price of my iron and steel." In turn, the
agricultural implement manufacturer says:
"The cost of my raw materials, iron and
steel, have risen, so I must put up the price
of my agricultural implements." And who
can say him nay in those circumstances?
These price increases are passed on until they
finally reach the primary producer, the tiller
of the soil, and he cannot pass them on any
further. His back is to the wall.
It is the consequence of that situation that
has impelled farmers to bring pressure on
governments to support prices out of the
public treasury, if necessary. I do not think
that the solution is to be found in that procedure, because I am afraid that in the end
it is bound to break down, and that when
that time comes the farmers will be in an
even worse position than they are in today.
That is certainly the way it strikes me, but
of course my judgment may not be right.
In conclusion I wish to say that neither
parliament nor a government should ever permit itself to become an agency for pressure
groups. I recall the situation at Washingtoh.
There lobbying by pressure groups for one
thing and another reached such proportions
that lobbyists had to be certified or registered, and American pressure groups now
spend through these lobbies millions of dollars every year. I think it would be most
unfortunate if anything like that ever developed in this country, and so I am against
pressure groups. I hope our parliament will
not at any time in future succumb to their
influence and be deflected from the duty
of representing the people of Canada-not
the farmers alone, nor labour nor any other
one class, but all the people of Canada-and
that it will constantly endeavour to make
sure that the laws passed here are fair, just
and equitable to all classes of our population.
Hon. J. Wesley Sfambaugh: Honourable
senators, I first wish to welcome the new

members of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Isnor and
Hon. Mr. Hawkins). For a day or two I had
one of them as a deskmate, which was a
pleasure for me, because for some little time
I had been sitting up in this end of the
chamber alone.
Also, their appointment
means that I have moved up a bit in senority
and am no longer the second lowest on the
list.
I am opposed to this resolution and object
to some of the remarks made by previous
speakers. It seems to me to be a case of
the cities against the country. The honourable gentlemen from Waterloo and Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Euler and Hon. Mr. Crerar)
referred to our dairy farmers as a pressure
group. I do not think they are. I
think that representatives of the Canadian Council of Agriculture, the Dairy
Council and the Federation of Agriculture
should be invited to come here and give us
their views. And if they are invited they had
better come, because after listening to some
speeches I am afraid the Canadian farmer
has not too many friends in the Senate.
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) spoke of dairy farmers as a
"deeply entrenched and privileged interest,"
and the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) referred to them
as a "favoured interest." Well, I do not
think they are favoured too much. As a matter of fact, I do not think they are favoured
at all.
After listening to some honourable senators one would almost think that the dairy
farmer was a menace to the national life of
Canada, whereas the truth is that he is
engaged in this country's most essential
industry. Without him, the consumer would
perish.
I think the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity had a much better argument when he said he was opposed to all sales
taxes. I do not suppose any of us like to pay
taxes. I come from a province where taxation has been a very live issue, where a
political group known as the Social Credit
Party came into power on a platform promising that they would abolish taxation. They
have now been in power for fifteen years and
our taxes have trebled. So the tax question
is like the weather-people talk a lot about
it but do nothing.
As to the suggestion that the dairy farmers
are a privileged group, I would point out
that there is no other Canadian industry
which finds it so difficult to get hired help.
If dairy farming was a privileged and
pleasant occupation, this would not be so.
Let us consider who the dairy interests really
are. In plain words, they are just the people

SENATE
who milk cows. Until a short time ago I was
one of them, and I do not mind saying that
I like this job here mnuch better.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: My son is one of
them, and so is my grandson. I may say that
my grandson, who goes out to milk cows in
the norning before he leaves for school, will
be interested to learn that some of our honourable senators regard him as a privileged
character. Nearly al my neighbours are
dairy farmers, and I find them hard-working,
honest and kindly folk. I apprecia-te neighbours of this kind.
In Canada there are about 700,000 farmers,
and more than half of them are dairy
farmers. A very large proportion of them
derive most of their income from the sale of
dairy products.
It was suggested here, just this afternoon,
by the honourable gentleman from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar)-and it has been suggested
by others-that butter is not an important
product of the dairy industry. The fact is
that butter is the most important product of
that industry, and approximately half of
the commercial milk supply of Canada is
used in its manufacture. The actual figure is
47-3 per cent. On the other hand, fluid milk,
which the honourable gentleman said was
a more important product than the milk used
in the manufacture of butter, amounts to
only 24-2 per cent of the total commercial
milk supply. In other words, about twice as
much milk is used in the manufacture of
butter as is sold as fluid milk. And the
quantity of milk used in the manufacture of
cheese, which has been mentioned as a very
important proportion, is only 8 per cent of
the total. Those percentages apply to 1948,
the last year for which I was able to obtain
figures. In the manufacture of butter the
farmer keeps the skim milk, which is a
most important ingredient in the feeding of
calves, pigs and poultry.
The next largest use that is made of milk,
and an extremely important one from the
standpoint of our national health, is in its
sale as fluid milk. This is extremely
important to cities like Toronto and Ottawa.
The sale of fluid milk absorbs approximately
25-to be exact, 24-2-per cent of our total
production. A large part is consumed in the
cities by children, who need this important
element of food. If the sale of margarine
should seriously injure the dairy industry,
the consequences to our way of life would
be disastrous, for when you imperil the
butter industry you also imperil the fluid
milk supply.
Another important factor in the manufacture of butter is that over 80 per cent of the

price of the product is returned to the dairy
farmer. But practically al the materials
which go into margarine are imported, and
the money for them is diverted to interests
outside Canada. There are over 1,100 creameries in this country, and they employ
thousands of people. Margarine is produced
in not more than, possibly, half a dozen
plants.
I would also point out that dairying is one
of the most important factors in the conservation of soil fertility.
I have found that the conditions under
which the dairy farmers in Ontario operate
are not so different from our own. Three
years ago my wife and I were visiting in
Ontario with relatives who are dairy farmers.
It is my custom to rise early in the morning.
At times this habit has been very annoying
to my wife and other members of our family,
and I was warned that I must not get up too
soon and disturb the people whom we were
visiting. The first morning after our arrival
I heard people moving around downstairs long
before daylight, so I got up and went down.
I found the light on, the fire built and the
kettle boiling; but nobody was in sight. I
saw a light in the barn, so I went out and
found my nephew and his wife milking the
cows. Evidently there was no possibility of
my disturbing dairy farmers early in the
morning. They had to milk early because
they were delivering to a cheese factory, and
the milk had to be there before eight o'clock.
I suggested to my nephew that he was getting around rather early, and he said: "Yes,
we are up an hour earlier than we really
should be, because we are on daylight saving
time so that the fellows in the city can have
an extra hour in the evening to play golf."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: The honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who sits near meHon. Mr. Roebuck: He does not mind!
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: -said that the consumers of his city could not afford to pay
present prices for dairy products. I have not
quite as much sympathy for the people of
Toronto as he has, but I have singled out
Toronto because he mentioned it, and also
because I understand that it is the best city
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I have often heard it
spoken of as "Toronto the good"; and on one
occasion I saw in a parade a float which represented Toronto as an angel surrounded by
cherubs. I presume the angel represented

MAY 9, 1950
the adult population and the cherubs, probably, the children. But apparently not ail
the people of Toronto are angels. While
looking up some information about the- city,
I noticed that in 1948 the people of Toronto
spent $23 million for fluid milk. That amount
would provide a great boost for the dairy
industry, and I suppose most of the milk went
to the "cherubs", for I also learned that the
inhabitants spent in the same year $21 million
for cigarettes and $42 million for liquor. It
appears to me, therefore, that the people of
Toronto can buy butter if they want to.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: In that connection
I might point out that the dairy f armer is the
largest purchaser of Toronto's manufactured
products. This is a consideration that holds
good of other cities in Canada where there
are plants that manufacture agricultural
implements and various farm supplies. Without the farmers, most of the people in these
plants would be out of work.

The dairy farmer furnishes us with milk,
butter, eggs and meat. To put it bluntly,
people in cities like Toronto would starve to
death were it not for the dairy industry.
Margarine would not save them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What would the dairy
industry do for customers?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Those engaged in the
dairy industry can at least feed themselves,
and that is more than you fellows can do.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: The very foundation
of Canadian agriculture is the dairy industry,
and I propose to vote against this resolution
because I intend to do what I can to encourage
and protect this most important and essential
industry.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Farris the debate
was adjourned.

MARGARINE-REMOVAL OF TAX
MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of the
Honourable Senator Euler, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Lambert, that in the
opinion of the Senate margarine should be
added to the list of foods which are exempt
from the sales tax of 8 per cent.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, the discussion on this motion has already
been so clear and comprehensive that it is
with hesitation that I prolong the debate. The
wording of the resolution would cause one to
think that the proopsal is non-contentious. On
its face, the proposition is simply that under
the policy of the Act certain foods, particularly dairy products, are generally speaking
exempt from taxation. It proceeds with the
idea that oleomargarine is a food in pari
materia with dairy products, and that it is
therefore unfair discrimination to exclude it
from the list of exempted foodstuffs.

After listening to the arguments which have
been advanced, we begin to see that this
question is not quite so simple. The implications of the resolution and, perhaps even
more, the implications that arise from some
of the speeches which have been made in support of it, involve principles that cut deeply
into the Canadian econmic problems, and raise
issues transcending this mere question of the
saving of 3 cents per pound on margarine. I
therefore venture to ask your indulgence in
order that we may consider still further some
of the implications and issues that face us in
dealing intelligently with this motion.
In the first place, this resolution clearly
proposes that the Senate should declare itself
on a matter of policy relating to taxation. As
all honourable senators know, section 53 of
the British North America Act provides that
bills for appropriating any part of the public
revenue or for imposing any tax or impost,
shall originate in the House of Commons. The
next section of the B.N.A. Act goes on to indicate that such bills are government bills,
because they can only originate on a message
from His Majesty the King, as represented by
the Governor General, who of course acts on
the advice of the government.
I do not want to escape on any mere technicality or by saying that this resolution is out
of order. I do not say it is, but I claim it is
outside the field generally expected to be dealt
with by the Canadian Senate. Taxation is
primarily a problem of the House of Commons,
whose members represent the electors of
Canada; and I say, as a guide to honourable
senators in approaching a resolution of this
kind, that it must be a serious and urgent
proposal in deed which can justify us in dictating in advance-because that is what this
resolution asks us to do-the policy of the
government and of the House of Commons in
regard to a question of taxation. And particularly is that so when we have a government recently sustained and a House of
Commons recently elected. There is just a
danger that passage of this resolution might
be regarded as a meddlesome and mischievous
interference, and not an expression of the
sober second thought which is the primary
duty assigned to us.
Let us look at some of the facts in
relation to this question. The first thing
that I ask honourable members to consider
is the policy of the government. It is true
that the Senate does not have to accept the
government's policy, even though most senators today are probably Liberals-that is,
of the same party as the government-but
on a question of taxation I myself feel it
would be most presumptuous for us to try
to dictate in advance to a newly elected
government on a pure question of taxation,

MAY 10, 1950
when the government's policy has already
been vindicated by the people. The policy
of this country is to place a floor under the
price of butter, and in order to carry out that
policy the country is investing millions of
dollars and, rightly or wrongly, is up to the
neck in the matter. This proposal is a direct
challenge to the policy of thiis country as
to butter.
Another thing that puzzles me a good deal
about the whole trend and drift of this matter is the fact that the present resolution
follows in the wake of a proposed statute
introduced by my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) with the object of
abolishing the restrictions against margarine.
The question of parliament's right to enact
these restrictions was referred to
the
Supreme Court of Canada, which has
declared that parliament has no jurisdiction
to impose the restrictions. But, honourable
sena-tors, that decision was given by a divided
court. The Chief Justice of Canada and the
next senior member of the court gave dissenting judgments, stating that parliament
has jurisdiction. An appeal from the court's
judgment is being taken to the Privy Council and will be heard at the next sitting of
that body. In view of the divided opinion
in the Supreme Court of Canada no lawyer
would think of offering an unqualified opinion as to what the results of that appeal may
be.
Now, I am wondering why there is an
attempt to "beat the gun", as it were, before
the appeal is decided by the Privy Coundil.
And I am just a little apprehensive that
intentionally, or-I give my honourable
friends the benefit of the doubt-unintentionally, the object is to try to consolidate the
position of the margarine vendors against
the interests of the Canadian farmer before
the appeal is decided by the Privy Council,
so that, in the event of the Privy Council
deciding that parliament has jurisdiction to
impose these restrictions, a renewed and
even stronger demand on parliament may be
made at a later date. I think this is a point
that every member of the Senate should
consider in advance of a decision that honourable members of both houses may have
to make on this question a little later. Why
al the rush to try to consolidate the margarine position?
Dealing with the wider aspects of this
case, the next question that I would ask
honourable members to consider is: Against
whom is there being practised this discrimination of which we have been told in
voices that almost tremble? Is it discrimination against Lever Brothers and Canada
Packers and in favour of the Canadian
farmer?

If that is so, I should like to see these
people come forward and declare themselves.
I do not think that was the intention of the
resolution; but it may be the result.
Is there a complaint that the alleged discrimination is unfair to the margarine consumer as contrasted with the butter
consumer? Well, the honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) made some
inquiries on that point, and he stated to the
house that he .could discover no demand by
consumers generally that would justify my
-honourable friend in coming here and saying
that he stands for the consumers to the
extent that he would ask this house to challenge the policy of the elected representatives
in the House of Commons.
My honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) referred to organized labour as
one of the pressure groups. Yet one of the
functions of organized labour in Canada over
the last decade and longer has been to'protect the consumers when it has been thought
that their interests were being interfered
with. OZ course my friend would not tolerate
labour stepping in on this question, because
that would be a pressure group, and therefore
taboo. I take it that as long as the people
interested are only represented by senators,
with nobody outside this house to back them
up, there is not a pressure group, and therefore everything is quite all right.
Is it unfair to compare the treatment that
the butter consumers get with the treatment
received by margarine consumers? If I propose to ignore my interest in the farmerand I think I have some-and buy margarine,
I can get it, even with the tax, for twenty
cents or twenty-dive cents a pound less than
I pay for butter. With that differential in
price between the two products, can anyone
say that there is unfairness of treatment as
between the consumers of butter and the
consumers of margarine in this country? I
cannot see it.
Mark you, honourable senators, our friends
who support this resolution are keen to
assure us that this article, which we can buy
for twenty cents a pound less than we pay
for butter, is just as good as butter. Well,
I do not think it is; but later I shall have
something to say on that point. For the time
being I accept their own statements, because
we can meet them both going and coming.
If margarine is just as good as butter, then
there is no discrimination against margarine
consumers, because they can buy it much
cheaper than butter. On the other hand, If
margarine is not as good as butter, people
should not be allowed to buy it.
Is it true that there is any substantial
number of indigent persons in Canada who

SENATE
cannot afford to buy margarine at its present
price, but who could pay the contrasted
theoretical price of three cents per pound
less?
Let us look at that question. In the first
place, this sales tax is purely a tax to provide
revenue for public purposes. I cannot believe
that in this day of continued prosperity in
this country, with high wages and general
employment, there is any substantial group
of citizens who-without undue extravagance
in the consumption of beer and cigarettes, as
was suggested by my friend from Rosetown'
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine)-cannot afford to buy
margarine at its present price. I cannot
believe that there is any such group on whose
behalf we should claim-in tremulous voices
-protection from the necessity of paying an
additional three cents a pound for this
product.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Your voice is tremulous
too.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I have caught the disease.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is part of the
advocacy.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, honourable senators,
it is advocacy; and I hope it is intelligent
and fair advocacy.. I would say that normally
almost 100 per cent of our people can afford
to buy margarine, and that none of us need
waste any sympathy over this extra cost
of three cents a pound. I do not wish it to
be supposed that I cannot put a certain
tremulousness in my voice in speaking of
these people. I am as capable as is my
honourable friend of charging my appeals
with organ effects. But I would prefer to
point out that we in Canada have an intelligent way of dealing with this problem.
If 95 per cent of the population are able
to pay a tax, and it is a just tax, why should
it be removed in order to protect the small
class for whom assistance is necessary? I
say that is not the right approach. Taxes
are needed. The sales tax was not introduced
for the fun of it, or with an eye to political
advantage. I know that when a sales tax
was enacted in British Columbia is was
exceedingly unpopular, but the government
imposed it because it was believed to be
necessary; and that is the reason we have
one here. There is no -country in the world
which does as much as Canada by way of
providing funds for the care of the needy
and indigent. I might draw attention to the
cost of family allowances. I have not looked
up the figure, but I believe it is in the
vicinity of $300 million a year.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: $307 million.
Hon. Mr. Farris: As my honourable friend
says, the taxpayers of this country, including

those who are paying the sales tax, are
providing $307 million for this purpose. The
more needy the family the greater the benefits.
Or consider the cost of mothers' pensions.
In British Columbia, so many years ago
that I would hate to tell you when, I had
the honour of introducing a bill to provide
mothers' pensions. The money, of course,
comes from taxes paid by the Canadian
people. The same is true as regards unemployment insurance, hospital and medical
insurance, workmen's compensation, old age
pensions, and a host of other social services
to benefit those for whom the state must
have special regard. It is the height of
fallacy to argue that, in the interest of the
comparatively few who are looked after from
the proceeds of the taxes we raise, we should
abolish a tax that falls on the many who
are well able to pay.
In the next place, I repeat what was
said yesterday by my honourable friend from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), and others
who have spoken already, that there can
be no asurance that the proceeds of the
remission of these three cents will inure
in whole or in part to the benefit of the
consumer. Quite a few firms are listed as
manufacturers of margarine, but I believe
the experience in the United States would
be repeated here, and that production would
be dominated by Lever Brothers, Canada
Packers, and one or two other big concerns.
In considering this question it is worth
while to give attention to the prices of
margarine in Canada, compared with those
in the United States. According to the latest
figures, in March the retail price of margarine
in the United States was 28J cents a pound
while in Canada it was 34 cents a pound in
March and 341 cents in April. It will be noticed
further from the return, which is available
to honourable senators, that in every month
since margarine has been on the Canadian
market the price here has been decidely
higher than the price in the United States.
That differential, I am told, is not made
necessary by the comparative costs of manufacture. I wonder, when all this energy is
being devoted in the Senate to protecting
the buyer, that someone has not moved to
find oui; why more is charged for margarine
in Canada than in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What about other commodities? Automobiles for instance?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am coming to that.
Despite all the eloquence of the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) on
this matter of three cents, I fail to find a
single resolution by him with respect to the
tariff on automobiles. Moreover, as I entered
this chamber the honourable senator from

MAY 10, 1950
Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald) who recently
put a question on the order paper, told me
that he finds, through other inquiries, that
while the retailers profit on butter sold in
Canada is from two to three cents a pound,
the profit on the sale of margarine right
here in Ottawa ranges from five to eight
cents. So the producers and retailers of
margarine, even if they were to absorb the
three cents tax, would still have a margin
of profit as large as is obtained from butter.
I should like to know why so much interest
is concentrated on this very limited phase
of commodity taxation and no effort is made
to protect the consumer against the producers
and vendors of margarine.
Now, observing this margin between prices
in this country and in the United States,
and with the knowledge we have that in
the United States the production of margarine is largely dominated by Lever Brothers
and one or two other big concerns, and that
similar conditions in this country are practically inevitable, what assurance can there
be that, were this tax removed, the consumer would get the benefit? Other honourable senators have discussed that question.
All I want to say in addition is that I am
glad my honourable friend from Waterloo
has mentioned automobiles.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I could mention many
other instances of differences in prices as
between Canada and the United States.
Hon. Mr. Farris: You will not hear my
honourable friend advocating the abolition
of customs duties on automobiles to enable
farmers and other people in Canada to buy
their cars as cheaply here as they can be
bought in the United States. But in relation
to what producers in general would do, if
they get protection, let us consider what
happens in the automobile business. We
know that the automobile manufacturers fix
a price as near to the cost on the other side,
plus duty, as will permit them to sell in
their protected market. Would not the practice in respect of margarine be the same
as it is in the case of other protected commodities? I have no doubt that it would.
If my honourable friends are as interested
in the consumers as they profess to be, there
are many more advantageous ways in which
they might achieve better results.
The major issue involved in this question
is not whether Lever Brothers are being
discriminated against in favour of the
Canadian farmer, but whether it is in the
interests of Canadians to confer tax exemptions on a commodity, which threatens to
destroy the Canadian dairy industry, in
order to further stimulate the sale of that

commodity. This question and the arguments advanced by those in favour of this
resolution strike at the very root of the
economic policy of the nation.
My honourable friends from such industrial centres as Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), and TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), are demanding
relief for the consumers at the expense of
Canada's most vital industry, agriculture.
The speech of the honourable gentleman
from Waterloo was rather mildly delivered,
but in reading it over one discovers that
there is quite a sting to it. The honourable
senators from Waterloo and Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) both had the temerity to say
that the Canadian farmers formed pressure
groups and my friend from Waterloo even
went so far as to poke some friendly fun at
a recent convention of dairymen at the
Seigniory Club in Quebec. He referred tothe high prices these "poor, impoverished"
men had to pay for their board and lodging.
Well, his story was not even original, about
two weeks ago I read the same story in the
margarine people's literature.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: You do not pretend
these dairymen were farmers? They were
members of the dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, they were not farmers,
nor were they men for whom protection
should be given. I have some knowledge
about the dairymen. Many of them are
farmers, and their president is a farmer.
And I have some knowledge about the
interests dairymen have-and I mean dairymen who process milk and sell and deliver
their commodity, as distinguished from farm
dairy producers. On a former occasion I told
this house that my son was in this business,
and my knowledge of and interest in the
dairy business arises only from this fact. I
have consulted with these people and I
know they are concerned with only one
aspect of the margarine question. They
claim, and I believe them, that they can
make just as much money by selling margarine as by selling butter. They are not
much afraid of any additional competition
that butter might have to meet if the price
of margarine were reduced by three cents
a pound by reason of the removal of the
sales tax. The one thing they fear is that
the position of margarine might become so
established as to destroy the dairy farmer
and thereby put the dairies out of business.
Why do they fear this? It is because there
might not be any milk produced for dairy
purposes. My friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) shakes his head, but I shall
give him some figures.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Would my honourable
friend permit a question? I dislike to interrupt.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I like to be interrupted.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Very well. In the light
of what he has said how does he explain the
fact that countries like Denmark and Holland,
the most specialized dairy countries in
Europe, have always sold margarine to their
own people?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am not interested or
concerned about that. All I say is that this
is neither Denmark nor Holland. Conditions
in those countries are very different from
what they are here, and my honourable friend
knows that as well as I do.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Well, take any other country in the world.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Now then, who are the
consumers for whom my honourable friends
speak? Amongst others, they are the wage
earners in the Canadian protected industries.
If you drive out the dairy farmers who will
you have in their place to furnish a home
market? To a large extent the industries of
Canada are dependent on the home market.
This is not so much the case in British
Columbia because we sell our lumber, fish
and other products on world markets, but
we buy the implements to produce them in
the protected markets of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I see that my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
agrees with me. The home market depends
on the wage earners of Canada.
My honourable friend from Churchill in
supporting the resolution may take an opposite position to that of the honourable gentleman from Waterloo; he may not be a protectionist, but certainly the people who gain
their livelihood in the industrial centres are
protectionists by necessity. If it were not for
the customs duties which the consuming public of Canada pay to support the industries
in those centres, there would be no wage
earners to buy margarine or anything else.
My honourable colleague from Churchill
says that hungry people are desperate people.
I do not think there is anything in present
conditions to justify the warning he conveys
in this statement. But if the policy of my
friends were adopted, it could then be said
that hungry and unemployed people are a
desperate people. Such conjured-up conditions are out of place in Canadian economy
at this time. I do not believe that there is
any occasion to sabotage the principles which
justify our forms of taxation for the protection for our industries, and which contribute

to the material prosperity of this country. If
there are some Liberals who still proclaim
the doctrine of free trade-and I think they
have departed a long way from it-they must
adhere to it only on the basis that it applies
all down the line, and is not for the benefit
of one industry at the expense of others.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who says that?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I say it. The facts are
that the consumers in the industrial centres
owe their prosperity and very existence to
the policy of protection which has built up
those centres at the expense of both the producers and consumers, and particularly of
the consumers in Western Canada and the
Maritime Provinces.
I have some 1947 figures, the latest which
I could get, on the Ontario automobile industry. In that year the industry produced $335
million worth of automobiles and $126,560,000
worth of automobile accessories, a total of
$461,560,000.
The 40,700 employees in the
Ontario automobile industry received wages
amounting to $92 million. I wonder what
would be the result if my honourable friend
from Churchill carried his suggestions right
through?
Hon. Mr. Euler: What about automobiles?
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend from
Waterloo says, "What about automobiles?"
Hon. Mr. Euler: Or any other commodity.
Hon. Mr. Farris: We will stick to automobiles.
The honourable member from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) gave us some
touching examples of the higher prices that
Canadians have to pay for goods produced in
this country than Americans are charged for
similar goods made in the United States. He
cited as illustrations a certain low-priced
motor car, a washing machine and a refrigerator. All these things are necessities of
modern life, necessities for not only the rich
but for the ordinary wage earner as well.
The prices that our people have to pay for
these goods include high taxes, which help
to preserve the industrial life of the communities where the goods are manufactured.
Seeing that my honourable friend went so far
as to enunciate the principle that he did, I
wonder why he confined himself to this poor
little tax of 3 cents a pound and left
untouched the millions of dollars of taxes that
really go to the root of what he is advocating.
He tells us that the tariff policy has always
been against the farmers, but I have seen no
indication that he has really come to grips
with this problem or that other honourable
members have come to grips with the question of how the price of margarine could be
cut down, if that is what they are really
interested in.

MAY 10, 1950
Now I want ta direct the attention of hancurable senators to this question: What have
the margarine praducers ta offer as a substitute for the Canadian dairy industry? I arn
not now talking merely about the substitution
-of margarine for butter, but 1 arn looking at
the broader aspect. What has the margarine
industry ta offer the people of Canada in
place of the but-ter industry? Well, the margarine industry imports foreign materials.
That brings me ta the littie controversy that
,occurred in this hause yesterday when my
honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) was quating from memory-and a
mighty good memory, I now think-of what
,the hanourable gentleman from Waterloo
<Hon. Mr. Euler) said here two years ago. I
always like ta get 'the records, and I have
here the revised Debates of the Senate. This,
unlike a book which has been published by a
former member of this hause, is not
"Unrevised andi unrepented", but is revised
and, I almast suspect, repented.
I refer ta the Debates of the Senate for
1948, at page 174, and I should like hanourable senaýtors -ta note the context. We were
not discussing at that time-February 18,
1948-any abstract question of wha't quantity
of vegetable ails could theareticaily be produced in Canada. That was not; the question.
My honourable friend was seeking aýt that
tîme ta induce this bouse ta support repeal of
the restrictions on margarine, in order that
marTgarine might be manufactured in Canada.
And in this context the only abject in quoting
figures as ta the production af vegetable ails
in Canada was ta assure the house that margarine would be rnanufactured out of local
ingredients. There cauld have been no other
abject. Now, in the llght of that cantext, let
us see what my honourable friend said. Here
it is:
As a matter of fact, we do not need to Import any
cil whatsoever. The United States does flot import
any 01l for the manufacture of margarine, and we
would not do so either, even from the United
States.

If that is not; a direct statement of fact,
then I am afraid I cannot understand what it
's.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Will my hanourable friend
permit me? Would he read also, from page
175, where I amplified that statement?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes. I have got ail that
marked too, and if does flot change the statement a bit. For, mark you, honourable senators, when my honourable friend made these
further remarks he was stili appealing for the
vote of this house on anly one issue-a change
in the law ta make passible the manufacture
af margarine because the materials for ifs
manufacture are available here in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They could be.

Hon. Mr. Farris: Surely, honourable senators, we are flot interested in any abstract
question. We might fly ta the moon, but we
do nat expect ta. Unless it was practicaily
certain that the necessary ails wauld be produced in Canada, why in the world was the
production of ail in Canada brought into the
discussion at ail? If my honourable friend
was not trying ta show us that the production of these ails in Canada was a reasonable
likelihood, reference ta, the matter could only
becloud the issue.
Having said that, 1 wiil naw, at my honourable friend's request, read further from. his
remarks of February 18, 1948, as reported at
page 175:
Every ingredient of margarine can be produced
on the Canadian f arm.
Why did my honourable friend say that,
unless he meant that the ails would be produced here if the manufacture of margarine
were legaized?
Hon. Mr. Euler: 1 was trying ta help the
farmer by suggesting what could be done.
Hon. Mr. Faîris: My honourable friend was
discussing the practical question of the production of these ingredients, not an abstract
question a! whether they could be produced
in vacuo. He went on ta, say:
I make this statement on'! the highest scientlfic
authority in this country.
I am sure that reassured, every one a! us
that just as soan as the restrictions on margarine were lifted, mustard seed and other
seeds and weeds would be grown, and we
would have ail in abundance.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Did you think that?
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, I did not, for I did
nat; take any stack in this at all.
I continue ta, quate my honourable friend:
In Britain they use the ail of the peanut, or, as
they cail it, the ground nut. I am told the same 19
truc on the continent. In Newfoundland they use
whale oUl and seal ail, refined-strangely enoughin the city of Toronto and exported to Newtoundland, where they make it inta margarine, aithough
we in thia country cannot do so. In the United
States the ingredient most largely used is, I believe,
cottonseed oil. Soybean ci1 and sunflower seed ail
are aiso used. In Canada, of course, we have no
cottonseed c11, but there need be no shortage o!
vegetable 01l.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Faîiis: Surely, honourable senators, in this context that means that ail would
be available in Canada for the manufacture
of margarine.
My honourable friend continued:
In Manitoba last year the production of sunflower
seed was doubled. anid $48 worth was taken from
each acre under cultivation. We can produce an
abundance o! sunflower seed.-

Hon. Mr. Euler: Just emphasize that.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Farris: Does my honourable friend
say that that was a mere abstraction, that he
was not dealing with a practical matter?
When my honourable friend said that we
could produce the oil, surely he meant that
we were going to produce it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Anyway, here is what my
honourable friend said:
We can produce an abundance ni sunflower seed,
soybeans, rapeseed and-if you like to put it in our
margarine-milk. I repeat that I have scientiflc
authority for the assertion that excellent margarine
can be manufactured right here in Canada from the
products of the Canadian farm.

Now, in the light of that statement, let me
again read my honourable friend's other
statement:
As a matter of fact, we do not need to import any
oil whatsoever. The United States does not import
any oil for the manufacture of margarine, and we
would not do so either, even from the United
States.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Will my honourable friend
permit me again? He has placed the cart
before the horse. The statement that he has
just read was entirely modified by my later
statements, which he previously quoted.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, why did my honourable friend not tell us in 1948 that he was
modifying that statement? I will not say
anything about myself, but my honourable
friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
is a pretty astute lawyer, and it has taken
more than two years and all this discussion
for us ta find out that this statement was
supposed ta be modified.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I cannot compel farmers ta
grow rapeseed and sunflower seed.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In support of my honourable friend's 1948 bill we also had a speech
by the honourable gentleman from Thunder
Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson), which will be found
at page 416 of the Senate Debates for that
year. The bill was supported also in a speech
by the honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), who was counsel-a very
skilful and successful counsel-in the reference ta the Supreme Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Here is what he said on
May 4, 1948, as reported at page 433 of the
Senate Debates:
The answer is that out of supplies available in
Canada we have within our own power the means
to manufacture oleomargarine; and the only thing
that stands between us and the doing of it is the
prohibition which exists at the present moment.

My honourable friend has removed that
prohibition Hon. Mr. Hayden: The Supreme Court of
Canada did that.

Hon. Mr. Farris: The Supreme Court did if
with the aid of my honourable friend's persuasive argument, for which I should like ta
give him the fullest credit. Anyway, the
prohibition has been removed, but the ails
for the manufacture of margarine are not yet
produced in Canada.
Now, under the question of what substitute
the margarine industry offers ta the farmer
for the butter industry, I should like honourable senators ta consider next the matter of
health.
In this connection I was today

handed a most interesting editorial, taken
from a well-known Ottawa newspaper, The

Citizen, of May 10, 1949. Under the heading,
"Butter better than Oleo, says Scientist", a
man of high standing gives his views on the
subject, and I am sure that the editorial was
published only after a careful investigation of
the facts. It reads:
Margarine has less food value than butter according to Dr. Christian Segard, director of medical
research, Wisconsin Research Foundation, who was
guest speaker at Technical High School's morning
assembly today.
In a question period following his lecture on
vitamins, Dr. Segard, one of the world's best-known
food scientists, was asked by a student if "margarine
was as good as butter."
Dr. Segard's answer was a definite "no" and gave
three reasons:
1. Butter has more vitamins.
2. Butter is more digestible.
3. Defects, such as eye defects, begin to show in
persons of the second and third generations where
margarine is used exclusively for several decades.
"The first generation can handle margarine all
right," Dr. Segard said, "but after second and third
generations, defects begin to show up."

Hon. Mr. Euler: It is like the atomic bomb.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friends
do not seem to be so much concerned about
the welfare of the poor consumer.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What about the third
generation?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I refer you ta the Scriptures.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: What about the Newfoundlanders?
Hon. Mr. Farris: They are a hardy people.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They can stand a lot
of punishment.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There are people who
shrug their shoulders and say that the dairy
farmers need not worry about conditions
today. But authentic figures show that in
the period of April, 1948 ta April, 1949, there
was a decline of $42 million in the cash
income from the sale of dairy products, and
indication are that that amount will increase
as the operations of the margarine industry
get into full swing. It must be remembered,
honourable senators, that the great province

MAY 10, 1950
of Quebec-and I think the province of
Prince Edward Island also-prohibits the
manufacture and sale of margarine.
The suggestion has been made to the dairy
producers that they should put their full
supply of milk on the fluid milk market. My
figures on this parti-cular point are for illustrative purposes only, and may not be completely accurate; but the fact is that the
quantity of fluid milk consumed is less than
fifty per cent of the total consumption of all
dairy products; but the producer gets so
much more for the fluid milk than for
manufactured products that the returns are
about equal.
Every farmer knows, and many people
like myself are familiar with the fact, that
the dairy producers today are having great
difficulty operating their farms. If we take
away the butter market, and throw the entire
production of milk into the fluid milk
market, the consumers will have a wonderful time for one year, or possibly two, as
fluid milk would of course go down in price
because of over-production. But I think that
within two years the farmers would stop
trying to produce milk, and would sell their
cattle and go out of business. Certainly they
would not produce enough to supply the
needs in the off season. With the butter
market taken away and the production of
milk discontinued, where would the consumer be then? That threat is no mere
advocacy, honourable senators, but is based
upon tacts which cannot be controverted.
Hon. Mr. Grant: And then there would be
no buttermilk?
Hon. Mr. Farris: There would be no buttermilk either. I say, therefore, that this
synthetic cow gives no promise of welfare
for the Canadian people.
There is today, honourable senators, a
threat to the whole dairy industry. In this
connection I wish to refer to a speech of Mr.
Duplan, president of the National Dairy
Council of Canada delivered before the
recent meeting of that association. He said
this:
Highly refined vegetable oils, are today being used
in the United States not only in margarine but in
ice cream as well as fluid mllk and whipping cream.
Reliable reports would imply that this practice bas
been perfected to the point where it almost, if not
completely defies detection even by scientiflc
analysis.
I have before me some advertisements,
which I will not take time to read, about
whipping cream substitutes. I would point
out however, that the invasion by margarine,
if allowed to progress step by step, will result
in the complete extinction of the dairy
industry.

I turn now to one or two observations
made by my honourable friends and the
implications that I read into them. First, I
refer the right which is claimed to colour
margarine yellow. I ask my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Euler) what right there is
to do that? Does it have any relation to the
question involved in the resolution? At first
I thought not; but now I think that it relates
to the implications behind the resolution. It
is part of the onward movement to entrench
margarine and destroy the dairy farmers.
Let us look at this question further.
My honourable friend said that he was
thinking of the poor housewife who has to
bring home a package containing some yellow concoction, and has all the labour of
stirring it into the margarine. That argument sounded pretty far-fetched.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The housewifes do not
think so.

Hon. Mr. Farris: I have not heard any of
them complain.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You are not using the
product.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is my honourable friend
using it?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, sometimes.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Do I understand that my
honourable friend has first-hand knowledge
that the efforts of the housewives in this connection are so great that they have reason
to complain?
Hon. Mr. Euler: So they tell me.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not believe that is
the case. I say so rhetorically, and not
offensively. I ask why the margarine producers would want to colour their product at
all? I understand that its natural colour is
white. Why, ice cream also is generally white,
and it is most palatable. Come to British
Columbia and get some good potatoes, say
Ashcrofts; bake them and break them open:
you will find they are snow-white. There
are plenty of other colours just as attractive
as yellow. Lettuce is green. Apples are red,
but the flesh is white, and as luscious as any
food can be. I venture the statement that
if butter had always been white, margarine
too would remain white. Colouring adds
nothing to food value. My honourable friend
has stressed the nutritional virtue of margarine, but it is not improved one iota by staining it yellow. There is just one reason why
margarine producers wish to adopt that
colour, and it is that they want to encroach
on the goodwill asset which has been built up
over generations by butter-makers. Everybody associates yellow with butter.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Howden: Is that the reason they
colour butter?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Butter is coloured merely
for the sake of uniformity of appearance, and
to some extent yellow is its natural tint. The
fact is that over the years this colour has
been identified with butter. I say therefore
that the only reason in the world why margarine makers want to colour margarine yellow
is to convey the impression that their product
is as good as butter.
From any standpoint, this claim should not
be allowed. From the standpoint of the
farmer it is grossly unfair that others, by an
imitation of the product which he makes and
by which he has created goodwill, should
attempt to invade and appropriate that goodwill. Assume, for the sake of illustration,
that I want to buy butter because, among
other reasons, I believe the findings of the
scientist who was quoted in the Ottawa
Citizen. That being so, I feel that I have a
right to object to a manufacturer of soap or
any other commodity passing off as the
equivalent of butter something which has
been coloured to resemble butter. Then, too,
I may be willing to pay more for butter
because I am thereby supporting one of the
basic industries of this country, and because
I believe butter is better than margarine; and
I would certainly object to being fooled into
purchasing something which I did not want.
For all these reasons I view with concern
the references in this debate to the "poor
consumer" and the claims as to food values;
because I regard them as signs of a forward
movement in the interests of margarine. If
ever the time comes when the dairy industry
is driven out of business, and in its place
there is nothing left but a few manufacturing
plants in Toronto and other cities, importing
vegetable oils and operating with a small
number of employees, it will be a sorry day
for Canada.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to speak at any length, because,
from my point of view, the question has
been very ably dealt with by the honourable
senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
and the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). But there is one
angle of the question which has not been
touched on, and that is the point of view of
training for the farming industry. The honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) seems to think that a child
should be trained not to do anything; but it
is my opinion that an industry in which
400,000 farmers are engaged is an important
one, and that it should not be ruined in the
interests of some 1,200 factory employees.

Honourable senators of my age from Quebec, and the honourable senator from Prince
Albert (Hon. Mr. Stevenson), will recall the
milk-houses set in the ground, the heavy logs
with the longish opening for the shaft from
the churn, and the dog-churn itself. I remember as a boy, almost sixty years ago, thinking
what a wonderful sight it was to see the dog
churning. Every good farmer had a good
dog, and the dog churned. On one farm
where the farmer had a number of cows at
the north side of the milk-house he kept two
dogs. I recall as a child visiting a dairy farm
where the dog had "got wise" to when churning day came around; and as the work made
his feet sore, he would disappear into the
woods and hunt rabbits, if he was not tied
up.

Hon. Mr. Euler: That was a "dog-gone"
disappearance!
Hon. Mr. Horner: What I wanted to
emphasize was the value of home industry
and family training, and the threat to this
way of life which comes from the production
of margarine. This threat, in my opinion, is
very serious. I prophesy that, whatever the
result of this motion, although we may not
have a champion equal to the late Dr. Motherwell, before the next four years have gone by
someone will stand up in this chamber and
demand the prohibition of the sale of margarine in Canada. I predict, also, that margarine will be prohibited.
Let me ask the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) whether they were not both members
of the Cabinet which in 1923 banned the
manufacture and sale of margarine?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I was not.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Were they not members
of the government which maintained the ban
in effect until 1930, and from 1935 to the
present time? During those years Canada
had a Liberal government, and I am sure the
honourable member from Churchill was a
member of the Cabinet, but I have found no
record of his having shouted loud or long
against the prohibition. He knew it was
absolutely necessary.
These honourable
gentlemen, respectively the mover and the
seconder of the motion now before the Senate,
have said that they would not proceed with
it if they thought that the result would be
injurious to the Canadian dairy farmer. But
there is every evidence, as the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) has pointed out, that such would be
the direct result.

MAY 10, 1950
The larger the consumption of margarine,
the more difficult it will be to sell to advantage surplus fluid milk. At certain periods
of the year surpluses are unavoidable. At
the present time suppliers of fluid milk are
operating under contract and receive a certain
amount for their surplus. But dairymen will
not continue to equip their farms for the production of enough fluid milk to supply the
market at any time unless they can be
assured of worth-while returns for the surplus. If we continue to encourage the sale
of margarine, we shall be faced with a
shortage of fluid milk. I think it would be a
good idea for the honourable senator from
Waterloo to go to northern Saskatchewan and
travel along some of the branch lines. He
would see at almost every little station a
number of cream cans, mostly five-gallon
cans, each containing a week's or half-week's
produce of some farm, and representing the
entire current cash return to the farm home.
When the farmers get their tickets they bring
them to the stores and do their shopping. I
believe he would then realize far more clearly
than he does now how serious a .threat margarine can be to the 400,000 people operating
farms in Canada.
For these and other reasons I am not only
opposed to any relief for Lever Brothers or
Canada Packers-for that is what the purport
of the motion amounts to-but at the first
opportunity I am going to work for the abolition of the manufacture or sale of margarine
in Canada.
Hon. Jacob Nicol: Honourable senators, I
have read most of the speeches that have
been made in this house concerning this
resolution, and I do not intend to occupy
much time in this debate, because I believe
the subject has been well covered. I wish,
however, to congratulate the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) upon his very clear exposition of
this important subject.
As one who represents an agricultural district whose farmers keep from 25 to 50 cows,
it is my opinion that if this resolution were
adopted it would create a serious hardship
in my community and in the province of
Quebec. I agree with the honourable member from Vancouver South when he says

that if the price of margarine is reduced by
three cents a pound, thereby strengthening
the position of this butter substitute, the
effect will be harmful to our farming
industry.
Farmers know that their milk-producing
cows eventually have to be disposed of, and
they sell them on the market. In our rural
villages and towns we sell our cows to the
local butchers, and the market reports show
that hundreds of cows are shipped to Montreal where they are sold on the market every
week. Now, if the farmers discontinue raising cows, not only will the price of butter
go up but there will be a shortage of meat.
The only meat available will be produced by
those who raise steers, and the people in
our part of the country do not raise these
animals.
Honourable senators, it is my firm belief
that this resolution goes too far. If it were
adopted it would hurt the dairy industry
and cause a meat shortage.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hayden the debate
was adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before moving the adjournment of the Senate
may I point out that both the Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills and the Special
Committee on the constitution and functions
of Standing Committees, are scheduled to
meet immediately the Senate rises.
As
several senators are members of both committees, I would suggest that all members
of these committees report at once to room
262. The Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills, which is to hear one or two witnesses,
will meet first. This meeting should be
brief. Upon its conclusion the special committee will go right to work. I am offering
this suggestion so that the witnesses to be
heard will not be delayed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is agreeable to me.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

1. What amounts of money have been expended by
the International Boundary Commission on Columbia River Projects since 1940 and up to the end of
1949?
2. Of the amounts of money expended in connection with the Columbia River, what amount has
been expended on
(a) Investigations, and

but will be ready sometime next week. I
understand that the inquiry concerns the
International Joint Commission, and not the
International Boundary Commission.
RED RIVER FLOODS
CONDITIONS

IN WINNIPEG

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I ask
the indulgence of the house for a few
moments. The members of this chamber have
been very kind in inquiring from time to time
about the flood conditions in the city of
Winnipeg. I have received a letter from a
young married woman with three small children who lives in that city. Her husband is
the chief engineer for the Manitoba Department of Highways. This letter tells how the
people are carrying on under terrible circumstances, and as I am very proud of what they
are doing, I should like to read it:
Flood-Flood-Flood-that's all we think or talk
about these days. I haven't seen any of the flooded
areas myself-but the radio keeps stressing that

in the flooded areas. An announcement just came
over the radio that Campbell Haig, Chairman of the
school board, has announced that all Winnipeg
schools will remain closed tomorrow due to flooding
in several of the basements.
Cam. and Gerry have been busy all week-end.
Friday night Cam. helped move furniture from Joe
Racine's and Dr. Alec Sinclair's houses on Kingston

went to Wildwood to help move furniture from the
basements and first floors to the second; but the
water came up so quickly that they had a pretty
tough job. When I was giving Bruce his 11 o'clock
bottle I had the radio turned on, and when I heard
the R.C.M.P. were chasing people in speed boats
who were attempting to loot the evacuated houses
in Wildwood, I felt I had heard enough for one day.
A crisis like this brings out the best in peoplealso, I'm afraid, the worst in a few. Gerry said
when he was ai Washington's several men came
along who said they weren't needed in Wildwood
so came along the road looking for a place to be
useful. He said they pitched in and worked as
if their life depended on it. Last night he met a
lad working on the Norwood dike who lived in
Fort Garry, so Gerry asked him why he had come
over to Norwood to help, and he said, "Welil, we've
given up trying to save our house so I felt I had
better come and try to help someone else out."
They have just announced that the dike on Lyndale
Drive might give away any time and as many of
the homes are now ten feet below the water level
the people are to evacuate tonight. Mr. Collins-

The chief engineer.
-has just called Gerry to go to Norwood to take
the place of the man who has been directing the
dike reinforcements, so there is no telling when
he'll get home. It is now 9.30 p.m. How would you
like to be told to get out of your house as fast as
you can, especially with small children.

I thank you.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
this morning I was in telephone conversation
with my daughter in Winnipeg. Two of my
daughters and my son had been evacuated
from the country into the city of Winnipeg,
and this morning they got notice to leave the
place they had been moved to; so you can
see how serious the situation is. But they
said, "Well, Dad, we are all cheerful,
anyway."
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
A. K. Hugessen: Before the Orders of
Hon.
the Day are called, I should like to discuss
with honourable senators our program of
business for the next few days. In the first
place, I understand that Order No. 2, the
resolution relating to the sales tax on margarine, will probably go to a vote this afternoon: it will thus disappear from our Order
Paper. That will leave as the only remaining
item of business Order No. 3, the motion on
Federal Union. The honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) is to speak on
this, and, I understand that a number of
other honourable senators wish to take part
in the debate, but not until next week. Therefore, were the house to sit tomorrow afternoon it might have no business to transact;

SENATE

so I intend to suggest, if it be agreeable to
honourable senators, that when the house
adjourns this afternoon it shall stand
adjourned until next Tuesday afternoon.
I should like to say one thing, however, in
that connection. There is to be a meeting of
the Finance Committee tomorrow at 11 o'clock
to consider the housing situation. Mr. David
Mansur, head of the Housing Corporation, will
attend as a witness. At considerable inconvenience he has readjusted his schedule in
order to be available to honourable members
tomorrow. I therefore venture ta ask honourable senators who intend to remain in the
city to make a point of attending the meeting
of the committee.

on the excellence of his speech. This practice
however, is becoming slightly worn out
because my colleague always does such a
good job. .I certainly enjoy listening to him
more than to any other speaker-even
myself.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As I listened to him
aggressively, and at times vehemently,
expounding his cause against margarine, I
could not help thinking that he was bringing
into play a little more than ususal of those
well known arts of advocacy that he possesses to such a high degree, and that this
was caused in no small measure by the
difficulty of his task and the scarcity of the
material with which he had ta work.

OF TAX

MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Euler, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Lambert, that in the
opinion of the Senate margarine should be
added to the list of foods which are exempt
from the sales tax of 8 per cent.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, on occasion when I have followed the
honourable member from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) in debate, my first pleasurable task has been to congratulate him

Hon. Mr. Hayden:

It

seems

to me that

whenever you want a real debate, with
sentiments and emotions running high, all
you have to do is introduce a subject like
margarine in a place like the Senate of
Canada and members will wax eloquent and
speak with great feeling. We have had several of these debates, and the one now in
progress is no exception.
While listening ta my honourable friend
yesterday after reading over the other
speeches made in this debate, I began to
wonder whether I had misread the resolution introduced by the honourable member
from Waterloo (lon. Mr. Euler). But upon
re-reading the resolution I saw that what it
proposes, in simple terms, is that the government should consider adding margarine to
the list of items in Schedule 3 of the Excise
Tax Act which are exempt from sales tax.
The debate however, seems to have covered
all the pros and cons of the merits and
demerits of margarine, rather than the simple
issue of whether or not under existing circumstances the government should give consideration to removing the sales tax from
this wholesome and nutritious food.
Let me for a moment discuss realities, and
perhaps later, like some other honourable
members have done, I shall offend the house
by making a detour into side issues.
I first call attention to the purpose of the
Excise Tax Act as it relates to the sales tax.
Under the Act the sales tax is imposed on
everything that is manufactured, produced or
imported into Canada. That is where you
start. Then, by a system of exceptions provided under schedules to the Act, various
exemptions are made from time ta time and
depending upon the state of our economy,
these exemptions either increase or shrink.
There were fewer exemptions during the war

MAY 11, 1950

than in other years, but over the entire
period that sales taxes have been in force
they have never applied to butter.
The following are some of the foodstuffs
which are exempt from any sales tax:
Barley; bread; butter; cheese; cream; eggs, egg
albumen and egg yolks; glucose; honey; ice; lactose;
lard; rice; salt; soups; split peas; sugarHon.

-sugar;

sugar.

stress sugar particularly

because one

opponent of the resolution claimed that sugar

was among the taxable items, but Sugar has
enjoyed an exemption from the imposition
of any sales tax ever since the Excise Tax
Act first came into effect.
Other items exempt from the sales tax are:
Bakers' cakes and pies including biscuits, cookies
or other similar articles;
Cereal breakfast foods not including beverages;
Fish and edible products thereof;
Flour including pastry, cake, biscuit, and similar
mixes;
Foods prepared and sold exclusively for feeding
infants;
Fruit, fresh, canned, frozen, dried or evaporated;
Grain grits and meals;
Jams, jellies, marmalades, and preserves;
Malt syrup, except when sold for beverage purposes;
Maple syrup; corn syrup; table syrups, molasses,
and materials to be used exclusively in the manufacture thereof;
Meats and poultry, fresh, cooked, canned, frozen,
smoked or dried;
Mijk, including buttermilk, condensed
milk,
evaporated milk, and powdered milk;
Peanut butter and shortening and materials for
use exclusively in the manufacture thereof;
Spaghetti, macaroni, and vermicelli;
Vegetables, fresh, canned, frozen or dehydrated,
not including pickles, relishes, catsup, sauces, olives,
horseradish, mustard, and similar goods;
Vegetable juices; fruit juices which consist of at
least ninety-five per cent of pure juice of the
fruit.

reason for this is that whenever the financial
position of the country will permit it, the
policy of the government is, if possible, to
impose on such a product no tax whatever, so
as to keep down the end price of the product.
For this reason, I think, even during the last
war a direct sales tax was not applied to
such items in the schedule as butter, cheese,
cream and eggs.
In establishing the proper setting in which
to consider the question of whether margarine
should or should not be exempt from the
application of the sales tax, I find that such
items as these are free from any sales tax in.
Canada:
Potato chips;
Popping corn-

Not popcorn, but popping corn, under the
grain section.
Canned shrimps.

Now, canned shrimps are gathered down iff
the coast of Louisiana, and they are treated
and brought into Canada. They are canned
here or before they come in.
Bamboo shoots.

Then there is

a wide variety of butter

spreads, such as pineapple butter, coconut
butter.
Anchovies.

Even these are exempt.
Dried dates.
Ice cream.

This, as honourable senators know, is the
most recent exemption,
There we have the setting for the discussion of this question of whether or not it is
in the interest of the people of Canada as a
whole that margarine should be added to the
list of articles exempted from sales tax.
Now, I say to this honourable body that
it will be interesting to see if we can find a
principle running through this list. Before L

the law and all the taxes that can be conjured
up, so as to make it impossible for him to
seli his product in this country.
That is exactly opposite to the principle
underlying the Combines Investigation Act.
That Act provides that if individual corporations get together and agree to sell their
products at a pricq higher than would be
obtained in free competition, the government
shall step in and say to them: "Your agreement is not in the public interest, and we are
going to prosecute you." But the suggestion
by the opponents of margarine is that the
government should becone party to an
arrangement whereby stiíT taxes shall be
imposed upon this article of food, so that the
people of Canada, if they are allowed to buy
it at all, shall have to pay for it a price
that is exorbitant in conparison with the
cost of production, and so that the producers
of margarine shal no' bu able t sell their
product in free competition with butter.
Now let me come back to consideration of
the point as to whether there applies to the
list of articles now exempt from sales taxpotato chips dried dates, and so on-any
principle that could not equally apply to
margarine. Last year almost 74 million
pounds of margarine were sold in Canada.
My understanding is that the average whole:sale price of margarine was roughly 26 cents
.a pound, so the sales tax of 8 per cent brought
into the revenue of the country approximately
one and a half million dollars.
That brings me to a point made by my
friend from Vancouver South. Referring to a
speech delivered here in February 1948 by
the honourable gentleman from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), he deduced from the context
a certain implication as to the availability of
vegetable cils and fats in Canada. Well, if
I rightly understand the context of what was
said yesterday by my honourable friend from
Vancouver South, I think he was guilty of the
same kind of offence-if it is an offence. After
pointing out that the purpose of the sales tax
was to provide revenue for public purposes,
he said:
There is no country in the world which does as
much as Canada by way of providing funds for the
care of the needy and indigent.

Mind you, honourable senators, the sales
tax on margarine yielded last year a revenue
of about one and one half million dollars;
but my honourable friend from Vancouver
South went on to call attention to the cost of
family allowances, which he estimated at
$300 million a year. The honourable gentleman from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)whose one fault is a dislike of margarineinterjected that the cost was $307 million.
Then my honourable friend from Vancouver
South enumerated a number of other items

in the social security program paid for out
of public revenues-old age pensions, unemployment insurance, and so on, the annual
cost of which is possibly $600 million or
maybe $700 million, and to refer to these
expenditures right after mentioning the
revenue from the sales tax on margarine is
to invite the conclusion-whether my honourable friend intended it or not-that if we
abolish the margarine sales tax, which last
year produced one and a half million dollars,
this whole structure of social security will
collapse. Well it is only necessary to state
that proposition to realize how ridiculous it is.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Then my honourable
friend went on to quote from a newspaper
report of a statement made in Ottawa by an
American doctor, which indicates how difficult
it is for some people to accept an indisputable
fact-the indisputable fact in this case being
that margarine is a wholesome and nutritious
article of food. It is interesting to note that
away back in 1885, or 1886, the very year in
which a restrictive measure was introduced
in Canada, there was introduced in the United
States an Act which declared margarine
to bu a wholesome and nutritious food. But
some people in Canada are still contending
to the contrary, even after our Supreme
Court has declared invalid the statute prohibiting the manufacture and sale of margarine, and even though margarine is being
manufactured here and the governments of
all the provinces except Quebec have passed
regulations to insure that the product shall
comply with pure food standards. Quebec
has taken a firm stand, having simply said
that no margarine shall be manufactured or
sold within its boundaries.
May I digress here to express a little
wonder as to why my honourable friend from
Belford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) was so concerned
yesterday about the effect that the removal
of the sales tax on margarine might have
upon the farmers of his province? Although
no margarine can be made or sold in that
province, he almost shed tears when he pictured the consequences that the removal of
this sales tax would have upon farmers in
his district with twenty-five or fifty head of
cattle. I will not attempt to predict what
might happen in Quebec, but margarine has
been welcomed in the other provinces, and,
I feel sure regardless of what the vote on
this motion may be, that any federal government which in future dared to cut off the
people of Canada from access to margarine
would invite public condemnation when the
people next went to the polls.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Not at all.

MAY 11, 1950

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Let us come back to the
suggestion that margarine is not as good as
butter. My honourable friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) yesterday read
an excerpt from the Ottawa Citizen, and
quoted a Dr. Segard. Well, I wish now to
speak with all the authority in the worldand it is comforting to know that the Department of National Health agrees with me on
this point. In paragraph 4 of the order of
reference rde
by the government to the
Supreme Court of Canada ýon the question of
whether or not the Dominion of Canada had
authority and power to prohibit the importation, manufacture or sale of margarine, we
find this language:
The undersigned-

That is the Clerk of the Privy Council.
-further reports that the Department of National
Health and Welfare submits with its approval the
following extract from an article contained in the
Canadian Medical Association Journal of August,
1947, respecting margarine:
"One factor absent in vegetable oils is Vitamin A,
and if the lack of this could not be remedied it
would seriously weaken the value of margarine.
But it is quite easy to add as much Vitamin A as is
needed, and to make margarine contain more of
this vitamin than the richest butter Even butter
is liable to show seasonal variations in its content
of Vitamin A. Other vitamins too could be added
to margarine such as Vitamin D, for example, of
which butter contains very little. As a source of
energy, margarine and butter are exactly equal.
Perhaps one of the main difficulties encountered
with margarine in the early days of its development
was that of its taste. That bas now been so completely overcome that it is difficult to distinguish
between butter and margarine. Even if it was
making a virtue of wartime necessity, Britain found
no difficulty in learning to like as well as depend
on margarine during the war period."

The paragraph goes on to give the percentage content. So, in answer to my honourable
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), I call as my witness the Department
of National Health and Welfare, supported
by the article appearing in the Canadian
Medical Association Journal.
We are also told that if one eats margarine
eye defects will occur in the third generation.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is a good one!
Hon. Mr. Hayden: All I have to do to
answer that proposition is point to the excellent representatives we have here from the
new Canadian province of Newfoundland.
These honourable gentlemen have enjoyed
margarine for a long time, and, from my
observation, they must be of at least the third
generation. I fail to see any defects developing in them.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They eat plenty of fish.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Nor have I heard of the
people of Denmark, England or the United
States suffering from the use of margarine.
Hon. Mr. Horner: None of the Newfoundrepresentatives in this house has ever tasted
margarine.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Let them speak for
themselves. I will have something te say to
my honourable friend from Blaine Lake in
a minute.
My point is that the wholesomeness and
nutritive value of margarine as compared
with butter is something that can always be
determined, and, if necessary, be regulated
by the food and drug laws of Canada. We
are not at all concerned with the question of
whether or not we should have margarine.
The whole issue is whether or not, in the circumstances, it should be exempted from a
sales tax of 3 cents a pound.
My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) talks about this
insignificant amount of three cents a pound,
and asks why we should bother so much
about it. I had the same thought. He was
so aggressive and vehement in discussing
one side of the question, that I thought I
could develop at least a little enthusiasm for
what was to be said on the other side. I can
remember that once upon a time the small
sum of five cents caused a controversy which
lasted over many years. As to the three cents
involved in this issue, unless there is a
change of attitude on the part of the authorities, it will weigh heavily on the minds of
the consumers of Canada who are most concerned about the cost of their daily diet.
In passing I cannot resist asking what there
is about canned shrimp that entitles it to
a sales tax exemption that is not extended
to margarine?
Hon. Mr. Wood: It is not a manufactured
product.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Two wrongs do not
make a right.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They are still shrimps.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I refrain from making
a remark which might offend.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: You are getting a little
far away from the subject.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: We have been told in
the course of the debate that vegetable oils
are brought in from the United States. Well,
shrimps are imported from Louisiana, and
dried dates come from the Far East.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: But there is no question
of competition.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Let us be realistic and
get down to a matter of dollars and cents.

SENATE
I point out to my honourable friend that
the United States has faced the issue in a
most realistic way. There the federal and
state authorities imposed special taxes upon
margarine, and if in certain states colour
was added there was a further tax. That is
why the expedient of attaching a little pellet
of colouring matter to the product for use
by the housewife was adopted. The United
States government

Hon. Mr. Farris: Take it both ways.

and the well-being of the great agricultural

not appreciate value of dairying to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That may be so, but you
do not understand it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is what my honour-

able friend thinks, and it is one of the difficulties we have to deal with. Some of those
who represent the farmers' interests seem to

MAY 11, 1950
believe that nobody but themselves understands the problem. Maybe I do not, but I
credit myself with being at least ordinarily
intelligent.
The April issue of the Canadian Statistical
Review, which is issued by the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics, is my authority for the
following information. In 1939 farm income
from all sources, including grains, livestock
and dairy produce, amounted to a little less
than $700 million. The years between 1938
and 1948 showed a steady progression of
increase until 1949, when this income had
risen to nearly $2,500 million. Referring to a
chart which is available to anybody, and
has been seen, I suppose, by other senators, I
find that during the same period returns from
dairy products stand to total receipts in the
proportion of about one-sixth. It may be
that if a substantial part of this income is
lost, and cannot be replaced, some problens
will arise; but I cannot agree that there is
any problem at this time. Admittedly, during
the past year the government had to buy a
quantity of butter, in conformity with its
policy, under the Agricultural Prices Support
Act, to establish and maintain floor prices.
I supported that measure. But I say that
when one looks at the over-all picture, no
justification can be found for the theory that
because margarine may deprive butter producers of some part of their market, the price
of margarine should be made as high as
possible in order to reduce the effect of
that competition.
An Hon. Senator: The market will be
affected if colouring is allowed.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Do not let us get into
another side issue. The matter of colouring
is in the jurisdiction of the provinces, and
various provinces have imposed regulations
with respect to it. So far as I am concerned
I do not care what colour it is. Maybe in time
an ivory tint will be selected and become
very attractive to the consumer.
Someone has suggested that attempts are
made to pass off margarine as butter. All one
has to do to expose the weakness of that
argument is to read the statutes of the various provinces and note the regulations which
hedge about the use of margarine. Even
restaurants which serve it are required to
carry a statement to that effect in a conspicuous place on their menus. When you walk
into a store and find that the packages bear
the trade name of margarine, all the display
matter discloses this fact, you will have to
agree that the suggestion of "passing off" or
of attempting to deceive is idle and nonsensical.
People buy margarine because they want
it, and small restrictions such as this tax,

will have no more effect in shutting off the
demand for margarine than an attempt to
sweep back the Atlantic ocean. The demand
for margarine bas existed for some time;
it is very general; and so long as the price
of butter remans at its present level, there
will be millions of people who cannot afford
to buy that product. Why should they be
deprived of the right to obtain an equally
wholesome and nutritious article of food at
the cheapest price for which it can be had?
I have spoken longer than I intended, but
I should like to deal with one or two other
points.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yesterday the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
was chided for suggesting that excellent
margarine could be manufactured in Canada
from vegetable oils produced in this country.
There was quite a discussion between him
and the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) about that statement and my honourable friend's purpose in
making it. I remember that in 1948, during
a debate on this subject, the government
leader in this chamber (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
after a very lengthy review of the vegetable
oil situation-including pages of statistics
which will be found in the debates for that
year-came to the conclusion that it was idle
for us to consider making it legal to manufacture margarine in Canada, because the
necessary oils were not available. We know
that within four or five weeks after the prohibitory legislation was declared invalid,
margarine was on the shelves of Canadian
stores.
Now I have tried to restrict my remarks to
the facts of the situation and to keep expressions of opinion to a minimum. If we cannot divorce from this discussion questions of
competition between butter and margarine,
and if we do not recognize that the Excise Tax
Act was never intended to correct competitive
conditions as between products, we cannot
intelligently consider this resolution. If anyone feels that there is here a competitive
situation which should be corrected, he is at
perfect liberty to raise that issue; but not as
an argument against taking off the sales tax. It
would be a prostitution of the purpose for
which the sales tax was devised to require
people to pay more than they should for
margarine merely because the removal of the
tax would increase competition with butter.
The honourable senator from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) seemed to derive some
comfort from an argument which attempted
to relate our customs duties to this problem
of excise tax. What I said a little while ago
applies equally to this contention. Customs

SENATE
tariffs are devised for raising revenue and
as measures of protection. Where existing
scales of protection are inadequate, further
measures may be imposed to provide the
necessary degree of protection. But it is no
argument against the remission of the sales
tax on margarine to say that were the customs duty taken off some other item, that
item might be had in Canada for a lower
price. The purpose of a customs tariff is
enitirely different from that of an excise tax.
The latter is solely designed for revenue
purposes and is in no way intended to provide
an element of protection.
In my opinion this question is not based on
the competitive position of margarine and
butter. In accordance with our laws both
are manufactured and sold in Canada. I
miaintaiýn that there is no competitive issue
here in which the government, in the national
interests of the country should interfere.
But should there be such a competitive
issue, then the government should deal with
it on Ithat basis. I think that the Agricultural
Prices Support Act was designed to deal with
exactly this kind of situation.
Whether it is in the interests of Canada
to remove the sales tax on margarine is a
question which should only be considered in
relation to the purposes for which the Excise
Tax Act was devised and the sales tax
instituted. Can we, in the interest of Canada's
revenues, afford to give up this item of
income which last year amounted to $1l
million? If the government consider that this
burden weighs too heavily on our population,
then they should remove the sales tax from
margarine.
Now-although I sometimes enjoy getting
worked up a little bit-I think we should be
able to discuss these questions without showing too much emotion. When we come down
to it, I think the real question is this: Should
Canada's consumers whose incomes are at
different levels be allowed to buy margarine
at the lowest possible price at which it can
be offered to them? My honourable friend
from Vancouver South said that if our people
can afford to buy automobiles they can afford
to pay the price asked for butter; but all
Canadians do not drive around in automobiles,
neither are they able to afford butter. In
these circumstances, therefore, I think they
should be able to secure margarine without
having to pay this sales tax.
I will go further and say that whether
people are hungry or whether they can afford
to buy butter, there is nothing inherent in
the law of economics or in the principles of
liberalism-and I spell that with a small "1"
and a capital "L"-which says that we should
shut off people from a wholesome and nutritious food, or deliberately set about to unduly

increase the price of that food in order to
maintain a market for a competitive product.
If we want to do this, then let us be realistic
and face the problem, and not adopt, as an
expedient, something that was never intended
for the purpose. Honourable senators, in all
these circumstances I support this resolution.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I just ask the honourable senator one question? Nearly everyone in this country owns a shirt. Would my
honourable friend deny that the object of a
customs tariff is to protect the industry interested in the making of shirts?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend was not listening to me, because that is exactly what I
said,-that the customs duty was intended for
protection as well as for revenue purposes.
But I said that the sales tax under the Excise
Tax Act was designed solely for the purpose
of acquiring revenue. I say it is a prostitution
of the purpose of the sales tax to argue that
it should be invoked for the purposes of
protection.
Hon. Gustave Lacasse: Honourable senators, I do not wish to prolong this discussion,
but I welcome the opportunity to briefly
state my position with regard to the matter
before the house. I must do this so as to
be honest with my colleagues and with the
general public of Canada.
In the early stages of this debate I found
myself, like my honourable friend from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies), under the
impression that the proponents of this resolution were basing their arguments exclusively on fiscal grounds, and I was inclined
to vote against the motion. Having noticed,
however, that the debate has since become a
revival of the old margarine issue of two and
three years ago-margarine versus butter,
labour versus industry, city versus countryI now find myself ready to support the motion
in order to be consistent with myself.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: As suggested by the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), I think this issue is mostly, if not
entirely, a fiscal one.
I marvel that such a despicable food as
margarine has been able to provoke such high
feelings and heated debate in a house of
parliament which has the reputation of being
serene. Apparently butter and margarine
have a stimulating effect of which I was not
aware. I am not the son or grandson, father
or grandfather of any Canadian dairy indus-

try mogul, and I do not hold a brief for the
Canadian manufacturers of margarine. Thus
I have always been able to approach this

MAY 11, 1950
problem in a most disinterested way. I have
listened attentively and with an open mind
to those who have spoken in this debate. I
was even prepared to change my stand if
I thought I should; but the arguments
advanced by those in favour of butter have
been such that I now feel that I must, in all
sincerity, fall back to my old position and
stick to my guns.
In the course of this debate many references have been made to statements uttered
by honourable members in the course of
former discussion on this issue. Just to amuse
myself, and perhaps some other honourable
members, may I refer to at least two statements made in days gone by in this very
chamber by the foes of margarine? Did they
not say that if margarine should obtain
favourable consideration, we would not see
it on the Canadian market for months, maybe
years? But six months later margarine was
being sold on the Canadian market. This is
one illustration of the solemn pronouncements that members of the house have made
without foundation, and I say this with due
respect to all concerned. I am convinced that
another statement fnade during this debate
was no more based on fact when it was repeated than it was when it was first made. We
have been told repeatedly in violent terms and
challenging expressions, that when margarine
came on the Canadian market it would be the
doom of butter and the ruination of the dairy
industry. In spite of the assurance given, I
was never convinced that that was the fact. I
have not made any researches into the matter,
and I have no figures, but I feel that whatever
the dairy industry may lose in competition
with margarine will be more than made up by
the extra demand created by the immigrants
who are flocking to Canada. There are today
almost 400,000 new butter eaters in Canada,
who have come here from abroad, and the
number is increasing steadily.
One reason why I have favoured legalization of the manufacture and sale of margarine
ever since the first bill was introduced here
by my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) is that the district where I live is
mainly .composed of factory workers, and they
cannot afford butter for the sandwiches that
make up at least one of their meals nearly
every day of the year. It is true that they
are paid high wages, but they have many children to feed, and rather than deprive their
children of butter they do without it themselves.
I do not think the opinions of scientific men
as to the nutritive value of margarine should
be considered by us at all. The medical
profession is divided on this question. We
ail must admit that butter is the better food,
55950-22

for its principal ingredient, milk is itself
scientifically described as the rnost complete
food. At the same time we all must admit
that margarine is a nutritious food. The
authority who came here from the United
States and expressed his views as to the
food value of margarine was answered by the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), to my satisfaction at least, if not to
the satisfaction of all concerned.
May I suggest here, with as much discretion
as I can command, that some of our colleagues,
particularly those from Quebec and Nova
Scotia, should divert some of their energy to
bringing about improvement in the production
and distribution of milk within their provinces, and especially to have pasteurization
made compulsory, as it is in Ontario? With
all respect to my honourable friends, I say
that because I know from official statistics
that infant mortality rises or falls according
to the quality of the milk supply. I should
point out that the infant mortality rate in the
province of Quebec has greatly improved
recently, but I believe there would be far
greater improvement if pasteurization of milk
were made compulsory.
I will conclude by saying that I intend to
support the motion. I hope that nothing I
have said has offended anyone, even my good
friends from British Columbia, Quebec,
Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: How about Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Apropos of Newfoundland, may I tell a little story? It may be
of some interest, and it certainly pertains
to the discussion that we have been having.
During the war I received from my boy,
who was then stationed in Newfoundland,
a postcard bearing a picture of four cows.
At the bottom of the card my boy had
written, "Dad, take off your hat to the four
princesses of Newfoundland." The inference
I drew was that the dairy industry on the
island was at a very low ebb. This may
explain why margarine is so popular there.
It may also explain why Newfoundland
insisted that the terms of union with Canada
contain certain provisions favourable to
margarine.
I trust that nothing I have said will cause
the discussion to be prolonged. I thought it
right to explain my position and to show
that in voting for the motion of my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
my action is consistent with the stand that
I have taken in the past.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I have listened with much pleasure to this
debate, especially to the speeches of my

SENATE

honourable friends from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard), Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) and Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). It
struck me that the senator from TorontoI do not know whether he is the junior or
the senior senator from that city-was not
in his usual form. As a rule he is a constructive speaker, but today he devoted himself entirely to hammering the honourable
gentleman from Vancouver South. I took
that as confirmation of my own view that
the speech made yesterday by the senator
from Vancouver South was a pretty able
one.
I was much interested in some remarks
of the speaker who immediately preceded
me, my honourable friend from WindsorHon. Mr. Lacasse: Essex.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, my honourable friend
lives in or close to Windsor. He stated that
industrial workers in that city could not
afford to buy butter, whereas I had always
understood that the wage rate in that city
was the highest in Canada. If I air. right,
and if those people cannot afford to buy
butter, then nobody in the country can
afford it.
I had expected to vote for this motion,
but as the debate proceeded it became clear
to me that the issue was not whether a small
tax should or should not be removed from
a food product, but whether we should endorse margarine as a substitute for butter.
That is the issue, and on that issue I have
no trouble in deciding how I shall vote.
There is no question that the giving of
further encouragement to margarine would
result in an attack on one of the basic and
fundamental industries of this country. It
is being attacked right now. The trade this
year is running at about ten million pounds
a month, and butter cannot be sold at a price
low enough to overcome that competition.
My honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) has referred to the floor under
the price of butter. Well, we have seen that
as soon as the floor is lowered by five cents
a pound the retail price drops accordingly.
I am persuaded that if there were no floor
at all-and it is not going to be possible to
have one indefinitely-the price of butter
would drop to thirty-four or thirty-five cents.
I agree with what was said the other day
by my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that if the competition of margarine succeeds in killing
the butter business, we shall no longer have
any dairy herds in this country; and in that
event we shall certainly suffer from a great
scarcity of fluid milk.

Hon. Mr. Horner: And we may then have

to pay fifty cents a pound for margarine.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.

I, for one, shall always feel that it is our
duty to protect the basic industries of this
country.
The manufacture of margarine
is certainly not a basic industry. As a
Westerner I have been troubled all my
political life because the implements and
other goods that our farmers need are
obtainable only on protected markets, whereas farm products are sold on the open market.
My attempt, though perhaps feeble, always
has been to try to solve the problem created
by allowing a commodity manufactured in
our country to drive out a basic agricultural
industry.
My honourable friend frem Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) gave us some figures on the
income of the farmers over the past ten
years. But why did he not go back another
ten years? In 1946 wheat was selling on
the world market for $2.33 a bushel, and
in 1947 it brought $2.89 a bushel. Everybody knows that that was a post-war market,
and that American money was being provided
for the purchase of the best food in the world,
wheat. But the dairy industry is fundamental.
There is not a single province in Canada, with
the possible exception of Newfoundlandwith which I am net familiar-where it is
not a basic industry.
My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said he knew something about farming. Well, I will tell him
that many years ago, in order to buy tea,
sugar and other things required in the home,
I rode on horseback to the store, carrying with
me three pounds of butter that my mother had
made to sell there. I know how basic the
production of butter is to a farming conmunity.
Of course it is good business to buy oleomargarine at 35 cents a pound when butter
is selling at 55 cents a pound, but if you
remove the floor price from butter what will
happen? I predict that ultimately the government will have to remove the floor price,
for it cannot carry the huge surpluses of
butter that will pile up. Then the price will
go down-as I believe one of my honourable
friends frorn Saskatchewan said-as low as
twelve and a half cents a pound. My friend
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said he
could remember when a pound of butter
could be bought for 15 cents.
I believe the honourable senator from
Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) hit the nail on
the head in his remarks. But I fail to understand why such a fight is being made to
remove two and a half or three cents from
the cost of margarine, when it can now be

MAY 11, 1950
bought for 20 cents a pound less than butter.
If margarine is just as good as butter, as
we are told by some people, why does anyone buy butter?
My friend says that, as a matter of logic,
if one item of food is exempt from tax another
should be. I agree with him, and on that
basis I had decided to vote in favour of this
resolution. But the debate has drifted far
beyond that proposition.
After listening to the remarks of the
honourable senators from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner), from Mount Stewart (Hon. Mr.
McIntyre) and from Prince (Hon. Mr.
Barbour)-all of whom spoke as farmers
who began humbly, and therefore know the
basic industries of the farm-I am more than
convinced that we are in the throes of the
old struggle of margarine versus butter. I
come from a city where, no doubt, many
people buy margarine; but I believe that
the farmers are the backbone of this country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I believe that if we do not
stand behind them one hundred per cent we
just hurt ourselves, and that in the end we
will have peasant-farmers on our land.
Throughout the history of Canada the rural
areas have given outstanding men and women
to all branches of society in this countryincluding the clergy, the law and medicineand the early education of many of our
leaders was secured with the help of the
humble cow.
I intend to vote against the resolution.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Surely!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was hoping that the
debate would be confined to the question of
margarine as a food product, but it bas
developed into a discussion of margarine
versus butter. The remarks of the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
clearly brought the old struggle home to me.
Apparently it also -had an effect on the
honourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse), but in the reverse..
For the reasons I have given, honourable
members, I shall vote against the resolution.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Sone Hon. Senators: Question!
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators I
may say that I am not surprised at the
declaration made by the leader opposite, for
it is not the first time he has changed his
mind on this subject.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And it will not be the
last.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps not, though I
am rather doubtful that he will change his
55950--221

mind again on the particular question before
us. He stated that originally he had intended
to vote for the motion, but that because
the issue has been changed into a controversy
between margarine and butter, he is now
going to vote against the motion. I shall
answer the honourable leader opposite, and,
then leave the question to the judgment of
this house. If the issue has been changedand so far as I am concerned it has not-it
has been changed because of the remarks
made by those opposed to the motion.
I do not intend to speak at length at
this time, because I think the senators will
agree that I have had a great deal to say
on this subject in the past three or four
years. I have no desire to impose myself
unnecessarily on the patience of the house,
and since the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) has, in my opinion, made
a complete and devastating reply to the
speeches of the member from Vancouver
South and the member from Grandville, there
is not a great deal left for me to say.
The remarks of the senator from Vancouver
South-and I am sorry that at the moment
he is absent from the chamber-were to me
surprising, interesting and at times even
amusing. I was astonished that my innocuous motion, which means exactly what
it says, with no sinister implications, should
arouse such furious opposition. The member
from Vancouver South, speaking in what he
termed a tremulous voice-which is rather
unexpected on the part of a distinguished
lawyer, if he has a good case-finally whipped
himself into such a state of excitement that
I seriously began to wonder what was the
motive behind it all.
This simple motion has provoked a good
deal of inconsequential and entirely unAs the member from
justified debate.
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has said, it is
merely a question of deciding whether or
not we are in favour of removing the sales
tax from margarine. In my closing remarks
I shall perhaps digress a bit because, as the
leader opposite has said, the issue bas been

adequate reply has been made to the
opponents of this resolution.
The member from Vancouver South yesterday quoted from a speech I made two
years ago, to the effect that the Canadian
farmers could produce the materials from
which vegetable oils such as sunflower-seed
oil, rapeseed oil and soybean oil, could be
obtained for the making of excellent margarine. Like the acute lawyer that he is,
he pounced upon the word "would", which
I had used once more or less casually, but
which I later amplified. I asked my friend to
read my later remarks; and when he did,

a combine. There are laws to deal with combines: and in -the absence of arrangements
of this kind I believe we can be assured that
competition will put the price where it ought
to be.
The honourable senator from Grandville
says that we have no assurance that the
benefit of the exemption from the three cents
tax would go to the consumer. I ask him
whether there is any commodity sold in this
country and about which one can be sure that,
in the case of a tax reduction, the benefit
would be carried to the consumer. Again the
fact of competition comes in. Would he argue
that a gover..ment which already has an
excessive number of employees should send
to every business in this country an investigator who would poke his nose into every
transaction to determine whether the manufacturer was making a fair profit on his
product? My friend also says he suspectsthat margarine manufacturers are charging
all the traffic will bear, and making too big
profit. Does he not know that as a general
thing under our system of free. enterprise,
the producer of any article-and I do not
except the wheat farmer or the cattle nantries to get all he can for what he has to
sell? Of course he does: that is the very
genius of individual enterprise. If ever it
became official policy to cut the profit out of
production, we might as well join another
party, and I do nt nc
men Ie Cno,
the
party.
My friend also said that there were items
other than martarine from which t e sales
tax could be re.noved with more beneacial
results; and he seemed to imply hat an
attempt was beisg made to give this product
special treaîment; that there was to e an
exception in Ihis case. Yes, there is an exception, but it works entirely in reverse. Stargarine is the one lone orphan food upon
which a sales tax is charged. In support of
what was said by my honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) as to the principle which guides the administration in this
matter, I will read a passage from the budget
speech of the Minister of Finance of May 18,
1948, as reported in House of Commons
Hansard, page 4067:
In the field of commodity taxes, I have felt it
necessary to frame my proposais in the light of the
government's general fiscal program, and am, therefore, not proposing any sweeping or drastic reductions in tax rates. I have considered, however,
whether anything might be done by way of a direct
contribution toward reducing the cost of living at
one of those points where it has been felt most
acutely, that is, in the cost of food, and where it
would create little additional inflationary pressure.
As a positive step in this direction I have decided
to propose to parliament that substantially all of
the items of food not now exempt from the sales
tax be put on the exempt list from tomorrow
onward.

That is a declaration of government policy,
and I felt that it would be opportune for me
to introduce this resolution at the present
session, because the minister had announced
in the budget that ice cream, which was
formerly regarded as a luxury, would be
added to the list of foods exempt from sale
tax.
I say without hesitation and without any
desire to be offensive, that when this sort of
thing is done-that is, excluding margarine
from exemption-the motive is entirely
political. And this is what I maintained
as to the opposition raised to the Dairy
Industry Bills which I introduced in this
house on former occasions.
I should like to give an illustration of
one of the inaccurate remarks made by my
friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard).
We had a little controversy across the floor
of the house as to the foodstuffs that were
exempt from sales tax, and he insisted that
sugar was not exempt from this tax.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am ready to admit to
my honourable friend that sugar is certainly
exempt. The exchange was pretty rapid,
and what I had in mind at that moment was
the customs tax.
Hon. Mr. -Euler: Oh, but we distinguished
those too.
Hn". Mr. Bouffard: Yes, I know, but the
discussion was moving quickly.
I quite
admit that my friend was right.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then il will not be necessary for me to send him a copy of the Excise'
Tax Act to show that sugar is among the
exempted items?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have not had muche
opportunity to examine the speech of my
honourable
friend from Grandville
in
Hansard, but I have marked certain points
which I wish to bring to the attention of
the house. In one instance he said:
The agricultural industry in this country is going
to be ruined.

I said: "Nonsense". I should not have
interrupted him, but I have no reason to
retract that exclamation.
I could make a number of comments about
the address delivered by the senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), but I
shall just touch the highlights because his
speech was well answered by the senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). He said:
If margarine is just as good as butter . . .

Weil, this should not be a discussion of the
relative merits of margarine and butter.
There is no doubt that some margarine is

SENATE

as good or better than some butter, and
that some butter is as good or better than
some margarine. That is not the question
at all. My argument has always been that
if you or I want to buy a food that is
admittedly good and wholesome, no democratic government in this country of ours
should say "Nay", or legislate against one
product in order to benefit another with
which it is in competition.
My friend from Vancouver South had this
to say:
If margarine is just as good as butter, then there
is no discrimination against margarine consumers,
because they can buy it much cheaper than butter.

Yes, they can, but not as cheaply as they

could if the sales tax were removed from
margarine.

He continued by saying:
On the other hand, if margarine is not as good as
butter, people should not be allowed to buy it.

Well, liver and sausage are not as good as
filet mignon or roast beef, but surely you
would not have a law to provide that if a
person cannot afford to buy beefsteak he
must not buy liver or sausage, or something
else which is the only thing he can afford
to buy? Surely this philosophy is not becoming to one who is a member of the Liberal
party. When he says, "If margarine is not
:as good as butter, people should not be
:allowed to buy it" he must apply this argu.ment to all things; then if one product is
not as good as another with which it is in
competition, the government should step in
and prohibit it.
My friend then went on to ask me what
right there is to colour margarine yellow. I
do not like to discuss this subject to any
extent, but my friend introduced it in debate
by saying:
Does it have any relation to the question involved
in the resolution? At first I thought not; but now
I think that it relates to the implications behind the
resolution. It is part of the onward movement to
entrench margarine and destroy the dairy farmers.

I resent that sort of statement because it has

no foundation in fact. When I introduced this
resolution, I did so only for the purpose of
trying to reduce the cost of a product that
the people of this country want, and to have
it placed on the same basis as other foodstuffs.
My honourable friend from Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Nicol) spoke of the price of beef. He
said that if margarine destroyed the sale of
butter the farmers would sell all their cattle,
and people would have to pay more for beef.
He should know that a few years ago there
was an embargo against beef cattle going to
the United States, and my honourable friends
opposite-and I rather sympathize with them

-were very much opposed to that embargo
and were of the opinion that it should be
removed.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Absolutely.

Hon. Mr. Euler: And under pressure-I
shall not say it was a pressure-group, although
it might have been-the government of
Canada decided to remove that embargo.
What was the result? Beef cattle by the
hundreds of thousands crossed the border; the
farmers were paid in American money, and
the price of beef in Canada went up. While
in Canada, cows are not sold to any great
extent for beef, our dairy farmers for a
number of years now have not been raising
cows for the sole purpose of producing milk
and making butter and cheese; they have been
exporting their cattle to the United States,
South America and other countries at prices
ranging from $250 to $300 a head. I do not
blame them for having done this. It is their
right if we are to have a free economy.
I said the other day that the whole trend
of the wcrld is toward greater freedom of
trade. A few years ago we participated in a
trade conference at Geneva, where the principle upon which the whole negotiations were
founded was that no nation should have a
prohibitive tariff against the products of any
other nation.

More recently a meeting was

held at Havana, and I believe our Canadian
reprosentatives are already on their way to a
trade conference to be held at Torquay,
England.
I think it was my honourable friend from
Vancouver South who made the statement
that he would not allow foreign raw products
to be brought into Canada.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not think I said that.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It was the honourable

member from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard).
Hon. Mr. Euler: Just consider what this
would mean, if vegetable oils, for instance,
were not admitted. What would happen? If
you impose an embargo on vegetable oils,
why not prohibit other raw materials? Do
honourable senators realize what this would
lead to in Canada? We are more dependent
upon the exports of raw materials than any
other country in the world. And do honourable members think that if we prohibited the
importation of raw materials of certain kinds
from the United States that retaliatory
measures would not follow? What would the
result be in the province of Quebec if the
United States prohibited the importation of
newsprint, which is one of our most valuable
exports? And what would happen to Canada
as a whole if we were not able to export our
nickel, our copper, our lead or, if you like, our
cattle?

MAY 11. 1950
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I simply said that I
thought that any raw material which was
imported from a foreign country and that
competed with a natural product here should
be taxed.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I accept my honourable
friends statement that that is what he
intended to say, although it is not exactly
what he said. However, I would point out
that if we prevent the importation of goods
from other countries we shall reduce our
own exports. And that would be to act in
direct opposition to the view that now prevails all over the world, namely, that in
order to prosper we must promote international trade, which, as everybody knows,
means buying goods from other countries as
well as selling to them.
I have spoken longer than I intended. The
real issue here is whether we shall have the
sales tax removed from margarine. We have
talked around that subject: we have talked
about colouring and other things which
have nothing at all to do with my motion;
certainly a good many red herrings have
been dragged across the trail by opponents
of the resolution, and some, possibly, of its
supporters. But one thing is sure: the whole
opposition to the bills for the legalization of
margarine and to this motion has arisen
from the desire to avoid competition with
butter. That is the plain fact.
I will not discuss the contention that the
sale of margarine will ruin our farmers, for
I do not believe that at all. Margarine is
sold in the United States, Great Britain,
Denmark, France and all the other countries
of the world, and the farmers there have
not been ruined.
In conclusion, I say that we have margarine
in Canada and it is here to stay.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My honourable friend is
entitled to his own opinion.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Certainly.

Hon. Mr. Euler: International trade is supposed to benefit those who sell as well as
those who buy.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Our experience in past
years shows that as soon as anything imported
into the United States from Canada affects an
American industry, a tax is clapped down
on it.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.

RED RIVER FLOODS
CONDITIONS IN WINNIPEG

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable
senators, before the orders of the day are
proceeded with, I ask leave to move the
adjournment of this house to discuss a matter
of urgent public importance, namely, the
Winnipeg flood.
The Hon. the Speaker: Shall the honourable
senator have leave to proceed?
Some Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable ,senators, it
is difficult for me to convey to anyone the
picture as I saw it last week of the awful
eflects of the Red River flood. Almost all
business is at a standstill in a city and district
of 300,000 people. It is true that Rimouski
suffered a serious loss, estimated at $20
million, partly covered by insurance; but in

MAY 16, 1950
Winnipeg and its environs the loss incurred
is more than $100 millions, not in any way
covered by insurance.
In its winding length from Emerson at the
boundary to below Winnipeg, over 70 miles
away, the Red River-ordinarily 300 to 600
feet in width-is in some places almost 20
miles wide. At Morris it is 14 miles wide.
Cattle are gone -and farms are completely
covered. The only place in Morris that is
above water is the station. At Winnipeg it
has been necessary to send 100,000 people out
of town, and more are to leave just as soon
as they can be provided for. The citizens are
working like mad to build up the dikesand the worst is not yet over.
A similar fiood occurred in 1948 and, though
not as bad as the present flood, it caused
great loss and suffering. A great deal of the
flood loss is permanent, because no one would
want to buy a house where twice in two years
mud and slime had been washed in through
its windows. Re-sale values are permanently
destroyed.
Now, the point I come to is this: this water
all comes from the United States, and if our
melting snows and rain flowed south, we
would be asked to assume some or all of the
responsibility for the damage. Therefore the
United States must assume some of the
liability for the present damage, and I implore
our leader to at once request the International
Joint Waterways Commission to ask the government of the United States to not only make
a contribution in answer to our call for help
but also to take steps, not next year, but
immediately, to see that something is done
to prevent flooding again next year.
May I read a few words from an item
appearing in a local newspaper? The article
somewhat upset me, but I quote it without
any raneour or insinuations.
The United States army has made a total of
1,000,000 sandbags available to the Canadian government for purchase for use in the fight against Manitoba's floods, it was disclosed yesterday.

The bags were made available for purchase,

mind you, although the waters that we are
trying to hold back come from the United
States. This indicates that the American
authorities do not fully appreciate the situation, and I would urge our leader to see that
their attention is called to it, so that they
may take a full share of the responsibility.
For the information of this honourable body
I wish to place certain figures on the record.
The elevation of the river at the boundary is
789 feet above sea level. At Winnipeg it is
757 feet, a drop of 32 feet. From Winnipeg to
St. Andrew's locks, which have an elevation
of 734 feet, there is a drop of 23 feet. The

dam at St. Andrew's may be partly responsible, but engineers say this is not the case.
From St. Andrew's to the town of Selkirk the
drop in the river is 10 feet, and from Selkirk
to Lake Winnipeg 12 feet, the elevation of
Lake Winnipeg being 712 feet. This makes
the total drop from the boundary 77 feet. I
am putting these figures on record, as they
may be of some use in discussing this very
important question.
If the dam at St. Andrew's locks holds back
the river, then let us have it blown up. If a
by-pass dredged around Winnipeg would
help, let it be done. Surely something can
make life in Winnipeg safer and more secure,
and restore some of the property values.
I do hope that this awful thing can be discussed here, so that the people of eastern
Canada can grasp the enormity of the loss,
and in some way help.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I will not discuss at length the merits of this
question. The flood has resulted in great loss
in the area between Emerson and Winnipeg.
It is my opinion that the farmers have not
only lost this year's crop and the greater
part of their livestock, but that most of their
machinery has been rusted or destroyed. Of
course their buildings have been flooded in
the same way as the city houses.
The villages such as Ste. Agathe, St. Jean,
Morris, and to some extent Letellier, have
suffered tremendous loss. Such villages as
Dominion City, Rose North, and other places
which have no means of protection, are in
very bad shape.
I am pleased that the honourable senator
from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson)
gave some figures in relation to the disaster.
I would call the attention of the house to a
meeting of the Finance Committee, held
about two weeks ago, at which the Deputy
Minister of Public Works for Canada was
present. Prior to that I had heard a rumour
from Winnipeg that the gates at the locks
were not open, but I did not believe it. When
I asked the deputy minister about this, he
said: "Senator Haig, the truth is that there is
a rock obstruction between Middlechurch and
St. Andrews locks, which are about five miles
apart." He added that there was no solution
until the body of water then present could get
away; in fact, he said that the gates were open
at that time. There was no shorthand report
taken of the evidence given at that committee
meeting, and I certainly never said anything
to anybody about it; but about a week later
the city engineer of the city of Winnipeg was
asked what he could suggest to prevent the
recurrence of this flood condition, and he
replied that the first step would be to blast

SENATE
the rock obstruction in the river between
Middlechurch and St. Andrews locks, at a
cost which he estimated to be about $20 million. It was his opinion that if this blasting
were done there would be no flood conditions
on the river north of Ste. Agathe, which is
about twenty miles south of Winnipeg. One
of my fellow senators to whom I was speaking expressed the thought that if the river
flowed freely from Ste. Agathe north, the
river south of Ste. Agathe would flow much
easier.
I readily admit that the cost of this suggested operation is high, but I note that an
experienced army engineer from the United
States said that even when flooding occurs
only once every fifty years, protection against
it is so valuable that it greatly outweighs
the cost.
The agricultural area from Emerson to
Winnipeg is probably one of the best farming
districts in the country. Through the years
the flood waters of the river have brought
with them deposits that fertilize the land;
and in this respect there is no doubt that
in the end the present flood will be beneficial.
In the meantime the people on that land
cannot get in this year's crop.
According to a letter which I have just
received from Winnipeg, it is estimated that
the water will not be off the land for three
weeks, which will be well into June, and
then some further time will elapse before
the land is dry enough to be seeded. Under
the circumstances I have little hope of any
land being planted this year in the Red
River Valley.
In the city of Winnipeg the problem is
slightly different. Houses built prior to 1935
are for the most part of frame construction,
with no insulation in the walls; but since 1940
all the buildings have been insulated with a
type of material that absorbs water.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Rock wool?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it is rock wool. That
insulating material is destroyed by the water,
and it may well be that the interiors of these
houses will have to be torn out and replaced.
I notice that the Minisýter of Reconstruction
said last night that it had been suggested
that the government take care of 75 per cent
of the cost of repairs to the houses on which
they have loans, and that the province take
care of the remaining 25 per cent. I think
they will have to do this for all the bouses
that have been damaged and not just the
ones in which they are interested.
Winnipeg depends on electricity for its
power. I would say that 75 per cent of the
meals of Winnipegers are cooked on electric

ranges, and all central heating in that city
is controlled by electricity.
During the
depression the government of the day granted
Winnipeg three and a half million dollars
to build an electrically-controlled sewage
disposal plant, and the instant the electricity
is cut off this whole system stops dead, and
of course a serious problem arises in a time
of flood. We experienced a bad flood in
1897 and we have had other floods which
were just trickles compared to the present
one. The Hydro Electric Company built
their transformer stations on the banks of the
river, five or six feet above the normal water
level, and while the dikes have been able
to hold back the water from St. Boniface,
even though the people in that area have
been evacuated, the real fight is to keep the
water away from these transformer stations.
If this can be accomplished the people will
have electricity to cook their meals and give
them light, and there will be power to pump
the water through the sewers.
A tremendous amount of Winnipeg's business comes from the rural districts, and the
success of our grain, dairy and distribution
industries are based on the prosperity of
these districts. The Red River Valley has
been one of the best revenue-producing areas
in the province. I know of a family of displaced persons who came to Manitoba two
years ago. They had just got settled on their
new farm and everything was going fine
when they were flooded out. When they were
brought in from Morris they said: "We went
through the Nazi camps in Germany and we
thought we had finally reached the heavenly
land; but the water came down on us and
forced us out, and now we do not know
what will become of us". They could not
speak English, but their story was interpreted
by officials of the Red Cross.
I want to say a word of praise about the
Red Cross. They have done a magnificent
job and there can be no complaint at all. The
army also have done a tremendous job, and
if it had not been for them-perhaps I
shall be criticized by my home-town papers
for saying this-the loss of life would have
been heavy. Their very presence gave
encouragement to the people, who felt that
they were being helped.
On behalf of the people of Manitoba I
want to thank the Government of Canada,
and Canadians generally, for contributing
money to the Flood Relief Fund. I assure
you that it will be well administered. The
man who has been named as treasurer of
the fund is the vice-president and general
manager of the Great West Life Insurance
Company, and is one of the ablest businessmen in Manitoba. I will not mention the

MAY 16, 1950
names of others who will administer this
money, but they are held in the highest regard
in our province.
I am delighted that the honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson)
brought up this matter, because the Manitoba
flood is the worst disaster ever suffered by
our people. My children have written to me
and described what an awful thing it is to
see the water gradually coming up towards
the houses. I know of an able young doctor
who just started to practise in Winnipeg.
His wife works for one of the local insurance
companies to help defray their living
expenses. They had to abandon their home
in Wildwood and move to St. Vital. Eventually they were flooded out there and I
shall not say anything about the house in
which they are now living. Their experience
is typical. The wife of this doctor said to
my daughter: "It is terrible to see the water
climbing up and up until finally somebody
comes and raps at your door and tells you
to get out. It is really awful."
Honourable senators, I hope that the Government of Canada will realize the seriousness of the set-back which the people of
Manitoba have suffered by reason of this
terrible disaster.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John C. Davis: Honourable senators,
in speaking to this motion I should like to
preface my remarks with an expression of
sympathy to the people of Rimouski and
Cabano for the losses they suffered in the
terrible fires that struck their towns.
The flood in the Red River Valley has
dealt Manitoba a real body blow. It first
swept through that part of the valley south
of Winnipeg, and its might is now concentrated on the city of Winnipeg. It is impossible
to estimate what the full loss will be. Various
amounts have been mentioned for the damage
done to Winnipeg and the losses suffered by
the market gardeners, mink ranchers and
other people along the banks of the Red
River as far as the United States border.
It is quite certain that the total damage will
run to one or two hundred million dollars.
As the Prime Minister has said, the losses of
the sufferers, will be met on some basis of
equity. Financial aid has been extended
without stint, by municipalities, provinces,
institutions and private individuals, and undoubtedly some scheme of repayment will be
devised.
In passing I might mention the peculiar
fact that I am the first professional engineer
who has ever had the privilege of occupying
a seat in this house since .confederation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Davis: This is the second time
that I have spoken here on an engineering
problem.
The situation in Winnipeg is not a new
one from the point of view of engineering
speculation, and the possible danger from
floods has been discussed at meetings of
engineers in Winnipeg for many years. I
remember that at one of our meetings some
years ago the late J. G. Sullivan, then Chief
Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway,
drew attention to the fact that at the rear
of one of the church buildings in St. Boniface
there is a high-water mark indicating that a
flood in the early nineteenth century rose to
a depth of between six and ten feet at the
corner of what is now Main street and
Portage avenue. And he said that the people
of Winnipeg would some day regret that their
city had been built on its present location,
that the first idea of the Canadian Pacific
Railway had been to locate it on higher
ground somewhere between Winnipeg and
Selkirk.
However, this disaster is upon us, and
remedies for the future have to be taken.
There are nearly 350,000 people in Greater
Winnipeg. For the time being their chance
to make a livelihood has gone, for business
and industry have stopped and gainful
occupations have ceased. I am not now talking
about businessmen or others who can stand
some strain. My sympathy goes to that class
of our population that has been spoken of
so often by the honourable member from
Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)-the
small man, the common labourer, who has no
means of livelihood except his hour-to-hour
wage. This man, the poor man, the "little Joe",
with his small wages has built up a little
home, from which he has been flooded out
while he was working on the dikes. He has
been labouring there without stint, receiving
no remuneration, and using the only assets
he has, the strength of his back and the
fibre of his arms and limbs, until in many
instances he has fallen in his tracks and
had to be carried away. The Army bas
done a magnificent job. So have the Air
Force and the Navy and the Red Cross; and
the St. John Ambulance Association must
not be overlooked. But this little man has
worked around the clock to save not only
the small things that he himself possesses
but the whole community, and we owe to him
a great debt.
I know some of these people, and I will
refer to one of them. He was working on
the dikes when he received word that his
own home, in the community of St. Vital,
was threatened. He left the dikes and hurried to his home, a small one-room placea little shack, if you like-and he got there

320

SENATE

barely in time to help his wife and seven
children escape in a truck, in which they
were taken by the Red Cross to higher
ground. Today he does not know where they
are, although undoubtedly they will be found.
This "little Joe" has gone back and is still
working on the dikes, giving all he has to
his fellows, without remuneration.
Furthermore, he does not know where his
unemployment relief book is. His employers
are disorganized and he cannot leave the
dikes. In the meantime he has no money
coming in, and so cannot afford relaxation
in the brief periods when he can be spared
from this most exhausting labour. I would
ask the honourable leader of the government
in this house to call this matter to the attention of the Minister of Labour and other
colleagues, with a view to having unemployment insurance benefits made immediately
available, without too much red tape, to
these men who need them so badly.
Also, I think that these poor men should
be able to get something to help them relax
when they come off the dikes. Because they
have no money with them they cannot afford
even to keep themselves in cigarettes during
these strenuous days. It seems to me that
at least the unemployment benefits which
they have built up over the years should be
made available to them immediately, and by
that I mean today or, at the latest, tomorrow
while they are striving to help relieve distress.
There is a lot of distress throughout the
flooded district, but fortunately one occasionally runs across a humorous incident.
I am not going to interject any humour into
this discussion, for I have not the ability
to do so, but perhaps honourable members
will allow me to relate a little incident.
The Archbishop of St. Boniface was labouring on the dikes, just like a common labourer,
filling sandbags for a man who was holding
them, one of our good half-breed citizens.
This man did not know who the Archbishop
was, but he felt that the technique used in
filling the sandbags was not all that could
be desired. After he had put up with this
as long as he could, he uttered an expletive
and shouted: "Tu devrais pas mettre tant de
sable dans ton sac, tu pourras pas le porter."
Though not in ecclesiastical language, the
advice was specific and, no doubt, duly noted.
The leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) touched upon the engineering problem.
For centuries the Red River has occasionally
gone on the rampage. Twice in the history
of my wife's family, who have lived in the
district a long time, they have had to move
up to Pine Ridge in order to escape spring
or early summer floods. It may be neces-

sary for us to build vast levees, such as have
been constructed to protect cities on the
lower Mississippi. Our problem cannot be
solved simply by removing four or six miles
of underlying rock in front of the Lockport
dam. By the way, there is confusion in
some people's minds between the locks and
the dam there. The locks are only a small
part of the dam. The flood gates of the dam
must be opened in order to relieve the great
mass of water, but only a very small portion
of the water could go through the locks, if
opened, and probably this could only be
done by wrecking the locks themselves.
If we are going to be able to carry on
living in Winnipeg with any kind of certainty, if it is to be a place where we may
feel secure in building homes for our families
and in conducting our business affairs, it will
be necessary to protect the city in some such
way as New Orleans is protected. In order
to save the city we shall have to act in a
large and comprehensive way. I am sure
that all honourable members will agree with
me when I say that we owe it to the capital
of Manitoba not to act in a niggardly manner.
After the relatively small flood of 1948
the City Engineer of Winnipeg addressed the
Engineering Institute and gave a history of
the floods that have taken place on the Red
River over the last one hundred and fifty
or one hundred and seventy-five years. The
problem is a serious one, which cannot be
cured simply by the removal of a body of
rock, at a cost of some q20 million. Levees
may have to be built to hold back the Red
River in Canada, and control measures may
have to be carried out in the United States.

In the American budget there is at the
present time an item of $15 or $20 million
for this purpose.
One must keep in mind the two diverse
qualities of the Red River: in times of drought
there is no water in it at all-I have walked
across the rivet at Emerson in a dry period
in the 30's without getting my feet muddyat other times, such as now, we have terrible
flood conditions. The Government of the
United States appropriated about $18 or $20
million to remedy drought conditions in the
Red River Valley and to provide adjacent
cities with enough water to take care of
sewage disposal during the dry season. On
the whole, I think the United States have
taken a rather sympathetic attitude towards
the Red River problem, but it is one that
demands careful investigation. I am not
sure whether it should be referred to the
International Joint Commission or to a

MAY 16, 1950
special royal commission set up for the
specific purpose. Certainly the immediate
consideration is warranted.
What about protection for the future?
True, prior to the present disaster Winnipeg
had not experienced a large flood for one
hundred and thirty years. In this connection
I am reminded of my experience of oil drilling activities. When I was in Texas investigating this question I learned that out of
some 1600 wild-cat holes only 120 developed
into producing wells. I later went to Alberta,
where I learned that out of 60 holes no producing wells were developed. So, in matters
that are highly speculative, one cannot
predict what may happen on the average
and over the years. There may be three
floods in three consecutive years or there
may be none for the next three hundred
years.
This condition is a threat to the city of
Winnipeg and the communities surrounding
it, and I appeal to honourable senators and
to the government to take a broad view of
the whole problem. Winnipeg as a city could
be written off like Galveston was and Houston took its place. But we do not want the
great city on the Red River to disappear.
We want to see proper control exercised, and
in this connection with this problem the view
taken by the government should be broad and
not picayune.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
there is little I can add to the information
given to the house by the previous speakers
on this matter. Nothing can be more devastating than nature when she exerts her
powers in one of her less lovely moods;
hurricanes, earthquakes, fire and flood have
many times caused great suffering to
humanity.
The disaster which has visited the Red
River Valley is almost beyond the imagination
of the average person. The farms and villages between Emerson on the international
border and the city of Winnipeg are seriously
flooded, and the inhabitants have scattered
to wherever they can find comfort and
shelter.

The honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Davis), who has just spoken, made
some suggestions as to how a recurrence of
such a disaster could be avoided. Not being
an engineer, I am incompetent to express an
opinion on that question, but the fact is that
although floods have recurred from time to
time, the flood this year has probably been
the worst since the settlement of this part of
Manitoba. Settlers first came to Selkirk in
1812, and in 1826 the Assiniboine River and
the Red River came down in flood and inundated the whole area that is now the City of
Winnipeg. Severe flooding conditions occurred again in 1852; the honourable leader
opposite, has referred to the flood in 1948.
Based on past experience we may expect
floods in this district from time to time, but
we hope at longer intervals. Certainly it
should not be beyond the ingenuity of man
to devise some form of protection for this
naturally rich area.
I should like to associate myself with the
honourable leader opposite in the tribute he
paid to the Red Cross Society and to the army
officials. When dikes have to be improvised
along a front of three-quarters of a mile, by
men, women and children working feverishly
filling sand bags, one has some conception
of the experience through which these people
are now passing. There is little we can do at
the moment to help the suffering, but we may
be able to protect them against a similar misfortune in the future. I hope that the federal
and provincial governments and the people of
Canada generally will extend a helping hand
to relieve the flood victims.
Before I conclude I wish to refer to the
town of Rimouski which was recently swept
by fire, and also to mention an adjoining town
which a short time afterwards suffered a
similar disaster. I understand that the conflagration in Rimouski was caused by a gale
that snapped a hydro wire -and set a
lumber yard on fire and that, fanned by the
high wind, the fire spread quickly over the
greater part of the town. I hope that the
victims of fire also will receive the earnest
sympathy and consideration of the governments concerned.

Winnipeg,
Governor of Manitoba and the Premier of
the province, all of whom expressed their
appreciation of the response of the people of
Canada to the needs of the flood victims.
I wish also to express my sincere thanks to
the authorities in the United States, who have
taken a keen interest in the recent flood,
not only as it affects their own country but
also as it affects the province of Manitoba. I
understand that a million sand bags were
flown to Winnipeg by the American Air Force,
and that Mr. Johnston, the Secretary of War
for the United States, sent a telegram to the
Honourable Mr. Claxton offering full co-operation.
I admit that Winnipeg's predicament is
serious, but let me speak for the country
people among whom I dwell. I recall that, in
1893, when I was a boy, we had a bad flood,
but the damage was not too extensive because
the water did not lie on the land for very
long. The flood of 1897 was worse because of
severe

weather. In that year the water remainiedI
on the land for about four weeks, and thiere
was no harvest. In the flood of 1916 the
land was inundated for only a short time,
and a harvest was possible. But this year,
it is a different story. Already it is May 16,
and only within the last twenty-four hours
has the water receded an inch or two from
its awful peak, and there is no possibility of
it disappearing fast enough to allow the soi
to dry sufficiently for the seeiing of even one
acre of land. J am positive about this.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are right.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The damage to farm
lands has reached alarning proportions, and
the loss to livestock is tremendous. Many
of the farmers in this dairy-producing valley
have had to sell or destroy much of their
stock because they have no feed or shelter

Mr. Lambert:

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend

every year we harvest about 200,000 bushels,
which are processed in Fort Garry.
Again I want to thank the people of Canada
and the United States for the sympathy they
have expressed in their messages of good will.

entitled to.
In conclusion I may say that I hope our
municipal and provincial authorities will cooperate with the Canadian and American
governments in formulating some scheme to
prevent these floods in the future.
Some

Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. J. A. MacKinnon: Honourable senators,
as a member of the government I am not
just sure what, if anything, I should say at
this time. 1 have listened carefully to the
remarks of the various senators, and if I
correctly remember the representations of the
honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson), I can assure him that the
government is seriously and earnestly considering every item he mentioned. Members of
the goverrment have visited Winnipeg with
their departmental experts, and an accumulation of information is being placed in the
hands of the government, and an announcement based on this information will be made
almost immediately by the appropriate minister.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Joseph Adelard Godbout: Honourable
senators, before speaking on this motion may
I first thank the members of this honourable
house for the sympathy they have shown to
the people of Rimouski, which is in my
part of the country. I received my education
in Rimouski and lived there for a number
of years, and I know that everyone there
feels most thankful for the expressions of
sympathy they have received from all across
Canada. On behalf of the people of Rimouski
I want to thank Canadians generally for
offering to help rebuild the town The inhabitants of Rimouski are showing splendid
courage, and I think by next winter the town
will be almost entirely rebuilt.
I want to assure the honourable senators
from Manitoba that their people have the
sympathy of all Canadians, particularly those
of the province of Quebec. The Manitoba
flood disaster is not an ordinary event and
could not be foreseen. It is the responsibility
of the Canadian Government and of all Canadians not only to help in meeting the present
emergency in Manitoba, but to do something
to prevent similar disasters in the future. The
government may rest assured that in meeting its responsibilities in this matter it will
have the support of everyone in Canada.

MAY 16, 1950

Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators,
the object of my asking for leave to make

The motion was withdrawn.

CONCURRENCE IN COMMONS AMENDMENTS
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the House of Commons to Bill B, an Act respecting Grants of

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
the amendments made by the other place to
this bill are of a very minor character. They
really only change two words and insert one
sentence, for clarification of what was there
before. I feel that we could probably concur
in these amendments now, unless any honourable senator wishes to have the bill sent back
to the standing committee which considered
it in the first place.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The amendments are all
right.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Unless any honourable
senator holds a contrary view, I would move

CONVENTION OF NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, May 9,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Euler:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by the United States of America of a Convention of delegates from the democracies which
sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty and representing the principal political parties of such democracles, for the purpose of exploring how far their
peoples and the peoples of such other democracies
as the Convention may invite to send delegates,
can apply among them within the framework of the
United Nations, the principles of federal union.

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, the
motion moved the other day by the honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) is one that should receive our most
earnest consideration. I am quite sure that
there is no one in this honourable house who
is not concerned about the general international situation. The motion presents an
idea that is not new, that has been under
considerable discussion in the United States
and has also been the subject of much discussion and comment in the Western European countries. It is simply a declaration
that, because of the situation in which the
world is today, the western powers, the
freedom-loving powers of the world, should
co-ordinate their work, improve their relaTERRITORIAL LANDS BILL

bombs could be dropped on defenceless cities.

SENATE

We then had no tanks, no motive power based
upon oil. When horses and mules furnished
the only power for the transport of guns and
materials, war was of necessity limited in
its scope.
Another aspect of this problem that has
struck me very forcibly is the increasing
brutality of war. Have we slipped downhill
in our concept of civilization? It is true that
wars were waged hundreds of years ago, but
the people who participated in them exhibited
much greater chivalry and far more care for
defenceless people than we witnessed in the
last war.
War has a disintegrating effect upon not
only the economy of the various countries
engaged in it, and indeed of the whole wide
world, but upon people everywhere. It is
degrading and demoralizing, and nothing is
more harmful to the human spirit or mankind's aspirations for a better world. Therefore, if civilization is to be saved, there is not
much time to lose. The sands are running
out, and unless among the nations which love
peace some bold, imaginative, constructive
effort can be made to preserve it for the
future, I think we are in a very bad way
indeed.
Another fact -about modern war is that none
can escape it. During the recent war not one
bomb was dropped on Canada or the United
States, and no shot was fired by an enemy
within our borders.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What about the flying
saucers?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In those circumstances one
would expect that we would largely escape
the consequen ces of war. But while we did
not suffer physical destruction, none can
gainsay the fact that the war had its effect
upon mankind and the economy of all
countries, ours with the others, and has left
problems that will not be solved within' a
generation.
What would be the nature of the conflict
if, unhappily, we got into another war? It
is a safe assumption that in its power of
destruction and damage it would be as far in
advance of the Second World War as that
war was in advance of what we call the
Great War. The conflict, if unhappily it
should come, would be intensified by reason
of the character of the struggle, which would
not only be a conflict of arms but of ideas.
Throughout the world today there is a conflict between two concepts of life; on the
one side is arrayed everything that dignifies
the human personality, and over against it
stands everything that degrades human life
and personality.

There can be little doubt that during the
past year Russia has scored in the international game of diplomatic politics. We
have seen China, with her 450 million people,
come under the influence of Russia. I know
there were those who hoped that China might
not become a satellite -of greater Rus-sia, but
every important communist leader in China
today has been trained in Moscow. Though
the resources of China are great, she has
for the most part a peasant population. Above
all other things she needs industrial equipment and capital to develop ber resources.
The only possible source from which she could
get help would be the western powers; but
they cannot grant aid to her so long as conditions permit such aid to strengthen the combination against the free and democratic way
of life.
Moreover, it is not without significance
that Russia is strongly entrenched in
Manchuria, one of the richest provinces in
China, and has control of several of the
important northern ports of China. To me
it seems a safe assimption that Russia will
not take a chance in China and suffer a
repetition of ber experience in Yugoslavia.
In considering China's position today we
must also be aware of the communist infiltration into all the other far eastern
countries. Russia and China have an infinite
capacity to make trouble for the new
Indonesian Republic in the far Pacifie, for
Indo-China-where some of the people are
today causing trouble to France-and for the
Malayan states. The power to stir up trouble
is now being exercised, and this will continue
for many months, perhaps for years. When
we look at the European side of the picture
it is clear that Russia has under her influence
such countries as Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria. Tito is
in the no man's land. The power of Russia
is being relentlessly exercised upon these
countries in order to propagate ber materialistic imperialism.
Communism is a philosophy with which one
may differ as a basis of understanding, but
communism in Russia today is stark imperialism to an extreme degree, with much greater
power and danger behind it than ever existed
under the autocratic czars of the past.
There are those who hope that Russia may
collapse internally. That may happen some
day, but she is now a dictatorship whose
agencies influence the human mind and spirit
towards the one clear end of maintaining the
power of the autocracy of Russia.

MAY 16, 1950

I read the other day a statement which
appeared to have a good deal of force to it.
it was this:
Men and government are mortal, but the spirit of
liberty and freedom is immortal.

As past experience has shown, freedom and
liberty sooner or later assert themselves.
The time for that to happen is probably far
distant so far as Russia is concernied, and
for years we will have to meet the threat
of Russia as it exists at the present time.
There can be no doubt that she has great
resources and that they are being mobilized
and organized today to face the contingency
of a world war.

having their troubles too because of the
natural difficulty of meeting each other's
views.
It is against this world, background that we
musit consider the motion of our honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). His
motion seeks to have the Senate approve the
calling by the United States of a conference of
the representatives of the freedom-loving
nations-the western powers, including the
British Commonwealth of Nations, and the
representatives of such other countries as
would wish to attend. The aim of the conference would be to concert their interests, so
as to enable them to work together more
harmoniously in the future. That of course
would constitute a wide union, bringing
together approximately 300,000,000 peoples of
countries having the same ideals. There are
many outstanding similarities between Holland, Belgium, France, Italy, the United
States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and other such countries. They have
the same traditions of freedom and liberty and
similar forms of democratic and parliamentary government. It is true that they have
had economic differences in the past, but these
have never affected their fundamental characteristics.
There has been no more hopeful sign lately
than the announcement a few days ago of the
rapprochement between France and Germany.
Germany should by all means be a member of
this western union.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I repeat that nothing has
been more encouraging than the possibility
of a better understanding between France and
Germany, because during the last hundred
years the differences between these two
countries have done more than anything else
to upset world peace.

I am not blind to the fact that many

country likes to give up its sovereignty; but
within the past week France has proposed to
Germany that they integrate their great
resources of iron and coal. I think it is unfortunate that at the moment Britain appears to
be hesitant about supporting this idea. I can
well understand the reasons, but they are
negligible when compared to the cost of
maintaining peace.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I hope that Canada will
make it clearly understood that she believes

respect we should stand with the United
States. This co-operation between France
and Germany is simply one step forward to
the achievement of the purposes outlined in
this motion, but other steps have been made
towards a European union. The Western
Pact was brought into existence to defend
Western Europe against possible enemies from
the East. We are a party to it. There should
be reduction or abolition of tariffs and barriers to trade as between the western European countries and Canada and the United
States should participate. There may be good
reasons for such countries as India, Pakistan
and Ceylon remaining out of a western union;
but if the countries I have mentioned can
come together and work more co-operatively
in a clear and firm understanding, it is
unquestionable that nothing but great good
for world peace will result.
To co-operate more effectively these countries will have to surrender some of their
national sovereignties. As my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) said
the other day, a precedent was given us when
our provinces federated in 1867 to form the
Dominion of Canada. There was not a single
province that did not sacrifice something of
its individual sovereignty; and when the
United States federated well over 150 years
ago, every single state sacrificed some part of
its sovereignty. National sovereignty is a
fine catch-phrase, but it should not be allowed
to stand in the way of the progress of mankind.
Honourable senators, I think a federal
union of this kind would mean a free movement of people, capital and goods. It would
bring about the same sort of conditions as
exist on this continent between Canada and
her provinces and between the various states
of the American Union. I do not wish to
make a sordid appeal, but certainly Canada's

SENATE
urgent need today is for more markets, and a
scheme of this kind, if it can be brought about,
would certainly help to create these markets.
Such a union would mean even more than
a free movement of people, goods and capital;
it would mean a unified foreign policy. Is
there anyone in his senses-apart from the
enslaved masses of Russia and her satelliteswho believes for a moment that Britain,
France, the United States, or Canada, or the
other nations who would be associated with
them, have imperialistic designs on any other
country of the world? Those days have gone.
Consequently the unified foreign policy of
a western union of nations would be directed
wholly to the maintenance of peace. Further,
it would be directed to the development
of backward countries. As this great agency
expanded-strengthened by the moderation
of its polilcies and ýthe saneness of its administration-it would attract, as a magnet
attracts iron, support from other less favoured
nations.
I add one other point. A combination of
this kind would stand first and foremost for
freedom and liberty. There is no greater
danger today to the world than that as the
years pass the old concepts of the freedom of
the individual under the law and his right
to a say in how he is to be governed, will
slip away from us. Herein lies the great
distinction between what may be called the
Russian systen and the heritage of freedom which was won for us by hard battles in
the past. Liberty has not been always secure.
For a certain period a measure of freedom
prevailed in the Greek city states; but it
disappeared. Imperial Rome, though based
utpon a different system from our own,
achieved a great measure of freedom, and
gave western nations the foundation of their
present law. But Rome, too, passed away.
Why? Those who read history know that as
Rome became prosperous she grew weak; she
tried by bribes to obtain support from her
own people and from others. Finally, Roman
power was destroyed, and the world experienced the thousand years of the Dark Ages.
We do not want that cycle to be repeated.
Do not those countries that put emphasis
on human personality and ordered freedomthe right of the individual to lead his life
with none to make him afraid, secure in life
and person-possess great and lofty ideals
which are worthy of adoption by the world at
large? And how can those principles be
developed more effectively than through

western union? If this happy prospect can
be realized, we should be assured of at least
a hundred years of peace. For it is significant
that those powers which are most advanced
in the arts of government and of education,
and which reverence the Christian faith, are
those that have made the greatest progress
in the arts and sciences and in industrial
production. They have attained this position through the workings of the spirit of
freedom; and they possess within themselves
the power, if any should challenge them, of
meeting that challenge effectively. That is
why I am convinced that through their
agency the world may look forward to at least
a century of peaceful development; and
under such auspices -a United Nations organization may be built which, growing in
strength as the decades pass, may receive
universal recognition in much the same way
as today, in our individual capacities, we
recognize our respective governments.
These are great ideals. It may be that my
honourable friend from Waterloo has aimed
too high. I do not think so. The qualities of
honesty and decency and truth which we
honour in our friends, and which may be collectively spoken of as character, must be
made to prevail among all nations. The
agency which is commended in this resolution would be, I am convinced, effective in
bringing about that result. And if in this
aim we were successful, as the chances are
we would be, we might look forward with
confidence to the prediction of one of the
greatest of the Old Testament prophets. If
any of my honourable colleagues are unfamiliar with the Book of Isaiah, I recommend
them to read it occasionally. In conditions
not greatly dissimilar to those of today,
Isaiah looked forward to the time when the
peoplesshall beat their swords into plowshares, and their
spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.

By passing this resolution-and I hope
it will have the unanimous approval of the
house-we, at any rate in this part of Parliament, will be registering our approval of one
of the grandest conceptions ever to emerge
in the whole history of our people.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senatorsý, this is a
comparatively simple bill, having to do with
the Railway Grade Crossing Fund set up
under the Railway Act and administered by
the Board of Transport Commissioners to
make contributions to public protection at
railway crossings. Every year since 1909,
except during the war period from 1939 to
1947, some amount has been voted by parliament under this Act towards the cost of
eliminating or protecting railway grade
crossings. At the present time the legislation
provides substantially as follows. First of
all there is an annual vote of $500,000, which,
as I say, is administered by the Board of
Transport Commissioners. Secondly, the total
contribution out of this fund to the cost of
any single project for protection cannot
exceed 40 per cent of the total cost. And
thirdly, the total contribution out of this
fund in respect of any one project must not
exceed $100,000.
The bill now before us proposes to effect
two changes. In the first place, it proposes to
increase for the next six years the annual
vote to this fund from $500,000 to $1 million.
And secondly, while it retains the limitation
that no more than 40 per cent of the total
cost of any project may be paid out of this
fund, the total contribution which may be
made toward the cost of any one project is
increased from $100,000 to $150,000.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Who pays the other 60
per cent?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The municipalities or
the provinces concerned. I speak subject to
correction, but I understand that the distribution of cost is, as a rule, decided by the
Board of Transport Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What amount is in the
fund at the present time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Again speaking, subject to correction, I understand that there is
approximately $300,000 or $400,000 in the
fund at present.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is it cumulative? For
instance, if at the end of any one year there
is a balance, will that be supplemented by an
additional $500,000, or is the amount in the
fund limited to a total of $500,000?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: An annual payment
is made into the fund.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Of $500,000?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: At the moment it is
$500,000, and it has been that amount since
1948.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps my honourable
friend does not understand my question.

Suppose there was a balance from last year
of $200,000, would the payment this year be
$500,000, or only $300,000?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: There is a fixed annual
contribution of $500,000.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Whether it is expended
or not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Whether it is expended
or not.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the deputy
leader whether the railways contribute as
much as the dominion, the provinces and the
municipalities?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think that is the case.
The fund is within the jurisdiction of the
Board of Transport Commissioners and is
administered by the board. As my honourable friend knows, in the case of a grade
separation, the Board of Transport Commissioners makes an order directing that so
much shall be paid by the railway, so much
by the province and so much by the municipality; and a proportion which is limited
by this legislation comes out of the Railway
Grade Crossing Fund.
lonourable senators may be interested to
know that since the year 1909, when this
fund was first instituted, $12,098,000 have
been expended out of the fund for grade
separation construction. Perhaps I should
add that of this $12 million odd, the province
of Ontario has received a little more than
half.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is reasonable.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Can the deputy leader
give us the number of crossings which have
been dealt with up to the present time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have not the figure
before me, but if the house wishes to have
the bill go to the appropriate committee, I
am quite sure the information can be
obtained.
There is one further set of figures with
which I should perhaps burden the house.
The sums which have actually been paid out
of the fund over the past four years are, in
round figures, as follows:
1946-47 .....................
$227,000
1947-48 .....................
250,000
1948-49 .....................
293,000
1949-50 .....................
581,000
Hon. Mr. Reid: Do I understand that the
bill will be referred to a committee? In spite
of the large sums of money that are being
spent for protection of railway crossings,
there is still an annual increase in the number of fatal accidents at railway crossings.

MAY 17, 1950
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am entirely in the
hands of the house in the matter of referring
the bill to a committee. In view of the
remarks of the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) and the question
asked by the honourable senator from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn), I think the bill should
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications, where officials could be available to answer any questions that honourable senators may wish
to ask.
As to the observation of the honourable
senator from New Westminster, it is unfortunately true that railway crossing casualties
are constantly increasing. However, I think
that is attributable to increased automobile
traffic and the greater tendency of our population to travel, and that no matter how many
hundreds of millions of dollars we might
spend for the purpose of protection there
would still be a substantial increase in railway-crossing accidents.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I raise the point because
I do not think a contribution from the fund
of 40 per cent is sufficient to induce action
by the municipalities who cannot afford to
meet their portion of the cost of eliminating
crossings.

Hon. Mr. McKeen: The train has the rightof-way.
The motion was agreed to and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: I should like to ask the
deputy leader if he has any figures on the
average amount expended for the various
grade crossings.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That will come out when
the bill is -considered in committee.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: I am referring to the
average contribution by the dominion, the
province and the municipality.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know that any
figures could be produced in exactly that
form, but when the bill is before the committee evidence can be called to show the
average division of cost between the various
interested parties.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: That is satisfactory.
The motion was agreed to.

is interesting to hear this subject discussed,
but I am always amazed at the number of
accidents that take place at well-protected
crossings. One rarely hears of an accident
at a point where the railway runs through a
cut, or for other reasons would seem to be
dangerous. One often hears of a motorist
driving right into the side of a train. In my
opinion something should be done to teach
the public to exercise greater care, and to
travel more slowly.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I quite agree with my
honourable friend from Blaine Lake. I recently read some figures-I do not recall them
now-which showed that as many grade

Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
last week it was our privilege to listen to
the interesting and illuminating remarks of
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), when he introduced the motion,
which is now before us, advocating the principle of an Atlantic union. Yesterday the
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) seconded this resolution with his customary
eloquence.
It is indeed a great privilege for me to associate myself with the two distinguished members of this house who have already advocated
the extension of federalism to wider areas in

SENATE
the world, and to give due credit to those who
on iprevious occasions have discussed this
subject.
During the course of last session the senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) and the
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
referred to the federalist tendencies which are
manifested by various groups in a good many
countries of the old world as well as in
America. Recently, during the debate on the
Speech from the Throne, our very eloquent
colleague from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) discussed the question of world federalism.
There is now before us a motion, which I am
glad to support, for the study of the possibilities of forming a North Atlantic union
within the framework of the United Nations.
I wish to congratulate sincerely the members of this house who have taken the
initiative in bringing this very important
subject to our attention: in doing so they
have rendered a great service to the sacred
cause of peace.
The dark clouds of another world war have
been hanging over mankind for a couple of
years. In fact, there bas been actual warfare
in Greece since the end of 1944, and hostilities
are going on continuously or intermittently
in China, Malaya, Indo-China, and Indonesia.
Also, Palestine, Turkey. and Trieste are areas
of dispute. A spark in any of these dangerspots would be enough to start a conflagration
which nothing could stop.
How far we are from the hopes which were
so generally entertained when the United
Nations organization was formed in June
1945? That memorable birthday was saluted
as the dawn of a new era in the history of
mankind, as the beginning of a world system
of law and order which would preserve
future generations from the scourge of war.
Within the framework of the United Nations
Canada bas tried honestly and sincerely to
re-establish peace and to promote friendly
relations among all the peoples of the earth.
But the situation, in my opinion, is deteriorating from month to month. With the boycott
by the U.S.S.R. of the Chinese Nationalist
delegates at Lake Success, a tragic deadlock
now paralyses almost completely the working
of the expensive and complicated machinery
which was devised and set up at San Francisco five years ago. Some other means must
be adopted without further delay, within the
framework of the United Nations, if possible.
To quote a sentence already historic, we must
either "unite or perish". A federal union,
binding together as many peace-loving states
as possible, is the solution advocated by such
outstanding statesmen, thinkers and jurists as
-to name only a few-Churchill, Maritain,
Sir Norman Angell and Scelle.

To illustrate this point, honourable senators,
may I quote the following extract, which I
have translated from the Course on Public
InternationalLaw of George Scelle, page 254:
In the eventual expansion of federalism, we must
consider as normal a superposition of federal stratifications growing always wider and ending finally in
a world organization of the community of nations.
Such a realization may remain difficult, but the
achievement of regional or continental systems of
federalism is much less difficult than some may
think. The establishment of a European federal
union after the war is desirable, if not even likely,
and we must join our efforts with those of other
governments in order to secure such a union.

These lines were written during the last
world war by the great French jurist who is
Chairman of the United Nations Commission
for the Codification of International Law.
This quotation may be supplemented by a
reference to an excellent article published by
Mr. Roger Chaput in the April number of
L'Action Universitaire. With this author, let
us recall the publication a few years ago of
"Union Now" by Clarence Streit. At that
time this eminent federalist was advocating
the federation of the English-speaking world;
he is now the leader in the United States of
the campaign for Atlantic union. In the
United States also we find the movement
known as United World Federalism, which is
supported by some 34,000 people.
In Europe a great many groups are working
for the federation of Western Europe. On the
government level we find the European Council, which was created at Strasbourg in 1949
and already has had several meetings. One is
scheduled to take place in London during the
present month.
Many organizations are working for the
Thus, the
adoption of world federalism.
World Movement for World Federal Government was founded at Montreux in 1947. This
important group held a conference in Stockholm last year, and another such meeting is
being organized to be held in Rome in January, 1951. In April last a very interesting
meeting took place in Namur, Belgium, thanks
to the initiative of the founder of Pro Pace,
Mr. Louis Enpain, and of Mr. Henri Koch,
President of the Institut Luxembourgeois Universitaire. Neither can I pass in silence the
name of Lord Boyd Orr, the last winner of the
Nobel Prize, as the great champion of world
government.
Honourable senators are already acquainted
with the idea of a world government. It may
seem but an idle dream, particularly since
mankind is now apparently divided into two
hostile camps. Because of the relative failure
of the United Nations, one may be tempted to
doubt the possibility of ever organizing the
United States of the World. Yet, for those
of us who believe in the Divine Fatherhood

MAY 17, 1950
of the Creator and in the consequent brotherhood of all men, the conviction always survives in our hearts that there must exist a universal community of nations, an international
organism wide enough to embrace all civilized
peoples.
May I remark here that the United Nations
Organization, ta my great regret, was not
originally designed to be such a universal
organism. The agreement known as the
San Francisco Charter is not even open ta
all states. Membership is restricted ta the
so-called peace-loving states, and the admission of new members is subject ta the
recommendation of the Security Council. In
other words, any state may be blackballed
through the exercise of the veto by one of
the five great powers. May I add that by a
strange contradiction the principle of the
sovereign equality of al states was solemnly
proclaimed at San Francisco. In fact, the
great powers have so jealously preserved
their individual sovereignty that they have
secured the exorbitant privilege known as the
veto or rule of unanimity. The great powers
have thus refused to be bound by the decision
of any majority of states or of any authority
whatever. In other words, the rule of law
seems ta be good enough for small or middle
states, but each great power has chosen ta
remain above the law of nations.
Even had it nat been systematically abused,
the so-called right of veto is, in my opinion,
contrary ta the existence of any real community of nations. No association can survive
unless all its members are governed by a
definite set of rules applicable ta each and
all. No one can be above the law in any
given society, because the supremacy of law
is essential ta the existence of any society.
Therefore, no world government can ever
exist unless every state, whether large or
small, whether strong or weak, transfers a
part of its sovereignty ta some supra-national
authority. No regional or continental system
of federalism is possible unless, as my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
said yesterday, a definite group of states
delegate ta a central parliament or council
sufficient powers ta promote common welfare
and ta preserve security.
Will it be possible some day ta transform
the United Nations into the United States of
the World? If this can ever be done, the
structure erected at San Francisco would
offer the easiest means ta achieve a system
of world government. But those who favour
the extension of federalism do not agree
among themselves concerning the geographical
region which should first be federalizedwhether it should be the whole world at once
or just certain parts of it. Many believe-and

I am one of those-that the spirit of cooperation which existed among nations in
1945 has considerably decreased. Fundamental conflicts of ideologies and interests
now separate the West and the East. It
would seem that for a long time ta come there
can be no hope of reuniting into one world
those opposite blocks.
The only task which we can now achieve
appears to be the piecemeal organization into
federal unions of certain continents or certain
regions. Such regional federations at a later
date may pave the way ta some larger system
of federalism, and this may eventually lead
ta the foundation of the'United States of the
World. In the meanwhile, some kind of
federation of Western Europe is certainly a
possibility; but strange as this may sound, it
may be even easier ta federalize a larger unit
such as the Atlantic Union. Europe has been
tragically divided by centuries of war.
Some leading statesmen, such as Churchill
in Great Britain, Bidault and Schumann in
France, Spaak in Belgium and Adenauer in
Germany, have favoured the creation of a
Western Union. But I am convinced that the
union of the twelve countries now bound by
the Atlantic Pact would offer much greater
advantages. I believe that within such a
larger federation each country would have a
much better chance ta survive. Let us take,
for instance, the offer made in 1940 by
Churchill ta politically unite France with
Great Britain. That offer was refused because
Great Britain, which would have been the
stronger partner, would have dominated. An
economic union of our country with the
United States would mean our absorption by
our great neighbour ta the South. But If
Canada becomes one of the twelve members
of the Atlantic Union, we know that we can
rely, for instance, on the support of Great
Britain and France. It would thus be possible
ta offset the disproportion which exists
between ourselves and the great country to
the South.
The very interesting motion now before us
merely calls for the study of the broad general principle of a federal union. We are not
obliged ta discuss now the ways and means
which should be adopted ta realize such a
union or federation. In other words, we are
not obliged ta take sides either with the
"federalists" or "unionists." But I wish ta
indicate briefly the differences which separate
those two schools of thought.
The "federalists" favour the immediate
adoption of a constitution creating at once a
political unit, which I call the United States
of the North Atlantic. The "unionists", on
the contrary, want ta use existing international organisms ta enlarge their activities

SENATE
and to strengthen their authority over their
members. Thus, after the suggestion first made
by our Prime Minister and by our own Mr.
Pearson, Mr. Bidault expressed the opinion
that economie and social co-operation should
be efficiently promoted under the terms of the
Atlantic Pact. This question of an economic
union is now under discussion in London.
Personally, I am convinced that the only
practical steps which can be taken at first consist precisely in such an extension of the
Atlantic Pact for constructive purposes into
economic and social activities. It is with great
hopes and with a deep emotion that I salute
the dawn of such a "Grand Union". I know
of no better plan for the maintenance of
peace, for the preservation of our own security
and for the promotion of the welfare of all
those concerned. I am convinced that in this
new and gigantic task Canada will play a
worthy part, and that we shall be faithful to
our traditional policy of co-operation and good
neighbourliness: Peace on earth to all men
of good will.
Yes, peace on earth! But what is peace? It
has been defined as tranquillity and order. It
may be compared to the quiet beauty of a
starlit night. Under the title Starlit Night the
great Spanish author Fray Luis de Leon has
given us an immortal description of peace,
which I shall try to sum up by way of conclusion. I't is as follows. Even if reason did not
prove to us how much peace deserves to be
cherished, the contemplation of a beautiful
sky on a clear night would furnish a sufficient
testimony in favour of peace. Indeed, is it not
a perfect image of peace-that harmonious
spectacle which is thus given to us from
abov? Peace, according to St. Augustine, is
quiet order, or a condition of tranquillity and
stability required by good order, which is
precisely what is shown to us by a starlit
night. And Fray Luis de Leon then describes
the legions of stars which shine most beautifully, standing in order, as if in well-formed
ranks. Each star keeps unfailingly its own

place. None encroaches on the space of its
neighbouring star, none troubles another in its
function; no star ever forgets its duty or
breaks the eternal and holy law which was
given by Providence. The stars show fraternal
love to each other, and the greater stars give
something of their light to the lesser stars.
In a certain way the stars display mutual respect; all together, they temper their rays
and their strength, bringing them down to a
peaceful unity of virtue, made up of various
parts and aspects in a unity complete and
powerful above all words.
Honourable senators, that ideal condition of
tranquillity and stability which is peace is
admirably illustrated in the Spanish masterpiece which I have so imperfectly translated.
By that classical description of a starlit night,
let us be reminded that it is only through the
principle of federal union that the various
states, big or small, can keep their respective
places like the stars, never encroaching on a
neighbour's vital space, never breaking the
eternal and holy law of Divine justice. I am
convinced that through the application of
federalism all the nations of the earth may
show not only mutual respect to each other,
but even a truc spirit of brotherhood. Like
the greater stars which give something of
their light to the lesser stars in order to
achieve unity, may all the big powers, before
it becomes too late, give up a part of their sovereignty in order to achieve on this earth the
peaceful unity, complete and powerful above
ail words, which God has given us the privilege of contemplating silently and religiously
in the sublime quietness of one of our clear
Canadian nights, when all the stars proclaim:
Glory to God in the highest, and peace on
carth to men of good will.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Could my honourable

It will be noted that the other sections relating to sales tax are now in force, having
been made effective when the budget was

Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Would the honourable

receive aid frorn the Dominion Government
and the provinces, are not included in the
exemptions?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I had noted the omission

line somewhere. If there should happen to
be any institutions, supported by municipalities, but not in receipt of federal or provincial

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

immediately to Committee of the Whole. at
this sitting.
The purpose of the bill is to clarify some
sections of the Customs Act, and to delete
others which are no longer applicable, in
that they have been incorporated in other
enactments, or superseded.
Section 2 provides for the repeal of provisions which have been varied from time
to time as new trade agreements were made.
For instance, it repeals subsection (3) of
section 43 of the Customs Act, which was
inserted in 1936 as a result of trade agreements made in 1935 between Canada, the
United States and Japan. This subsection, in
effect, provided an appeal to the tariff board
upon values fixed by the minister upder
section 43 of the Act. The minister, in
taking action to fix the value of goods imported into Canada under such conditions
as prejudicially or injuriously affect the
interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers, does so under the authorization of
the Governor-in-Council, and it is felt that
the government must remain responsible for
action taken under this section.
Under the terms of the Geneva trade
agreement, Canada is now precluded from
applying, under section 43, arbitrary valuations against signatory countries. That means
the majority of the trading countries, there
being but sixteen exceptions. Section 43A of
the Act was introduced in 1937 merely to
ratify and confirm valuations established
under section 43 prior to that time. The
government now takes full responsibility for
valuations made of gQods from non-signatory
countries which may be produced under conditions deemed to be prejudicial to Canadian
industry.
The main feature of section 3 of the bill

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators I
am pleased that we will have the opportunity
of considering these pipe line bills in committee. I may say that I prefer our procedure
to that of another place. When the bills are
considered in committee we can ask questions

either pass them or reject them. By dealing

tô $134,796,720, and goods admitted free, to
$164,715,480. The value of the imports to
which the 10 per cent discount applied was
only $3,120,004, and the list of them includes
such articles as milk foods, cereal foods,
metal parts, cotton clothing and mixed textiles.
By section 2 of the Bill, the Minister of
National Revenue is authorized to fix the
period when imported fresh fruits and
vegetables are to be made subject to the
specific rates of duty provided for in the items
relating to these ,products. These rates may
also be fixed on a regional basis. For instance,
the minister can provide specific rates for
the Maritime Provinces, for British Columbia,
or for other areas, in the light of the quantity
of importations and the months in which
they arrive. It is also proposed to exempt
from the specific duty fresh fruits and
vegetables that have been purchased and are
in transit at the time of the issue of the
order. If some importer for instance has
ordered a carload of fresh fruits and vegetables which are on their way to Canada
when an order imposing the duty is made
by the minister, this consignment is exempt
from the application of the rate.
The changes give effect to the undertaking
entered into by Canada at Geneva in 1947 as
regards the tariff on fresh fruits and
vegetables.
It may be of interest at this point to mention that Canada bas been represented at two
conferences: one at Geneva in 1947, attended
by the representatives
of twenty-three
countries and one in 1949 at Annecy, in
France, near the Swiss frontier, at which
the delegates of nine other countries-a
total of thirty-two-were in attendance. The
next conference will be held at Torquay,
England, this year, when the whole matter of
tariffs as between various countries of the
world will be discussed.
Section 3 deals with the provision contained in section 16, subsection 3 of the Act,
which authorized the imposition of an
additional duty of 10 per cent ad valorem
on imported goods not marked to indicate
the country of origin. Hitherto, upon the
arrival of unmarked goods, the customs
official could apply this additional duty of 10
per cent. This was felt to be an injustice,
and the subsection which enacted it is being
repealed.
Under the amending section the goods
in future will be held without penalty until
marked, but the 10 per cent ad valorem duty
has been removed, as it bas been considered
a restraint of trade.
Honourable senators will find three schedules in the bill. Section 4 deals with the

twenty-two items appearing in Schedule A.
This schedule contains such items as 206a
and 558d, the wording of which has been
amended in order to eliminate obsolete
phraseology. Other amendments in Schedule
A affect the tariff on such items as dates
for packaging, compounds for the manufacture
of phonographic records, and maps and
posters for educational purposes. Item 705a,
settlers effects, is also amended. Heretofore
a settler's motor car, if valued at $1,000 or
less, was exempt from duty. The amount of
the exemption has now been increased to
$1,500.
Trousseaux and wedding presents
are now included in the free list under item
705.
Section 5 deals with 435 items which appear
in two categories in Schedule B. The rates
on 81 items are the same as they have been
for the past ten years; on the other 354 items
the rates have been in effect since January,
1948. On some items in this schedule the
wording in the tariff differs slightly from the
wording in the existing Customs Tariff; other
items have been divided into two or more
sub-items by the various trade agreements.
It was deemed necessary to re-arrange and
re-number many of these items and in some
cases to re-word them. When the new
Customs Tariff Bill is printed it will show on
one document the rates in effect. It is worth
while to note that the tariff classification of
item 254(4), mixed gums, is reduced from
10 per cent to free.
An item which will interest honourable
senators is tin plate, on which the British
tariff is increased from free to 15 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What item is that?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Item 383(b). Honourable
senators will recall that it was the aim of the
countries represented at the 1947 trade negotiations at Geneva to reduce the general level
of tariffs and to eliminate tariff preferences on
a mutually advantageous basis. Towards the
end of these negotiations the United States
requested the United Kingdom to give up the
tariff preference it enjoyed in Canada on tin
plate. The United Kingdom agreed, and received tariff concessions from the United
States in compensation for giving up this
preference. In other words, at the request of
Great Britain, and really as a concession to
the United States, we pla.ced a tariff on tin
plate from Britain which formerly entered
free. From now on there will be a 15 per
cent duty.
Hon. Mr. Doone: What item is that?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Item 383(b). In order to
facilitate the successful conclusion of the trade
negotiations between Canada, the United
Kingdom and the United States, Canada agreed

MAY 2Z, 1950
to the proposal that the British preferential
tariff on tin plate be increased to 15 per cent,
which is the same as the most-favourednation rate. This had the effect of eliminating the preference. It was undertsood on all
sides that when this change was made it
would not be of much practical importance in
the trade between Canada and the United
Kingdom. In the first place, the United
Kingdom in the post-war period did not
expect to be in a position for many years to
export significant quantities of tin plate to
Canada. In the second place Canadian production had expanded to the point where we
could supply a large part of our own tin plate
requirements. Our present production of tin
plate is worth in the neighbourhood of $35
million annually, which is a great increase
over the relatively srnall pre-war production.
In 1947 our imports of tin plate from all
countries were valued at over $8 million. Of
this amount $107,000 worth came from the
United Kingdom and the remainder from the
United States. Our production of tin was
steadily increasing, and in 1949 the value of
imports from all countries dropped to
$3,800,000, all of which came from the United
States except $68,000 worth which came from
the United Kingdom. Honourable senators
will realize therefore that the amount of trade
with the United Kingdom affected by this item
is very small. The present indication is that
increased Canadian production will cause our
imports to dwindle still further.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Would my honourable
friend inform the house where tin plate is
made in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I understand it is made by
two firms in Hamilton, Ontario. Honourable
senators, as to Schedule CHon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me to ask him a question
before he proceeds to deal with Schedule C?
If I am not mistaken, heretofore the duty on
textile goods, cotton goods, has been 25 per
cent or, on goods subject to the British preference, 10 per cent, and this bill proposes to
eliminate the British preference.
Hon. Mr. Reid: So far as I am aware, the
bill does not do that. Perhaps my honourable
friend's question could be better answered by
the appropriate officials when the bill is in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Vien: My attention has been
drawn to a provision in the bill which would
have the effect of removing the British preference of 10 per cent on cotton goods. I have
been told that after June 1, if this bill passes,
the duty applicable to British, as well as to
American goods, will be 25 per cent. The
complaint is that business people have made

definite commitrents and sold at firm prices,
and that the notice of the increase in duty as
of June 1 was too short to permit these people
to deliver goods under existing contracts.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am unable to give my
honourable friend a definite answer, but I am
informed that cotton goods have not been
specifically changed in the schedule.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I think you will find cotton
goods mentioned in items 523b and 5231 of
Schedule B, on page 28 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My information is that the
change mentianed by the honourable gentleman is not being made in the tariff schedule.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I draw the matter to my
honourable friend's attention so that he may
have definite information for us in committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I shall be pleased to make
a note of it, and no doubt a specific answer
will be given in committee.
Another change in Schedule B has to do
with valuable drums or large containers in
which Canadian-made goods are shipped
abroad. When these containers are returned
empty to the Canadian manufacturer-which
sometimes may be a year or more after the
export-they will be admitted free of duty.
Schedule C, on page 32 of the bill, amends
the wording of item 1214, as recommended
by the Advisory Board on Wildlife Protection. The item at present prohibits a number
of birds and mammals, including the common
mongoose or mongoose of any kind; the common Mynah, Chinese Mynah, crested Mynah
or any other species of the starling family;
the Java sparrow, the rice bird, nutmeg finch,
or other species of the weaver bird family;
the European chaffinch and the great titmouse.
The Advisory Board on Wildlife Protection
have found it is unnecessary to retain the
prohibition on some of these birds, and the
wording of the item is being revised to
faciiltate administration.
Section 6 of the bill provides for the deletion of items 1211 and 1214 from Schedule C
to the Customs Tariff and inserts item 1214 as
specified in Schedule C to this bill.
Section 7 states that the amendments made
to tariff items in this bill shall in no way
affect the provisions of the Emergency
Exchange Conservation Act of 1947-48 or the
Customs Tariff amendment Act, 1939. This
avoids the necessity of amending the wording
of these Acts to bring them into line with the
wording in the Customs Tariff.
Section 8 brings into force on June 1, 1950,
the tariff changes provided for in Schedule B
of the bill.

SENATE
Section 9 provides that the tariff changes
made in Schedules A and C of this bill are
deemed to have come into force on the 29th
of March, 1950.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Why should retroactive
effect be given to Schedules A and C?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I take it that the practice
here is much like the practice followed with
the budget.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: This is part of the
budget.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But budget items are not
made effective until the date on which the
budget is announced.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: This is the date.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, that
concludes my brief explanation of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Vien: While I am in favour of the
bill, in principle, I object to some of its
provisions. May I suggest that we be allowed
to vote for second reading without committing ourselves to agreement on the principle, and that the subject-matter of the bill
be referred to a committee? This has been
done on a number of occasions in the past,
so that in committee honourable members
might not feel themselves bound to accept
any provisions with which they disagreed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is true that we
have sometimes referred the subject-matter
of a bill to committee, but I think it will be
found that in every such instance the bill
dealt with a specific matter rather than, as
this measure does, with numerous items. I
have great respect for my honourable
friend's wide knowledge of parliamentary
procedure, but it seems to me that any
honourable senator could properly vote for
second reading without in any way prejudicing his right to oppose in committee, and
afterwards in the Senate, any part of the bill
to which he may take exception.
Hon. Mr. Vien: With the assurance of the
leader of the government that the members
of the committee will be unfettered in their
consideration of this bill, I have no objection
to it receiving second reading now.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
I have been a member of this chamber for
quite a number of years, and there has always

seemed to me to be some misunderstanding on
this question. The fact should be well known
that when we give a bill second reading we
do not necessarily adopt its principle. After
second reading a bill may be referred to a
committee for the purpose of getting information about it. When it is reported back
to the house, and third reading is moved, our
rules give us the right to again debate its
principle.
Even after third reading, and
before a bill is passed by the house, there
may be discussion on it.
When my honourable friend from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) occupied the office
of Speaker of this chamber there were several
instances of bills being discussed as to
principle after second reading. It is my
understanding that under our rules we have
that right, and do not need to ask for it
as a favour.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

RED RIVER FLOODS
MANITOBA FLOOD RELIEF FUND

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, may I ask the indulgence of the house
for the purpose of making the following
announcement with respect to flood relief in
Manitoba.
The people of the province of Manitoba,
particularly those of the towns and farms
along the Red River from the United States
boundary to Lake Winnipeg, and in the municipalities adjacent to the city of Winnipeg, as
55950--24

well as in the city itself, are experiencing at
the present time one of the worst economic
disasters that has ever occurred in any part
of Canada.
The extent of the damage and the loss in
property and personal effects caused by the
flooding waters of the Red River may never
be properly assessed or recovered. That government assistance will be needed on a huge
scale there is no doubt. Already there have
come generous offers of assistance from other
provinces and from sources outside of
Canada; but more will be needed.
With the object of assisting in the rehabilitation of those whose homes and properties
have been destroyed, a voluntary flood relief
fund has been established. It is known as
the Manitoba Flood Relief Fund. Its chairman is Mr. H. W. Manning, Vice-President of
the Great West Life Assurance Company,
Winnipeg, and its objective is to raise $10
million.
Believing that there are many members of
the Senate, of the House of Commons, of the
Press Gallery, and of the staffs of the Senate
and the House of Commons, as well as other
Ottawa people who would like to contribute
to this fund, representatives from Manitoba
have organized a committee which will be
prepared to accept contributions to this fund.
The personnel of the committee is as
follows:
W. G. Weir, House of Commons; J. Arthur
Ross, House of Commons; Stanley H.
Knowles, House of Commons; Hon. A. L.
Beaubien, The Senate; Chester A. Bloom,
Press Gallery; John Bird, Press Gallery;
L. Clare Moyer, Clerk of the Senate; H.
Crossley Sherwood, Staff of the House of
Commons.
Any member of this committee will accept
contributions and arrange to issue the proper
receipt.
I might add, honourable senators, that a
similar announcement is being made in the
House of Commons this afternoon.
On May 12, the acting Minister of National
Revenue stated in the House of Commons that
cash donations made to responsible organizations for Manitoba flood relief may be claimed
by the donors as deductions from income tax,
in accordance with section 26A of the Income
Tax Act.
I thank the house for its courtesy in allowing me to make this statement at this time.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
as a senator from Manitoba, may I be permitted to endorse the statement made by the
honourable member from Provencher (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), and to say that the purpose in
raising the $10 million is to do things which

Act in 1937.

MAY 23, 1950
Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 are designed ta bring
the Act up ta date by the repeal of sections
which have become obsolete or which are now
given effect to by other Acts, or by incorporation into Acts of other departments.
Section 2 of the Act repeals a section inserted in 1936 at the direct request of the
United States and Japanese governments after
a trade agreement had been made in 1935.
This section, in effect, provides an appeal ta
the Tariff Board of values fixed by the
minister under section 43 of the Act. The
minister, in taking action to fix the value on
goods imparted inta Canada under conditions
that are considered prejudicial or injurious
ta other industries or the Canadian producers,
does so under the authorization of the Gavernor in Council. It is now f elt that the government must remain responsible for the action
taken under this section.
Section 3 provides an oppartunity ta ahl
persans whose interests might bie affected, ta
become parties ta an appeal ta, the Tariff
Board or ta the Exchequer Court. It further
requires the publication of a notice of appeal
in the Canada Gazette twenty-ane days prior
ta the hearing, so that interested parties will
have adequate notice.
Section 8 is an amendment which provides
for the mitigation of statutory penalties
applied in the case of second offenders. As
the law now stands, a persan is considered a
second offender regardless of the length, of
time that might intervene between his first
and second indictable offences under the
Customs Act. It is now provided that after a
period of five years a second offence will not
be regarded as such, and that the statutary
minimum term of imprisonmient be reduced
from three years ta one year. It was thought
that this would assist in a better enforcement
of the law, because at the present time the
heavy penalty maýkes it difficult ta get a conviction.
Section 1 was agreed ta.
On section 2-repeal:
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Section 2 repeals subsection 3 of section 43, which was inserted
in 1936 as a resuit of trade agreements made
in 1935 between Canada, the United States
and Japan. This section, I might say, affects
only countries outside the Geneva agreement.
Article 7 of that agreement sets up the
basis of valuation:
The contracting parties recognize the validity of
the general principles of valuation set forth in the
following paragraphs of this article, and, they undertake ta give effect ta such principles..
I will nat read them alI. The one in which
we are interested cornes under clause 2 (a):

the Imported. merchandise on which duty is assessed.

or of like merchandise, and should flot; be based
on the value of merchandise of national origin or on
arbitrary fictjtious values.
Then "1actual value" is defined in the next
paragraph.
The purpose of this section is ta, prevent
the imiportation from certain countries of
goods that would injuriously affect our awn
industries.
The countries to which this
section would apply are Abyssinia, Afghanistan, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Arabia, Bulgaria,
Egypt, Germany (Eastern Zone), Honduras,
Hungary, - Iran (Persia), Iraq, Japan, Peru,
Roumania, Russia and Siam.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is the part of Germany
known as West Germany within the Geneva
system?
Han. Mr. McKeen: Yes, it cames under
the »Geneva agreement.
Section 43A o! the Act, which is also
repealed by section 2 of the bill, was introduced in 1937 merely ta ratify and confirm valuations established under section 43
prior ta that date.
Section 2 was agreed ta.
On section 3-appeals ta the Tariff Board:
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The main feature o! this
amendment is that it gives the right ta
become a party ta an appeal ta persans whose
interests could be affected by a decision of
the Tariff Board or the Exchequer Court.
It may be of interest to the committee ta
knaw that since the constitution of the present
Tariff Board, in April 1949, fifty-six appeals
have been presented. Of these, twelve were
withdrawn, one was considered autside the
board's jurisdiction, five are awaiting hearing,
sixteen were allowed, eighteen were dismissed, one was partly dismissed, and in three
cases the decisions are pending.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think the important
feature of section 3 is a widening of the
class of people wha may appeal ta the Tariff
Board or the Exchequer Court from a decision
of the deputy minister. Under the present
law an appeal may be made only by an
importer who feels himself aggrieved by a
decision of the deputy minister. Well, o!
course, as honourable senatars will recognize,
decisians may affect many more persons
than importers of the gaods in question. In
my own practice I have known one or two
cases where that has been true. This amendment will permit an appeal ta be made ta the
Tariff Board or the Exchequer Court by
any persan, whether an importer or not, who
deems himself aggrieved by a decision of the
deputy minister.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is why notice of the
hearing of an appeal has to be published in
the Canada' Gazette?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I thank the honourable
senator for his remarks. The business of an
importer might be only the selling of the
article as to which the deputy minister has
made a decision, and many other persons
might be more seriously affected than the
importer. For example, a certain decision
if not upset might cause a manufacturer to
close down his plant.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-sections repealed:
Hon. Mr. McKeen: This section repeals
sections 58, 59 and 61 of the Customs Act.
Sections 58 and 59 should not be in the
Act but are properly included in the Customs
Tariff Schedule, which provides a general
classification for goods not enumerated elsewhere in the tariff.
Tariff item 711 reads:
Al goods not enumerated in this schedule as
subject to any other rate of duty, and not otherwise
declared free of duty, and not being goods the importation whereof is by law prohibited:
British Preferential Tariff 15 per cent.
Most Favoured Nation Tariff 25 per cent.
General Tariff 25 per cent.

Section 61 is made obsolete by tariff item
156. Under section 61 the duty on liquor was
based on the flavouring. I do not know
whether the department ran short of customs
officers to taste various liquors in order to
determine the tariff item under which they
came, or whether after tasting a dozen or so
varieties they were not competent to express
an opinion. Anyway, the department in its
wisdom has decided to do away with the
flavouring test. The domestic excise duty on
whisky is $11 per proof gallon, and the
customs aut.s are: British Preference, $4.50
plus $7 per proof gallon; Most Favoured
Nation, $5 plus $7 per proof gallon, and General Tariff, $10 plus $7 per proof gallon.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5-issue of writs of assistance:
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Under sections 144 and
145 of the Customs Act any officer may swear
out a search warrant and, after so doing,
conduct a search. Section 149 authorizes the
holder of a writ of assistance to enter at any
time of day or night and, in case of necessity
to break open any door or doors and enter any
chest or package in order to search, seize and
secure goods liable to forfeiture.
The writ of assistance is a permanent search
warrant and a visible proof of an officer's
authority to require assistance from the public.
According to the police, the document is in-

valuable in less settled parts of the country.
When issued by the Exchequer Court it is
valid wherever the holder may be sent in
Canada. Formerly writs of assistance could
be obtained from any superior court in any
province, on the request of a senior officer in
the district. Since 1927, however, the practice
has been to obtain writs of assistance from the
Exchequer Court only, and, since 1932, always
in favour of Mounted Police officers of the
preventive service. The writ of assistance
under this amendment will only be issued by
the Exchequer Court on the request of the
Attorney General of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is a writ of assistance?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It is a permanent search
warrant, and authorizes an officer to require
assistance from the public.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It authorizes a policeman to
request aid from spectators, for instance?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Yes. With a writ of
assistance an officer can ask any person for
assistance in order to cope with an offender
or offenders against the Act.
Section 5 was agreed to.
On section 6-section repealed:
Hon. Mr. McKeen: This repeals section 156
of the Customs Act. This section provides
that every writ of assistance granted before
the coming into force of the Act shall remain
in force. As the effective date of the Act was
1883, a man would now have to be in his 90's
in order to have had a writ issued to him
before the Act came into force. All writs
which came into force before 1883 will have
lapsed through time, so the section is no
longer necessary.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 7 and 8 were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The bill was reported without amendment.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. H. Taylor moved second reading
of Bill X-7, an Act to incorporate the Association of Kinsmen Clubs
He said: Honourable senators will note
that this bill is in the usual form of a private

MAY 23, 1950
bill seeking an Act of incorporation. The
objects of the association are found in section
2 of the bill.
For the information of the house, the
Kinsmen organization is a union of service
clubs carrying on activities in about 150
centres throughout Canada. The Kinsmen
Club is similar to the Rotary Club, the
Kiwanis Club and the Lions Club, with the

exception that its active membership, consisting only of young men under forty years
of age, is confined exclusively to Canada.
Because of the growth of the Kinsmen
organization throughout Canada, its executive has deemed it necessary to have the
clubs incorporated, and the application is
now being made in the. form of this bill.
As I shall move that this bill be referred

to the appropriate committee after it has
received second reading, perhaps no further
explanation is necessary at this time. When
the bill is considered in committee the officers
of the association will appear to answer any
questions honourable senators may wish to
ask.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask whether there
is evidence that the 150 clubs have all agreed
to this legislation?
Hon. Mr. Taylor: Honourable senators, the
only evidence I have of that is the assurance
given me by those who are petitioning
parliament on behalf of the association. My
information is that the officers of the organization are making this application on behalf
of the clubs. In any event, the members

of the executive will be prepared to answer
such questions when the bill is considered
in committee.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Did my honourable friend
mention the fact that there is an age limit
for membership in the Kinsmen Club?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, he said forty years.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: Membership is limited
to men under forty years of age.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I was about to suggest
that this order be discharged and be placed
on the order paper for Thursday next. I
should perhaps inform the house that the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), who is expected to explain this
bill, will not be in the house before Thursday.
I hope that by then the bill will have been
printed and distributed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I hope that the bill will
be in our hands well before Thursday. As
I said on a previous occasion, I have read
the bill and found it very complicated.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Does my friend refer
to the bill in its original form, or as passed
in another place?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I read the bill in its original
form, and I also read 'the debate which took
place in the other house, but I still do not
understand what the bill is all about.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I gather that the measure
is now more complicated than it was in its
original form.
Hon. Mr. Haig: From a reading of the
debates of the other place, I believe that is
so, for the bill has been amended considerably. Certainly it should be in our hands in
its amended form in time to be examined
before Thursday.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I quite agree with the
honourable leader opposite. I too read the
debate in the other place, and noted that there
were a number of technical amendments
moved. If copies of the bill are not available
well before Thursday, the motion for second
reading can again be postponed.

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in this debate, I first

wish to compliment the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) for moving

SENATE
this important resolution, and thus affording
an opportunity to discuss the proposed setting
up of a federal union from amongst the free
democratic countries which sponsored and
signed the North Atlantic Treaty. Whilst I
am personally in agreement with the object
of the proposal-namely a federal union of
western nations-I trust that it may receive
the support of all honourable senators, even
though some may think that it is somewhat
too idealistic and perhaps premature.
If,
however, the resolution reaches the stage
where amendments are being proposed, I
should like to see it altered to the effect that
Canada, and not the United States of America,
approve the calling of such a conference, I
shall now proceed to give my reasons for such
a change.
I am one of those who believe, from
information gleaned from various quarters,
that the free democratic countries in Europe
today have more confidence in Canada than
they have in the United States. It matters
little how powerful a nation may be, the
confidence of other nations is an important
factor.
I am sure honourable senators will agree
that Great Britain never would have held
world leadership for so long a time, but for
the fact that most of the nations of the world
had confidence in her leadership.
'Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Bon. Mr. Reid: My own belief is that in
the minds of many of the nations of the world
today the United States does not enjoy the
same position that Great Britain held for so
many years. Reports coming from Europe
and from delegations which have visited the
continent seem to be enthusiastic about how
well suggestions made by Canada have been
received. I feel strongly that if the suggestion proposed by this resolution were made
by Canada instead of by the United States it
would be received with great favour.
Some honourable senators may not have
read the recent newspaper article about the
part Canada is playing in support of the

twelve-nation treaty to fight communism
tooth and nail through a continuing council
of deputies meeting in London. I shall not

read the whole article; I believe the salient
points are these:
Canada's participation, even though on an informal basis, was hailed by government spokesmen
here as of even greater importance than her military
commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty. The
military commitments were restricted to a mutual
assistance agreement in the event of any one of the
member nations being attacked.
This country's military contribution-

That is, Canada's contribution.
-would be no more and no less, comparatively,
than the contribution made by any other nation
under the North Atlantic Treaty.
The writer adds, without giving the name,

that the source of his statement is a member
of the Cabinet.
I think most honourable senators will agree
that when one looks over the international
scene it is evident that the Canadian nation
holds a high place in the mindis and hearts of
many countries of the world.
I do not intend to speak at length about the
North Atlantic pact, but it is worth while
to point out that, although essentially its

significance is military there are indications
of something more than military preparation
-important

though that may be-against an

aggressor. Basically the purpose of the treaty
is the promotion of security; but it was felt
that in the long run military measures would
not be sufficient to resist a fanatical faith
which promises a social and economic millenium; and therefore, that the parties- to the
treaty should assist one another to improve
social and economic conditions in the North
Atlantic area.

During the negotiations lead-

ing to the treaty, the Canadian Government
pressed strongly for the inclusion of provisions for this purpose. This objective is
covered by Article II, which provides that
the parties "will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly
international relations by strengthening their
free institutions."
Hence I say, honourable
senators, that the resolution proposed by the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) is a step in the right direction, and
not, as some seem to think, premature.
The idea of federal union is not a new
one.
For many years there have been
those who, owing to the division of the
world into two distinct camps and the threat
of the Soviet Union, have advocated a union
of the free democracies in order that we may
protect ourselves.
If this should have no
other result than to lower the tariffs which
have prevented people in some countries from
freely receiving goods from others, it would
be a blessing to mankind. It is a well known
fact, and one for which the United States
must take some blame, that high tariff barriers were responsible in large measure for
the Second World War. From 1930 to 1939
country after country, led by the United
States, raised its tariff walls so high that other
nations could not procure the goods and the
food they needed.
For instance, we in
Canada, although we had food in plenty,
could not sell or ship it to needy countries.

Prohibitive duties were imposed on the sale

MAY 23, 1950
of our wheat to France and some other countries during the years immediately preceding
the last war.
We give a great deal of lip service to our
way of life, but I wonder how really willing
we are to sacrifice in order to preserve it. In
looking up some figures before I came here
I was astounded to find that the Canadian
people spend annually $630 million on alcoholic liquors and some $311 million on
tobacco. Yet many people are heard to complain of the size of our defence expenditures.
They seem to be unaware of the cloud which
threatens to encompass us, the great dangers
that we face from the military might of
others. In parenthesis let me say to honourable senators who sometimes are critical of
the United States that we may thank God
that we have close to our doors the vast
military might and industrial strength of that
country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: This I say without minimizing in the least the great task which Great
Britain undertook -and the great burden
she carried for well over a hundred years,
and whereby in 1939 and 1940 not only Canada
but every other country, including Soviet
Russia, was saved from destruction by the
military might of Germany.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: So, realizing that first things
must come first, while we favour the federation which is contemplated in the resolution,
we must not overlook the immediate issue
which confronts us. That issue has been
expressed in plain terms by Stalin, who says
that the two systems cannot live side by
side. Mr. Robert Hamilton, who, on behalf
of the New York Times, regularly attends the
sessions of the United Nations, tells us that
Soviet Russia will probably withdraw from
that body after the Geneva Assembly in
September passes on the question of the
entry of Communist China.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Yes-Communist China.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The withdrawal of Russia
from the United Nations will be no great loss
to that body, because she has contributed
nothing to it and has merely used its meetings as a sounding board for Communist
propaganda. I use the word "communism"
as a convenient term for the system under
which the Soviet Union operates, though, as
is well known to any student, the Karl Marx
brand of communism has never been practised in Soviet Russia: what exists there is
government by an oriental group led by
Stalin and enforced by the military or by
fear of the secret police.

Of recent years Canadians have seen
Stalinism advocated not only by agents who
have come from abroad, but by hundreds of
Canadian citizens who, whether they like to
openly admit it or not, are sympathetic to the
Soviet system. I believe the greatest harm
is done by men who, like the Red Dean, get
a quick and carefully planned look at Soviet
Russia and come back after a brief visit with
astounding fairy tales of what they think they
saw there. I think Winston Churchill would
have called the Dean "a sheep in sheep's
clothing" and those who have kept a small
flock, and know how silly some sheep can be,
will understand exacty what is meant. This
cleric, after a very short trip to Russia, tells
us not only some of the things he thought he
saw, but makes statements too ridiculous and
foolish to be quoted. I trust that I am not
giving him undue publicity by mentioning his
name in this chamber. He is carrying on

church, forgetting all about Christ.
declares to the people of this country that
"the United States will not stand before the
great Soviet Russia; that they will be wiped
out."
I remember some of the Japanese who
came to Canada before the war telling us
that the United States would be a push-over.
The Orientals and Stalinists-and do not forget for one moment that Stalin and some of
the inner group are really Orientals-do not
fully understand our way of thinking or
living, and perhaps they are really convinced
that the United Nations would be a push-over.
We all remember how Charles Lindbergh,
after he had accepted the invitation to visit
Germany before the last war, returned to
America and told his fellow countrymen that
no nation could stand up against the military
might of Germany. Sometimes I think the
ancients had some worth-while practices.
Those of you who read Holy Writ will recall
how they dealt with false prophets: they were
beheaded and that was the end of false
prophecy. Sometimes I think we have something to learn from the ancients.
I am going to relate a little anecdote to
illustrate just what I know about the sympathetic leanings of some Canadians towards
Soviet Russia. Approximately five or six
years ago Moscow asked the United States if
she would be agreeable to allowing Soviet
fishery experts to visit the Fraser river and
the newly constructed Hell's Gate Fishways.
As this was a matter affecting the International Pacifie Salmon Fisheries Commission,
the United States officials took the matter up
on a high level with the Canadian Government, and eventually the three Canadian
commissioners were asked their views as to
the visit of these Soviet scientists. When the

SENATE

letter came to me as a member of the commission, I acknowledged it and said something to this effect, "Why certainly, let the
three Russian scientists come along and see
everything we have; but let them do so on
the condition that they allow three of our
fishery experts to visit Russia to see what
they are doing in Russia with their fisheries".
I could see nothing wrong with that reply.
Why should we invite our enemies to observe
everything in our land while they place an
iron curtain around theirs? When my answer
was made public, I received scathing and
denunciatory letters from Canadians who
accused me of committing every sin under
Heaven. They claimed that I wanted to
ferment war with Soviet Russia. If these
Canadians-born and raised here with all
the advantages the best country in the world
provides,-could write to me in the strain
in which they did on behalf of Russia, I
wonder what will happen if the military
forces of Soviet Russia ever threaten to land
on this great North American continent?
Honourable senators, I take exception to
the type of propaganda we read and hear
these days in Canada. I do not know how
many of us realize how powerfully people
are influenced by what they read and hear.
Whilst I am not accusing the Canadian press
or the CBC of any deliberate wrong doing,
I think they should pay more heed to the way
they handle news despatches from Soviet
Russia.
Our newspaper headlines read
"Soviet Russia claims the United States is
lying", and then we have to look in small
print for a denial of this statement. We also
hear over the CBC that the Soviet Russia
uses strong language in denouncing democratic countries, and so on. I maintain that
this kind of propaganda, innocent though it
may be-and indeed some are inclined to
believe it is not so innocent-is doing a great
injury to Canada and to peace because it
may fall on fertile ground and take root.
As the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) pointed out, we are now
experiencing a war of ideals, a cold war
between Sovietism on the one side and democracy on the other. I think most senators
will agree with me that the Christian religion
gives man more freedom than does the
materialistic-fervoured religion of communism, and the more he forsakes Christianity
the more he becomes enslaved. I realize that
the more we do for our people the longer we
shall be able to stave off the threat of communism, but I hold to the view that we are
in danger of losing our greatest bulwark
against -communism by losing our religious
faith. We cannot deny the fact that the
fervour of those who believe in Stalinism or
communism is generally speaking greater

than our own. I am astounded when I hear
so many ministers of the gospel preaching
and instilling into the minds and hearts of
our people the fear of the atomic bomb.
Recently I listened to a lecture by a prominent clergyman, and his whole talk was
about what would happen to us when the
atomic bomb was let loose. Later he asked
me what I thought of his address and I
said, "Well, I have been wondering whether
you are truly a minister of the Christian
gospel and whether you really believe in
God." I asked him "Have you no faith at
all?" Honourable senators, we must not lose
our faith and we must regain some of our
lost fervour. I read an article recently which
claimed that religion was losing its hold,
and that the attendance at ichurches was
failing. But I shall not go into that today.
Honourable senators, I want to mention
three different forms of government. The
first is nationalistic. Nationalism has made
the modern state and aided the subsequent
rise of racism, fascism, communism and
socialism. This was done by getting men
accustomed to sacrificing themselves to their
state, wherever it might be. Then there is
the totalitarian form of government, such as
that of the Soviets; and finally there is the
free federation of governments, as proposed
t
'e present resolution.
The honourable senator from Churchill said
that in his opinion China was now completely
controlled by Soviet Russia.
I wish the
people of this country would give a little
more study and thought to the countries in
the Pacific. I sometimes wonder how many
of those who speak glibly about these countries have made any real study of what takes
place there. It may be true that today the
Soviets have a large hand in the communistic
government of China; but I claim that if they
have we ourselves are partly to blame for it.
It is only a few short years since we idolized
General Chiang Kai-shek's government, and
I well remember his lady being referred to
in the House of Commons as "immortal".
However, anyone who has ever given even a
little study to China knows that in no other
country have the rulers been so corrupt and
given to graft as were the rulers of China
before the upheaval occurred.
I know
nothing about the character of the new rulers.
What I do know is that in the past we shut
our eyes to whalt was taking place in China,
and now-like St. Peter, who followed Christ
afar off-we are willing to follow the United
States.
I wonder how many Canadians realize the
actual conditions in China and have asked
themselves whether, if the terrible conditions
there were to continue forever, a few of the

MAY 23, 1950
rich on top were to be allowed for all time to
grind down the millions of poor people. We
paid no attention at all to the realities of life
in that country; we backed up one regime;
and so today we wonder what our relations
will be with the group that has now taken
charge. Is it surprising that that group has
turned for help to Soviet Russia and is getting
it?
From my knowledge of the Orient, I say
that we are faced with a great future danger.
It is true that General MacArthur is building
up the Japanese nation. But what is this
being done for? It is well known that the
purpose of building up Japan into a great
military power, is to form a bulwark when
the time comes for Soviet Russia to take on
the Orient. And from what I know of
Orientals, I express the belief-which will be
down in print-that on whatever side Japan
will fight, China will be on the opposite side.
There is such bitter enmity and hatred
between the two nations that I cannot ever
picture them fighting together as allies. I
doubt also if Moscow could or ever will
control the Chinese.
I am making these remarks in the hope
that they will help arouse a greater interest
on the part of Canadians in affairs of the East.
I trust that in laying down our future policy
we shall not blindly follow the moves of any
country, but that instead, in international
affairs, Canada will give some leadership
where needed.
I believe that the great
esteem in which Canada is held abroad will
enable this country to be a powerful factor
in the progress towards peace.
Honourable senators, I had not expected to
speak so long. I am in favour of the resolution, but I should like to see Canada i-tself,
rather than the United States, making a move
to induce other free nations to join a federation. That suggestion, of course, has nothing
at all to do with the principle of the resolution before us. I realize how tremendously
difficult it will be to put such a proposal into
effect. There are, for instance, difficulties as
to tariffs and trade; but at every international trade conference on these subjects,
Canada has shown able leadership and used
her influence towards the reduction of tariff
barriers, an example which I am sorry to say
has not been followed by any other country,
particularly the United States.
In closing, I wish to utter a warning to our
people. Let us never for one moment forget
Stalin's statement that the two economic
systems of the present day cannot live side
by side, and so let us not be sidetracked from
preparing for any onslaught, for remember
Russia is building up a huge war machine,

more powerful than even Germany ever had.
Finally, ask yourselves this question: What
for?
Hon. P. R. DuTremblay: Honourable senators, I should like to say just a few words
about this interesting resolution. After
having listened to the various senators who
have taken part in the discussion, I think
that the proposal before us is more or less
academic, and in my opinion it would not
be a practical one for Canada to adopt.
The resolution is idealistic and has been
endorsed by all who have so far spoken
upon it, but it asks us to approve a departure
from what has been the policy of this country
ever since, I should say, the war of 1812
between Britain and the United States.
The resolution certainly favours a departure frorn the policy followed for some
twenty-five years by Mr. King, the former
Prime Minister of this country. Under that
policy, which was accepted by the people
of Canada, we were free of any embarrassing
obligations to any other country. In fact,
in different election campaigns the Liberal
party declared that we were not even obliged
to go to the support of another member of
the British Commonwealth of Nations; that
each member of the Commonwealth was free
to choose for itself whether it would or
would not take part in any war. To preserve freedom of choice in this matter was
one of the reasons why we took part in the
last war.
But what is now being proposed by this
resolution which has been so ably sponsored
and supported here? It is proposed that
Canada send delegates to meet with delegates
from the various democracies that form what
we call the Atlantic Union, and that the
delegates be empowered to draft plans for
a federation. I wish to remind honourable
senators that if Canada joins a federation
such as is proposed here she will have to
make some sacrifices of her sovereignty, and
our people will have to give up some of
the rights which they, as Canadians, now
possess. For example, if one of the other
countries should become embroiled in war,
Canada would at the very least be required
to pay large sums of money towards defraying the cost of the war. I submit that we
must not become partners with any other
country in this way, for to do so would be
contrary to the policy that has always been
followed in Canada.
There is another reason against becoming
a member of such an international federation,
and this reason is more important for Canada,
perhaps, than for any other country. It
would not be possible, I believe, for all
these countries with their different customs,

CONVENTION OF NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler.
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by the United States of America of a Convention of delegates from the democracies which
sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty and representing the principal political parties of such democracies, for the purpose of exploring how far their
peoples and the peoples of such other democracies
as the Convention may invite to send delegates, can
apply among them within the framework of the
United Nations, the principles of federal union.

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,

I think we all have good reason to congratulate the honourable member from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) for the service that he has
rendered by placing this resolution before us
for discussion. It raises very wide questions,
but I believe we are all agreed that they are
timely questions and questions which this
generation will be called upon to decide. I
think also that the honourable senator deserves our thanks for the response which his
resolution has evoked in the excellent speeches
that have been made, particularly by the
honourable senators from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin)

SENATE
But today, honourable senators, one can
go around the world in eighty hours. In
fact, I think it is only fair to say that between
the time of Confederation and today-that
is, within the lifetime of one generationthe means of communication have advanced
more than in the whole previous history of
mankind. And facilities of communication
are of course not confined to actual physical
travel. There is communication by ear and
communication by eye. Today an important
speech made by a statesman in one country
is heard around the world as the very
words proceed from the mouth of the orator.
We have in the movies a means of seeing
what bas taken place in other parts of the
world. Indeed, the science of television is
only in its infancy, and I do not think it
would be rash to predict that before many
years have gone by people in all parts of
the world will be able not only to hear, but
actually to see, things that go on in fardistant lands. That, I think, would be the
nrst great change which the Father of Confederation would observe.
The second great change he would notice
would be that the world bas become more
interdependent economically than it ever was
before. The progress here is perhaps not as
startling as in the field of communications,
but it is great enough in all conscience. Consider the Canada of 1867, which was largely

and New Westminister (Hon. Mr. Reid). These
gentlemen have dealt very largely with the
present international situation as it relates to
the resolution, but I do not intend to follow
them f ar along that line of thought.
Upon that branch of the subject I shall
content myself for the moment with saying
that for compelling reasons we are all of us
groping for a means of strengthening the
bonds between the democratic countries of
the world, and more particularly between the
countries which are parties to the Atlantic
Union.
Now may I deal for a few moments with
some of the historical trends which have
brought this about and have made this
resolution one of actuality? The resolution
talks about federal union. Well, in only
a little over a month from now it will be
eighty-three years since Canada achieved
federal union. That was an achievement
which in its time was a very great one,
the bringing together of a number of disparate and widely scattered settlements that
constituted the Canada of that day, I should
like honourable senators to engage with me,
if they will, in a little exercise of the imagination. Let us suppose that one of the
Fathers of Confederation were to come back
to this world today. What would appear
to him to be the principal changes that have
taken place in the world in the intervening
eighty-three years? I think the first thing

MAY 24, 1950
largely of what originally were small territorial units. Remember that 1867 was only
two years after the close of the American
Civil War, which finally determined that the
United States would be one country instead
of two; and three years were yet to pass
before the German Empire was formed in
1870, as a result of the Franco-Prussian war.
The same process of unification is true of the
kingdom of Italy. Even our own country
Canada, which was formed in 1867, has in the
intervening years made great progress
towards national status.
With the growth of nations in the past
seventy or eighty years there has come also
the growth of the spirit of nationalism or, if
you wish to call it so, the consciousness of
national identity, a feeling which sometimes
takes almost exaggerated, forms, but which
has become and is one of the strongest forces
of our time. Let me give you an example.
Nationalism is the only force in eastern
Europe which has so far shown itself capable
of standing up against and repelling the
strangling yoke of Soviet communism. I
refer, of course, to the Yugoslavia of Marshal
Tito.
To summarize, the Father of Confederation would find today, firstly, that the world
is much smaller; secondly, that it is much
more interdependent; and thirdly, that there
has been a great development of nations and
of nationalism, or national spirit.
Leaving aside his first two observations
for a few moments, and considering nationalism, it is apparent that here we run into
difficulty when we begin to talk about a
federal union of more than one nation. I
think we are all agreed that a federal union
will meet its great obstacle in the spirit of
nationalism, which is in the world today.
The question today is: Can the proud, selfreliant national units which constitute the
nations of the Atlantic Pact bring themselves
to surrender enough of their national sovereignty to a new superior body to make a
federal union possible? That, I say, is a
formidable difficulty, and it is one that has
been referred to by honourable senators who
have preceded me in this debate. I suppose
the basic question really is this: Will the
human mind stop at nationalism, or on the
other hand, will it be able to bring itself to
embrace a wider concept, that of which
Tennyson spoke when he talked about the
parliament of man, the federation of the
world? That is the question which we shall
have to ponder very seriously when considering this resolution.
Speaking in a historical sense, I wish to
say first that nationalism in its present form
is a more or less modern concept, dating

from a period not earlier than 100 or 150
years ago. Until the end of the eighteenth
century the loyalty of the average man was
bounded by a very much narrower concept
than that of his nationality: he was loyal to
his parish, his village, his town or his provI repeat, nationalism is a fairly
ince.
modern concept.
When we go back still further in human
history we find that in the past there have
been great movements of the minds of men
which have completely transcended and
ignored local boundaries or questions of race
or nation. Let us take for instance the field
of religion. In the Middle Ages, before the
Reformation, the whole Christian church of
western Europe acknowledged the supremacy
of the Pope, worshipped at one altar and
submitted to one religlous discipline; and,
with that unity, what prodigies mankind performed in those days! Let us think back to
the Crusades of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, when hundreds of thousands of
men from western Europe, of all nations and
all-tongues, made the pilgrimage to the Near
East for that one purpose which they at that
time considered supremely important-the
re-conquering for Christianity of the home
of the Redeemer of mankind. That surely
was a prodigious example of unity of the
human spirit. Yes, honourable senators, and
if one travels in the Near East today and
visits Cyprus, Syria or Palestine, one will
still see the remains of the tremendous
fortresses which the Crusaders built to protect the lands which they had recovered from
the Emperor Saladin and the infidel Turk.
To go even further back into human history, this time in the field of government:
between fifteen hundred and two thousand
years ago the whole of the civilized world
was subject to one law and one system of
public administration under the Roman
Empire. The writ of that empire ran from
the Euphrates on the east to the far confines
of Portugal on the west, and from Libya on
the south to the marches of Northumberland
on the north. That, again, was a great
example of the sort of union that mankind
can at times achieve. Yes: and the remains of
the Roman system still exist and form part
of our very thought and our very being.
Every great system of law by which the
countries of the world are governed today
has in greater or smaller degree its origin
in the law of Rome.
Honourable senators who have travelled in
Europe will recall that scattered over that
continent there remain many physical signs
of the greatness of Rome. I am not speaking
particularly of those, like the Coliseum at
Rome, which are well known; I am thinking

SENATE
of my own experience, travelling across the
border between Scotland and England, and
seeing the remains of the great wall which
the Romans built along that border in order
to keep the savage Picts and Scots from the
more prosperous country to the south. There
have been many occasions since that time
when Englishmen have devoutly wished that
that wall had become a permanent feature of
the landscape!
I remember seeing in a small provincial
town in Anjou, in southwestern France, a
medium-sized stone arena which the Romans
built two thousand years ago for the holding
of their circuses and the presentation of their
plays, an arena which is still used from
time to time for the holding of circuses and
the production of plays.
I begin to hear some honourable senators
say to themselves, "That is all very well, but
what has the Roman Empire to do with the
resolution we are discussing this afternoon?"
I suggest that it has this much to do with it.
Fifteen hundred years ago the whole of the
known civilized world was united under one
administration, one rule of law,-federal
union, if you like to call it that; and what I
am trying to point out is that what the human
brain has once achieved it can, should the
necessity arise, achieve again. I repeat,
"should the necessity arise".
That brings me to the consideration of the
next point that I want to discuss. Is something in the nature of federal union now
necessary? Has the necessity arisen?
In my view, honourable senators, we are
being forced into some closer integration of
civilized nations, some more effective means
of co-operation between the nations of the
western world, whether it be what is called
federal union, or some other method or
system.
As I said a few moments ago, the world
is becoming more and more interdependent.
That is the inevitable result of the prodigious
advance of science and invention in the last
few generations. And that advance is still
continuing; I think it is true to say that it
is accelerating. Surely the trouble in which
we find ourselves is this, that man's rapidly
expanding mastery over nature has left his
political institutions far behind. In scientific progress and machinery we are in the
middle of the twentieth century; in respect
of political machinery we are still at the
end of the nineteenth century. Let me give
an example-a rather striking one-of what
I mean. I refer to that grim pastime in which
throughout the ages mankind has been wont
to indulge: the making of war. Consider the
developments of the last few years in the

necessities of war. Until comparatively
recently, until a time well within the memory
of every honourable senator within the sound
of my voice, every nation, even a nation of
comparatively moderate size, was able to
maintain and equip its own army largely out
of its own resources. That state of things
has changed radically within the last twentyfive or thirty years. Today only a few of the
greatest nations have suficient means and
resources to maintain adequate forces in all
the branches of the armed services. The
reason is plain: recent scientific developments
have been too overwhelming. Reflect, for
instance, on the position of a nation that
wishes to establish and maintain a modern
air force: think of the vast amounts of
industrial equipment, the resources of skill
and of science which are needed if it is
to be kept in a reasonable state of efficiency.
Or take an even more recent example: it is
well known that there are only two nations,
or, let us say, two groups of nations in the
world which have sufficient resources to
manufacture the atomic bomb.
These things have become self-evident.
Small and medium nations are impotent to
act alone. Yet on the political level the
whole governmental machinery of the western world is still based on the theory that
each nation has a largely self-sufficient
military force. That theory is no longer valid:
indeed we are seeing today many attempts by
the western nations to create new machinery,
to build new forms for the purpose of trying
t0 bridge the gap which separates our
political systems of yesterday from the
scientific realities of today.
This resolution has reference to the nations
who are parties to the Atlantic Treaty, and
the purpose which I have been talking about
was the reason for this treaty. It is also
the reason for the new parliament of Europe,
which met for the first time last autumn at
Strasbourg, in which Mr. Winston Churchill
took such a prominent part; likewise it is
the reason for the Council of European
Economic Co-operation and all the other
agencies which mankind is endeavouring to
create to bridge the gap I mentioned; and,
indeed, it is responsible for the proposal
made last week by the government of France
to integrate its coal, steel and iron industries with the coal, steel and iron industries
of Germany and the rest of Western Europe.
I am pleased that the honourable gentleman
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) referred in
such enthusiastic terms to that offer, because
in my view it is one of the most promising
signs that has come out of Europe for many
months. In the text of what I am talking
about, just consider what that offer means.
If these industries in Western Europe are

really integrated, it wrnl render the economic
boundaries between those countries-and I
venture to say even the political bouandaries
-largely
meaningless. Those boundaries
will have lost their purpose and their
meaning.
Surely the question that faces us in considering this resolution is this. How far
and in what directions will the western
democracies have to go to bring their
political institutions into harmony with the
international realities of today?
Federal
union may be the answer; I do not know.
But this I will say: by the inexorable pressure of events we shall be f orced into new
forms and new systems of international
and perhaps of super-national action.

Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,

gone by.

that would be less dependent on the fancies

They insisted upon a Senate which would
represent the important principle of democracy, that despite the will of the majority
justice must prevail.
In nearly all cases the members of the
Senate are persons of wide experience and
mature judgment who feel the responsibility of
their positions. When I first entered the
Senate, fifteen of the senators then in the
house had been cabinet ministers in federal
governments, thirty-eight had been members
of the House of Commons, many had been
members of provincial cabinets or had served
in provincial legislatures, one had served for
six years on the Board of Railway Commissioners, several had represented Canada on
different diplomatic missions, and others were
outstanding farmers, leaders in industry, and
leading professional men.
Some of us are in the evening of life, but
I think you will agree with me that without
the wisdom which comes from long years of
experience, leadership in government might
be expected to follow a rather uncertain and
perilous course. In times of stress and national emergency, experience can contribute
an historical background and ensure sage
advice. By all means let us have more younger
men in the government, but let us also retain
the tempering influence of the older statesmen.

All this campaigning for votes on the floor
of the Commons, all this filibustering, all this
horse-play takes up much time in the Commons and is of enormous cost to the country.
The House of Commons should be reformed.
I hope you will support me in setting up a
committee, as such a committee could serve
a very useful purpose in bringing about the
much needed reform.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to speak at length on this
matter. I welcome the speech by the mover
of the resolution, the honourable gentleman
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross), but I am not
going to follow his line of argument.
The resolution proposes that a joint committee of both houses be set up for the purpose of seeing if the House of Commons can
be made to function more efficiently. But
before I deal with what I think should be
discussed by the committee, if one is
appointed, I wish to remind the house that
political life in this country has -changed somewhat since about 1920, when we began to
have three, and sometimes four or five
political parties instead of only two. Those
of us who have never sat in the House of
Commons cannot speak for that place; but
having been a member of the Manitoba house
for some seventeen years. I know something
of the situation in a provincial legisliature.
For part of the time during which I sat in
the legislature the house was made up of
only two parties, and during another period
there were five parties. When there were
only two parties the sessions used to last
about six or seven weeks, but with five parties
in the house the sessions ran from twelve to
fourteen weeks.
Let me describe briefly the merry-goround that we had there with four or five
parties, for it was exactly the same, on a
smaller scale, as what goes on in another
place. The government would make a statement. The Liberal opposition would say
something about it, then the Conservative
opposition would express its view, then the
C.C.F. opposition would air its opinion, followed by that of the Labour or Communist
opposition, and finally the government would
wind up the debate. Anyone who sits in the
gallery of the other house can see the same
kind of thing going on all the time. The
government makes a proposal, the official
opposition voices its criticism, followed by
that of the C.C.F. and the Social Credit
parties; and while this merry-go-round is
going on the thing in which the people
at large are interested, the improved government of this country, is often lost sight of.

I understand that a resolution was moved
the other day in another place proposing
that a committee be set up to inquire into
and examine the functions of this house. I
think I speak for the majority here when I
say that such a committee would be most welcome. From a long experience in public life
I am convinced that Canada would be
delighted to know something of the contribution the Senate has made to the welfare of
Canada during the 83 years since confederation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I listened with a great deal
of pleasure to the recent discussion on the
resolution proposed in the other place, and I
do not in any way criticize the government
for voting against it. The government having
decided that the resolution constituted a vote
of confidence, it is well and good that members supporting the government should vote
against it. Nevertheless, I believe that the
Senate would welcome such a committee. The
resolution now before us should of course be
passed, and we should have an opportunity to
suggest to the members of the other house
what would make for greater efficiency in its
operations.
The British parliament found that under a
system allowing of unlimited debate it could
not function efficiently.
The House of
Representatives in the United States found
that it could not carry on unless debates were
limited. True, the Senate in that country
has no such restrictions, but it consists of only
ninety-six members.
I recognize the high ideals of the leader
of the present government and the qualities
possessed by the leaders of the official opposition, of the C.C.F. and of the Social Credit
parties, and I have no criticism to make of
these men personally. Canada would be safe
under a government led by any one of them.
We may not agree with the policies which
some of them advocate, and for that reason
might not want to see a government under
their leadership; but as far as their capacity,
honesty and love of Canada are concerned, I
make no criticism whatsoever.
I am strongly of the opinion that the procedure of the House of Commons should be
examined, with a view to finding a better and
more efficient way of handling the business
of this country. The issues before parliament
at the present time are broadly those of taxation and expenditures, including expenditures
for social services and other related matters.
Let me give an illustration of how time is
wasted in the House of Commons. The other
day that house spent six hours discussing
whether or not the federal government should

SENATE
contribute to the cost of education in the provinces. This question, which is purely a
matter of government policy, could not be
decided by debate. Why then, should five or
six men on one side of the house make long
speeches about it? If, for instance, I propose
an investigation into the procedure and functions of the Senate, I see no reason why a half
a dozen members who agree with my views
should speak at some length about it. I think
the members of the House of Commons should
limit themselves in some way.
I draw the attention of honourable senators to the language of the motion now before
us. It says in part:
. . . to study suggested constitutional changes
affecting the House of Commons, ineluding the
better functioning of the House of Commons in our
parliamentary systern ...

It is to that particular passage that I am now
addressing my remarks.
As a member of the Manitoba Legislature,
in which there were four or five parties
represented-there are four in the House of
Commons-I observed how, without reaching
any better conclusion as a result, twice as
much time as necessary was spent in discussing a subject. That is inevitable.
I could suggest some other topics for discussion with a view to the better functioning
of Parliament. Is the system of voting for
only one of three or four or five candidates a
desirable one? In the present parliament the
bad effects are not so evident, but over half
the members of the last House of Commons,
and a large percentage of the membership of
the present one, were elected by minority
vote. Take the recent by-election in the
Toronto constituency of Broadview: although
the successful candidate had a majority of
4,300, he received less than half of the votes
cast. Another example is the by-election in
Hamilton. The successful candidate-and I
am sure all of us, irrespective of politics, are
happy that a woman was elected to the other
place-obtained only a minority of the total
vote. I think parliament might consider
whether the election law should be so revised.
as to make that kind of thing impossible. A
change bas been made in some countries by
means of the single transferable vote. My
honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) says we cannot get it. It is true
that, no matter what party is in power, a
government will never initiate legislation for
the single transferable vote. Their point of
view is that they got in under the old system
and they had better hang on to it. Saskatchewan could not be induced to adopt the
single transferable vote; a province will only
do it when they are in opposition.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Explain that!

Hon. Mr., Haig: I would be inclined to
favour proportional representation under certain circumstances. I admit that most people
are opposed to it, but it has the merit of providing representation for minorities which
otherwise would have no representation at
all.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Would you not then
have more parties?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It would not make any
difference to the number of parties. In the
House of Commons at the present time four
parties are represented, and there are no
more in the Legislature of Manitoba, which
is elected by proportional representation.
Manitoba is a very cosmopolitan province;
and as a result of this system representation
bas been provided for various important elements. I do not say that I am in favour of
it, but it should be considered by an independent body; and if members of the Senate
were on that committee they would be interested only in seeing that the system of election for the House of Commons was fair to
the people of Canada, and would not care a
rap which party got the advantage.
One or two other suggestions occur to me.
I know it is not deemed good manners for a
member of this house to tell the other house
how to amend its rules, but it seems to me
there should be a limit to the number of
speeches; and after a member bas spoken
several hundred times in a session that limit
should be reached. I do not like to name
anyone in this connection, but there are three
or four members whose speeches, to my
knowledge, number close to the seven hundred. With a little addition they could use
up all the time of the session. I hardly ever
go into the other place but two certain members are holding the floor. It may be right
that they should speak so often; possibly they
are the most brilliant men in this country; but
it seems to me that the other two hundred and
sixty members also have some ability, or they
would not be where they are, and they should
have a chance to express their opinions now
and again.
Not long ago there was a filibuster in the
other place. A filibuster can be a good thing,
but in my opinion, after it bas gone on for
three months the bill which is being so
opposed should pass automatically.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The government can apply
closure.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Another change which would
be of the nature of reform is that anyone who
bas ever been a member of the other place
should be ineligible forever to become a member of the Senate. This proposal for the "reform of the Senate" is one which all members

Hon. Mr. Haig: My answer is that I do not
believe in retroactive legislation. If members
of the other place who have reached the age
of sixty-five are to be regarded as eligible for
transfer to the Senate, there must be about
fifty who are now in this age category. Of
course all of them could not be appointed at
once; and as time went by more would become
eligible. I believe that, irrespective of age,
no member of the House of Commons, past or
present, should become a member of this
chamber. I recommend this suggestion to the
serious consideration of the other place.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not a chance.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it would make for
greater efficiency in the other house, and I am
sure it would not lessen the efficiency of our
own. Needless to say I did not come from the
House of Commons.
It had occurred to me to name two or three
of the members of that body who take up a
great deal of time, but our lady member over
here (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) shakes her head, and
I am prone to follow a woman's advice.
In conclusion, I would remind the government of the day and the various oppositions
in the othèr place that they should remove the
bean from their own eye before they take
the mote out of the eye of the other fellow.

INCOME TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of Bill 177, an Act to amend the Income
Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable sena-tor from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to explain this bill.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, to give an explanation of the Income Tax
Act itself is difficult enough, but I do not
think it is as difficult as the task I am now
facing, that of making an explanation of
amendments to the general income tax law.
In poring over the amendments in the form
in which they necessarily occur, I find that the
references and cross-references to sections
are so numerous that one has to do considerable research in order, first, to relate thern to
each other, and, having so related them, to
understand and appreciate the language that

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Whether in the nature of
the case that must be so, is difficult for me
to say. In any case, there it is, and we have
to face it.
Instead of attempting a section-by-section
explanation of the bill, I propose to deal with
it under nine or ten different headings
covering its more important provisions. The
other provisions, which are of a technical
nature, are some of them consequential
upon amendments made to preceding sections. In some cases provision is made for
the purpose of correcting situations that
have occurred because of wrong interpretations of some sections of the, Act. When
this bill is given second reading it will be
all-important ft refer it to committee, because the only way in which we are going
to learn and appreciate just what is intended
by these amendments is to have them explained by the proper officials. We should
be able to ask them: "Why is it necessary
to enact this particular amendment? What
are the circumstances which give rise to
this amendment? Illustrate by example
what you are intending to cover here?" This
is the way we handled the bill last year, and
we had a verbatim report made in cornmittee which provided us with a useful
record of the scope, effect and intention of
the proposed amendments. Some of the
amendments which have crept into the bill
this year are the result of our previous
questioning of departmental officials in committee. So I hope that we shall follow the
same course in dealing with the amendments
in the bill now before us.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Having dealt in this
general way with the bill, may I now

to deal?
copies of the bill as passed by the House
of Commons, but as I had the bill in firstreading form when preparing this explanation, I propose for the sake of convenience
to refer to it in that form.
The first subject I wish to discuss is that
much maligned and confused item which, in
changed form, was introduced last year for
the first time-depreciation. When you
start to digest this item it seems a bit confusing, but actually the only change which
section 8, subsection 1 makes is to substitute the words "immediateiy before the
disposition" for the words "at the end of

SENATE
the year". This of course does not mean
very much in itself, but let me try to enlighten you. The basis for depreciation, socalled, is as follows. If you had an asset
with a depreciated value on January 1, 1949,
which was your starting point for an asset
that could be depreciated in law under the
new system of depreciation, then you were
entitled to certain rates of depreciation. If
subsequently you sold that property for
more than the original capital cost, the depreciation or some portion of it could be
recaptured. The theory was that during
the lifetime of the asset you were allowed
depreciation on the basis that the asset was
wasting away; but if ultimately you realized
the original capital cost, then you did not
need the depreciation, and in the year in
which you make the sale and gain, the
amount of the recapture goes into your income for that year. That was the general
law laid down last year, but it was found
that with the measuring stick being the
value of the depreciated property at the end
of the year, the law did not cover such a case
as the following. Supposing you had a number
of properties of a class entitled to be depreciated. At the end of the year there
might be a certain depreciated value in that
class, and six months later you might sell
one of these assets. In the meantime, however, you might have acquired two or three
other assets which were added to this class.
Now, as the law was constituted at the end
of last year, you did not get any benefit.
You were not able to apply the recapture
against the increased assets which you had
put into the class in the interval. May I
just illustrate by a simple example? Supposing the depreciable property, one of a
number of properties of this class that you
had, was sold for $50,000 in June of this
year. Then let us suppose that at the
beginning of this year you had an undepreciated capital cost of $40,000 in the whole
class, and half way through the year you
sell one of the assets within the class for
$50,000. Now, under the law the $10,000
gain would become part of your income and
be subject to income tax in that year. Then,
if in the first six months of this year you
had bought additional assets to a value of
$10,000 in that same class, then under the
amended section now proposed you would
not give up any part of that gain; in other
words you would not have to bring anything
additional into your income for the year.
The only effect would be that by applying the
gain against the additional assets brought in,
you would have fully amortized these additional assets at one time. You would not
add to your income or pay taxes for the
year in respect of this gain.

There was another situation which we discussed last year. Suppose a man has owned
and rented a house for a number of years and
depreciation is charged. If he then sells the
house at a profit, it is unfair that the total
amount of his gain should be recaptured
because of depreciation charged and that it
go into the year's income because, depending
on the circumstances in the country, the taxation rate in that particular year might be
greater than the rates extending over the
period of the years when he was charging off
depreciation annually, or in the year in which
he sold his property his income might be
higher, and this gain added to such income
might put him in a higher income bracket.
By another proposed amendment, in those
circumstances you may relate back to January 1, 1949, the amount of the gain. Thus, if
in 1951 you sell a property at a gain, you will
be able to spread the recapture resulting from
such gain back over 1951, 1950 and 1949. The
period over which the profit may be spread
is limited to five years, and in due time it
will be possible to spread over that maximum
period any gain that was realized in one year
through the sale of an asset a'nd the application of the recapture revision.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Has it got to be spread
evenly over the five years, or will it be permissible to apply larger amounts in one year
than in another?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think the provision
requires an even spread over the years. This
year the spread could be over only two years,
but in another three years it could be over
the maximum period of five years, in five
equal instalments.
It will be seen that the proposed amendment
in section 8, subsection 1, does not affect the
application of depreciation and the recapture
provision if the taxpayer is depreciating only
one capital asset. In order for a taxpayer to
benefit from this proposed amendment he
must have a number of depreciable assets in
a class. If he has only one asset, which, let
us say, he originally purchased for $50,000,
and he has depreciated it down to $40,000 and
sells it for $60,000, then the lesser of the two
amounts is what he is going to take back into
his income for the year. In this instance
which I have given the lesser of the two
amounts would be the difference between the
sale price and the original capital cost, or
only $10,000, whereas the difference between
the sale price and the depreciated value would
be $20,000. So the taxpayer would have to
bring into his income for the year $10,000, by
virtue of the other provision which I have
mentioned he would be able to spread that
recapture over a period of years. When we

MAY 25, 1950
got five years away from 1949 that period
would be, as I have pointed out, the maximum
one of five years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question? There is some
misunderstanding about this point, although
I do not think there should be. Suppose a
man bought a house for $10,000, which he
rented to a tenant. By the end of December
1948 or the lst of January 1949 he had depreciated it down to $6,000, and last year took
a depreciation of 10 per cent. That would
leave the depreciated value at $5,400. Then
he sells it for $9,000. As I understand it, he
pays income tax only on $600.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In the instance you have
given, of a property that cost $10,000, with a
depreciated value of $6,000 at the lst of January 1949 which property was later in the
year sold for $9,000, there would be no
recapture.
It will be remembered that last year there
was some agitation against having farmers
and fishermen made subject to the provisions
of this new type of legislation, and finally
they were exempted from these provisions.
It appears that in the meantime some of
them, or apparently enough of them to have
influenced the decision in another place,
decided that it might be in their interest to
have the new method of depreciation applicable to them. So we now have an amendment
which allows farmers and fishermen to elect
to take the benefit of the new system of
depreciation instead of continuing under
the old system. The only catch in it is that
once they elect to come under the new system
they must stay under it permanently and be
subject to all the detailed provisions of the
new system. In other words, the rates and
the recapture provision that are inherent in
this new system would, if they elected to
come under it, apply to them permanently.
All those proposed changes in relation to
depreciation are applicable to the year 1949
and subsequent years.
Another amendment has to do with what
are called profit sharing plans. A number of
companies have profit sharing plans for their
employees, and under each of these plans
a percentage of the corporation's profit is paid
in every year to a trustee, who operates the
The
plan for the benefit of the employees.
profits are allocated by the trustee to the
employees, but an employee may not be
entitled to receive his share of the profits so
allocated until he has served with the comIn
pany for a specified number of years.
some cases the minimum is ten years. Under
the present Act some difficulty developed, because the trustee was subject to tax on all the
money in his hands, and in some cases this

tax might be so heavy as seriously to affect the
operation of the plans. Amendments provided in the bill are intended to overcome
that difficulty. Paragraph (k) of subsection
2 of section 1 of the bill adds to the list of
amounts that must be included in an individual's income:
"amounts allocated to him in the year by a trustee
under an employees profit sharing plan as provided
by section 71A.

Any sum allocated within a year to an
employee, even though not payable to him
in that year, must be included as part of the
employee's income on which he pays tax for
that year. The purpose is to lessen the
burden of tax that would otherwise fall
upon the moneys in the trustee's hands for
that year. As to an employee who actually
receives a payment from a profit sharing plan
in any year, there is of course no question
that he must be taxed on it for that year. In
this respect, there is no change. The amendment affects the employee who simply has
money allocated to him in a year but is not
entitled to receive it until some later time,
perhaps some years hence. He will now
be required to pay tax on the amount allocated to him for the year in which it is
As I have already said, honourallocated.
able senators will find a definition of the
profit sharing plan in subsection 1 of section
27 of the bill. The new section 71A reads:
In this Act, an "employees profit sharing plan"
means an arrangement under which payments computed by reference to his profits from his business
are made by an employer to a trustee in trust for
the benefit of officers or employees of the employer
(whether or not payments are also made to the
trustees by the officers or employees) and under
which the trustee bas, since the commencement of
the plan or the end of 1949, whichever is the later,
each year allocated either contingently or absolutely
to individual officers or employees,
(a) all 'amounts received by him from the employer, and
(b) all profits from the trust property, . . .

Under those circumstances no tax is payable by the trust on its taxable income for the
period during which the trust was covered by
the employees' profit sharing plan. The tax
falls upon every employee to the extent of
the amount allocated to him, whether or not
it is paid to him in that year.
As I see this particular section the only
catch in it is this: If an employee, to whom
moneys were allocated were to quit before he
was entitled to have it paid to him, there is
no provision under which he may get credit
on subsequent taxes for the amount which he
bas paid on this income which is merely
deemed to be income for that year.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: And he will never
receive it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As it turns out, he will
never receive the money or any credit for the

SENATE
tax paid. The only explanation I can give is
that this is something new, and it does not
offer as generous treatment as, for instance,
is given for income tax purposes under a
pension plan.
This profit sharing arrangement does not
touch upon or affect a profit sharing plan that
is already part of a pension plan. It may be
that in the course of time some progress in this
connection will be made. I presume such
developments may come about when profit
sharing plans are extended, and consequently
a larger body of interested persons will be
capable of bringing greater pressure to bear in
order to support and protect the interests of
those affected. In the meantime, this proposal
marks a substantial beginning. As this provision in the essence is remedial, I am all for
it. My principle is to reach out and grab as
fast as you can anything that is remediýal,
particularly in income tax legislation, and
when you have gained a starting point, then
to get anything more that you can.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You must belong to a labour
union.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The next subject to which
I turn is that of charitable organizations and
charitable foundations. As there has been
considerable press comment on this feature of
the bill, honourable senators may be familiar
with it.
Section 57 of the present act deals in a
simple way with charitable organizations, and
provides that such organizations will, upon
conforming with certain conditions, be exempt
from taxation. This section of the Act, defines
a charitable organization as,
an organization operated exclusively for charitable
purposes or an agricultural organization, a board of
trade or a chamber of commerce, no part of the
income of which was payable to, or was otherwise
available for the personal benefit of, any proprietor,
member or shareholder thereof.

Section 21 of the bill gives a breakdown of
the paragraph which I have just read. The first
division has to do with argicultural and other
organizations. The second division is defined
by paragraph (ea) as,
a charitable organization, whether or not incorporated, all the resources of which were devoted to
charitable activities carried on by the organization
itself and no part of the income of which was payable to, or was otherwise available for the personal
benefit of, any proprietor, member or shareholder
thereof,

Paragraph (eb) of this section defines a
further division of the so-called charitable
organization, namely a foundation which does
not carry on any charitable work, but receives
money and accumulates earnings on money
which has been paid to it, and which it

disburses for the purpose of supporting a
charitable organization. This division of the
breakdown is defined as,
a corporation no part of the income of which was
payable to, or was otherwise available for the personal benefit of, any proprietor, member or shareholder thereof, that has not, since June 1, 1950,
acquired control (within the meaning of that expression as used in subsection (lA) of section 27) of
any other corporation and that, during the period,

The conditions are:
(i) did not carry on any business,
(ii) had no debts incurred since June 1, 1950,
other than obligations arising in respect of salaries,
rents and other current operating expenses, and
(iii) made gifts, the aggregate of which is not
less than 90 per cent of the corporation's income
for the period, to organizations in Canada the incomes of which for the period are exempt from tax
under this Part by virtue of paragraph (ea).

To summarize, a charitable organization
as defined by paragraph (ea) is an organization which itself carries on charitable work;
and, paragraph (eb) defines the type of corporation which carries on no business, has not
since June 1, 1950 acquired the control of
any company and has contributed at least
90 per cent of its income to charitable work,
as defined.
Such a charitable foundation is entitled to
tax exemption.

When section 21 was being considered in
the House of Commons the question was
asked: What happens when a charitable
foundation is presented with the controlling
shares of an operating company? As a result
the amendment, which is now subsection 3
to that section, was added. It provides the
exception to the provision that a charitable
foundation must not since June 1, 1950, have
acquired control of any company. The words
"acquired control" do not include a case
where a foundation has received a gift of
shares which may amount to control of the
company.
The only catch in the above
amendment, as I see it, is that one who
makes a gift of the controlling shares of a
company should tie to the gift some trust,
or understanding, as to the use and disposition
of the income. Failure to restrict the income in that way would result in the shares
becoming part of the income of the foundation
for that year, and therefore the foundation
would be under an obligation to distribute
thern up to 90 per cent of its income; otherwise, the organization would cease to have
the character of a foundation. As I see it,
failure to attach some qualification in these
circumstances as to the use of such shares
and the income from such controlling shares
of an operating company might have the
result of creating a situation whereby a
foundation could not hold such shares for
more than a year.

MAY 25. 1950
By subsection 4, subsection 1 of this section
is applicable to 1950 and subsequent years.
There has been expressed in the press some
concern as to whether or not community
chests and federated charities would be subject to these provisions. The best opinion
is that community chests and federated
charities are purely agents for charitable
organizations which are directly carrying
on charitable work. If they are put in
the category of agents which collect money
and pay it over to charitable organizations
who are directly engaged in such services,
they are not affected by these provisions.
Section 10 extends somewhat the existing
exemptions in respect of charitable gifts. It
will be seen that a taxpayer who makes donations to charitable organizations such as I
have described, either those that directly
carry on charitable works, or those in the
nature of foundations, is exempt from taxation to the extent, in the case of a corporation, of 5 per cent of its income for the year;
and in the case of an individual, of 10 per
cent of his income. An equivalent exemption
is provided for in respect of gifts to His
Majesty in right of the provinces and Canadian municipalities. If gifts are made to His
Majesty in right of Canada, the amount for
which exemption is allowed is unlimited. So
while exemption relating to gifts to provinces
,and municipalities is limited to 5 per cent
of corporation income and 10 per cent of individual income, one can be as generous as one
wants to be toward the federal treasury.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is there a definition of
"provinces"?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It says: "His Majesty in
right of the provinces".
Hon. Mr. Reid: Subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
refer particularly to corporations and to individuals.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: A corporation which
makes a contribution to a province or a Canadian municipality would receive exemption
up to 5 per cent of its income.
The next item I want to deal with is the
provision whereby, upon paying a tax of 15
per cent, a company that satisfies the definition of a "private company" under the Act
may deal with its undistributed income to the
end of the taxation year 1949, so as to provide what is termed under the act "tax-paid
undistributed income." I refer now to part
IA of the general provision for clearing the
accumulated undistributed income of a company known in law, under the definition here,
as a private company, for the period to the
end of the taxation year 1949. A "private
company" is defined in the act as being a

company which has not more than seventyfive shareholders. Section 32 of the bill adds a
new section 95A, which is part IA of the bill;
and it is provided that such private company,
if it elects to proceed hereunder, may clear
the undistributed income that it has on hand
to the end of the taxation year 1949, into taxpaid undistributed income by paying a 15
per cent tax to the federal treasury.
The second benefit conferred is that, to the
extent that such a company accumulates
undistributed income subsequent to the end
of the taxation year 1949, it may, by paying
15 per cent tax, also clear some portion of
that undistributed income; and it does so in
this way. Suppose that in-1951 the surplus
since 1949 is $200,000, it may then pay a
dividend of $100,000 and by making an election and remitting this tax of 15 per cent on
the balance of such undistributed income,
amounting to $100,000, the company may put
such balance less the tax in this select category of tax-paid undistributed income, and
by following certain machinery for distributtion provided for in the bill, no further tax
will be payable either by the company or the
recipients of the tax-paid undistributed
income on such distribution.
These are the two general ways in which
undistributed income is dealt with. Early in
the war years, as a result of the report of
the Ives Commission, a similar system was
instituted with some small differences in the
mechanics. By paying a tax which varied with
the amounts payable to the shareholders,
private companies were permitted to clear
out their undistributed income to the end of
1939. The provision now under consideration
brings this practice up to date, lays a pattern
for the future, and looks like very generous
treatment. But while Part IA prescribes how
the payment of the 15 per cent tax may be
made, it does not explain what happens when
it is paid. If, however, you follow through
the mechanics of the bill you will find that,
upon payment of the tax, a number of
methods are available whereby you can take
out that undistributed income which then
acquires the quality or character of taxpaid undistributed income. On a winding-up
one can take it out without payment of any
further tax. Or it can be taken out by means
of a stock dividend. Or one can create
redeemable preference shares and subsequently redeem those shares, and in that
way take out the money which has acquired
this tax-paid character. But one cannot pay
it out in cash: if it is so paid it is regarded
as a dividend and has all the characteristics
of a dividend, including that of income, and
is subject to tax.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does that apply to a stock
dividend?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, a stock dividend is
one of the methods you can employ to take
out such tax-paid undistributed income.
If on a winding-up you distribute any
undistributed income you are deemed to
receive a dividend under certain circumstances; and by subsection 2 of new section
73 of the Act you are also deemed to have
received a dividend if you redeem or acquire
any common shares at a time when a corporation has undistributed income on hand,
or if you convert any of the common shares
into shares other than common shares. Also,
by subsection 6, if a corporation has paid a
stock dividend the shareholders shall be
deemed to have received a dividend, and, by
virtue of the application of the general law
of income tax, you will have received someReverting to

subsection 4:

to the shareholders, other than by the direct
method of paying it out in cash by way of an
ordinary dividend.

Hon. Mr. McKeen: If a company has a
$200,000 earned surplus and pays the tax on
that surplus, putting it into capital, can the
company then cause a reduction of capital
and return the money to the shareholders as
a return of capital, without this money being
deemed income and being taxable as such?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is perfectly all
right. The result is the same whether you do
it by reduction of capital or by the so-called
redemption of preferred shares, or by the
winding-up or by stock dividends. You are
taking out of the company, the tax-paid
undistributed income, in a way which is
permitted under this section 73.
May I just say generally what happens in
the mechanics of carrying this into operation? When you elect to take the benefit of
this 15 per cent provision you may estimate

would have to be found to get the tax-paid As long as the income tax law has been in
undistributed income out of the company and force a door has been left wide open for the

MAY 25. 1950
disposition of what is called the undistributed
income or earned surplus of a company. For
instance, one company might make a deal to
buy all the shares of a second company, and
the second company might have a large
undistributed income. Having made that
deal and, acquired the shares, company No. 1
then causes company No. 2 to pay dividends
across to it, and these dividends being intercompany dividends corne across without tax.
That method has been followed often in the
financing of enterprises when companies are
in the process of getting together. Now, this
door bas been closed to some extent by the
section that now provides that if after May 10
you acquire the shares of another company
or corne into control of another company,
and you thereafter pass any dividends from
that controlled company to your own company, as the parent company, and those dividends are charged against the undistributed
income accumulated prior to the date on
which you acquired control, then those dividends become income. The cheapest. way in
which you can acquire them is by paying
the 15 per cent tax. As I see it at this date
there is this weakness in the legislation from
the point of view of the taxpayer. This provision has been in our law for a great many
years and it is not a realistic approach to
the situation suddenly to say that if you
acquire control of a company on or after
May 10 you are going to be charged with
incorne tax on the passage of the undistributed surplus that was built up by that
acquired company to the parent company.
For instance, I know of cases where transactions have been in the process of being
developed for a period of six to nine months
and the control has not actually been
acquired by this date; but as one of the
steps in the transaction the shares representing control are in the hands of a trustee.
This means in certain circumstances the
buyers have a right to acquire control. They
have not the control but they have the right
to acquire it, and I think there should be
some kind of provision to save existing
situations. In other words, there should not
be an absolute cut-off date. Naturally, if it
involves a question of policy it will be a
matter for the government to give an expression of opinion on it in committee stage, but
I regard it as my duty at this time to call
your attention to that phase of it, and the
effect it might have on people who have
bona ftde embarked on transactions and
committed themselves to purchases on the
understanding of what the existing law is.
Hon. Mr. Euler: To provide for the transition period.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, I think there should
be some transition period. For instance, if
55950-25

a deal has got to the stage where there is a
right to acquire control, I think that should
not be made subject to the new provisions.
Otherwise there might be an imposition of
very heavy burdens which were not contemplated by those who in good faith entered
into certain transactions. In some cases these
burdens might be so heavy as to make transactions entirely unprofitable, and had the
parties known of these burdens in advance
the deal would never have been made. I suggest that serious thought be given to this in
committee.
It gives me pleasure to speak about the
next amendment that I am going to mention.
The present Act and the old Income War Tax
Act gave the minister -authority to say to a
company at any ime, "In my opinion you have
accumulated a surplus in excess of your needs,
and I direct you to pay out $x within so many
days, or otherwise the amount will be
regarded as having been paid out as a dividend and the shareholders will be taxed as
though they had received it". Section 9 of
the present Act, which gives the minister that
authority, also provides a company which
can establish certain conditions may be
relieved from carrying out direction, if the
minister chooses to relieve it. Section 9 of
the Act is repealed by section 3 of the bill,
and although most of its provisions are
re-enacted as new section 73, the part giving
the minister .that-shall I say-arbitrary
power, is not re-enacted. It is gone, I hope
for ever.
Another point that I wish to mention is
that under the existing law stock dividends,
and even stock rights, are regarded as income.
Stock dividends were taxable as incorne in
the shareholder's hands, on the basis of the
value of the shares, whether at the time there
was any undistributed income, in the company
or not. But now there is added a provision
which makes it clear that stock rights are not
taxable as income. And as to stock dividends,
the taxpayer will only be regarded as having
received something that is capitalized and
paid out to him as income if there is an undistributed income in the company at the time
the stock dividend is declared. In these
circumstances, if the taxpayer has cleared
himself by the 15 per cent provision his stock
dividend is not regarded as income. So this
also is remedial and represents very satisfactory progress.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Where is that provided
in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is in sections 2 and
28.
I now corne to the section which I think
has been drafted as a result of the McCool
case. Honourable senators, particularly those

SENATE
of the legal profession, will be familiar with
that case, which went from the Exchequer
Court to the Supreme Court of Canada. I am
a little rusty as to the facts, but my recollection is that a gentleman by the name of
McCool incorporated a company, to which he
sold timber limits and other assets, and in
payment he took the company's notes, on
which the company paid interest to him. On
its income tax return the company deducted
as an expense the interest that it paid on these
notes. The deduction was not allowed by the
department, and the case was taken to the
Exchequer Court, which held that under the
present law this interest paid by the company
was not interest on borrowed money. On
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, that
decision was affirmed. It sounds almost as
reasonable as to say that a woman is not a
person. In any event, as the payments by the
company were held not to be interest on
borrowed money, they were not deductible as
an expense and were therefore taxable. Section 5 of the bill is designed to overcome the
problem presented by the law as interpreted
in the judgment in the MeCool case. Whether
it does so or not is something that I suppose
can be left to the test of time, but if the
department presents the amendment on that
understanding it will probably be interpreted
accordingly and it may not be necessary to
have a test in the courts.
Section 43 of the bill defines "death benefits". A death benefit for a taxation year is
defined as the amount that the widow or other
legal representative of an employee receives
in the year upon or after the death of the
employee, in recognition of his service to the
company. For purposes of taxation the death
benefit is subject to an exemption equalling
the amount of remuneration that the deceased
employee received frorn his employment for
the last ninety days before he died. And to
that degree the provision is remedial.
I have nearly finished my explanation. That
does not mean I have covered all the proposed
amendments. For instance, there are provisions for making easier the proof in court
of documents relating to proceedings under
the Act. There is also a lowering of the interest rate from 7 to 6 per cent, on gifts on
which the donor has failed to pay the tax and
on which the donor and the donee are severally liable for payment of the tax. By another
amendment the officers, clerks and employees of the Taxation Division of the Department of National Revenue are brought
under the provisions of the Civil Service Act.
These and ether amendments are important,
but they can be dealt with more readily in
committee than here. I have attempted only
a brief reference to the main features of
the bill, and as the measure will be examined

in committee I thought it unnecessary to
touch upon sections dealing with changes in
administration or procedure.
Undoubtedly much more light can be
thrown upon the various provisions of the bill.
I think we should be very careful to probe
into the proposed amendments fully, so that
when we are through with the bill we can feel
assured that we know all about it and understand why these changes in the law are
being made. We should ask in committee
why a certain thing is being done. We
should ask to have illustrated to us the many
ways in which this problem has come up and
why it should be dealt with in this or some
other way; and once we understand exactly
what the problern is, the question will be
whether this new legislation should be incorporated into our income tax law. If we
are satisfied, we should determine whether
the provisions are broad enough, and not too
broad, to correct the problem. I think we
will then be in a position to exercise our
judgment and say whether or not these
amendments should be made part of the Act.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I had intended to move the adjournment of
the debate, but as there are some delegations
waiting to be heard before the committee
tomorrow morning, I am going to ask a favour
of the house. If the chairman of the committee will consent, I would ask that the
delegations which are now here-and I understand there are some from Vancouver-be
heard tomorrow, and that further consideration of the bill be adjourned until about
Wednesday of next week. I ask this indulgence for the reason that I will be unavoidably
absent frorn Ottawa tomorrow.
As I have said previously, I think the
committee should have the departmental
officials present tomorrow, and that a shorthand report should be taken of the proceedings. A discussion of this topic is so valuable
that the record will be almost a text book, not
only for lawyers, but for bankers, accountants, businessmen, and farmers.
I am delighted with the explanation which
has been given this afternoon by the honourable senator frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden).
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And I should like to have
time to read and study his remarks. Some
of the members of the delegations to which
I refer have already been in Ottawa several

matter further. I therefore consent to the
bill being given second reading today, and
I would ask that at the conclusion of the
proceedings tomorrow the chairman of the

ELECTRICAL AND PHOTOMETRIC
UNITS BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READING POSTPONED
On the Order:
Second reading, Bill S-2, an Act respecting the
Units of Electrical and Photometric Measure.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators
I must again apologize to the house for being
unable to proceed with the second reading of
this bill. I assure the house that I am
familiar with its provisions and am prepared
to explain it this afternoon but for a technicality which has arisen. The bill refers to
a body called the National Research Council.
At the present time this body is sometimes
known as the Honorary Advisory Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research. By the
passage of Bill 179 of the House of Commons
statutory recognition will be given to the
National Research Council. I am advised by
the Law Clerk of the Senate that we cannot legally proceed to consider a body which
does not exist in law, and that we must wait
until Bill 179 is passed.
I ask, honourable senators, that the order
stand until Thursday next.
The order stands.
CRIMINAL CODE AND

CANADA

EVIDENCE BILL

SECOND READING
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved second reading
of Bill J-8, an Act to bring the Criminal Code
and the Canada Evidence Act into force in
Newfoundland.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is very clearly expressed in its
title. It is in fact a bill to bring the Criminal
Code of Canada and the Canada Evidence Act
into force in Newfoundland.
Honourable senators will remember that
the agreement of union betwen Canada and

Newfoundland came into effect on March 31,
1949. Subparagraph 2 of paragraph 18 of
that agreement provides as follows:
Statutes of the Parliament of Canada in force at

the date of Union, or any part thereof, shall come
into force in the province of Newfoundland

on a

day or days to be fixed by Act of the Parliament of
Canada or by proclamation of the Governor General
in Council issued from time to time ...
Honourable senators appreciate that at the
time of Confederation the criminal law which
existed in Newfoundland was, for the rnost
part, based on the criminal laws of England;
in fact, under the statutes then in existence
the criminal law of England of that particular time, was the criminal law of Newfoundland, except for any special criminal
statutes which the Legislature of Newfoundland passed from time to time.
When a new systern of criminal law is
being introduced into a country, obviously a
certain time must be allowed to elapse in
order that judges, magistrates, and court
officials can familiarize themselves with the
new law and new procedure. For that reason
a period of about fifteen months has been
allowed to elapse between the time of the
entry of Newfoundland into confederation
and the bringing of the criminal law of Canada into force in the new province.
It is of historical interest that in years past
when other provinces became part of Canada
similar bills were passed to bring the Criminal
Code and the Canada Evidence Act into
force in those provinces. For instance, I am
advised, that although British Columbia became a part of Canada in 1871, it was not
until 1874 that the Criminal Code of Canada
came into effect in that province; and it was
then brought into effect by a statute very
similar to the one we are considering this
afternoon.
In the bill before us there is nothing of any
great importance other than the general provision which I have referred to, and a provision for one or two transition cases, if I may
so call them. For instance, it is provided
that any offence committed before this bill
comes into effect in Newfoundland, and which
has not yet been adjudged, will continue to
be an offence and will be adjudged according
to the old law of Newfoundland, even though
this bill should come into force; and by
section 4, a warrant for the arrest of a person
issued under the old law which has not been
executed or completed before this new law
comes into force, will be effective.
That, I think, is a simple and complete
explanation of the measure. In view of its
relative simplicity, I do not know whether
honourable senators feel that the bill should
be sent for study to a standing committee.
I am quite willing to do whatever the house

SENATE

as the Governor in Council may determine.
There is no provision giving the Governor in
Council the power to extend the period for
re-verification beyond six years.
In order to re-verify a meter it is necessary
to remove it and take it to an inspection point
where its accuracy can be determined. This
necessitates replacing the meter for a certain
time with another meter. During the war it
was impossible for various reasons to carry

Hon. Mr. McKeen: Is it a fast or slow

Hon. Mr. Robertson: In some instances it
is fast.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Is there any provision
whereby a person may call for the inspection
of a meter if it has not been tested for six
years and he feels that it is working to his
disadvantage? I should imagine that when
the stamp is affixed to the meter it would
show the date of the last inspection, but
with just a receipt there would be no way
of knowing whether the meter had been
tested two years ago or ten. I would ask
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
if this bill is going to be referred to
committee?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As this bill involves
certain details with which, I am frank to
admit, I am not famillar, I intend to move
that it be referred to a committee where the
officials of the appropriate department will
be available to answer questions.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Then I shall not press
my questions.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is no doubt,
honourable senators, that this bill should go
to committee. To begin with, the principle
of the bill is not highly commendable. It proposes to allow longer delays than in the past
were thought wise. This may be legislation
just to take the place of energy, activity, and
attention to duties at hand. It may be.that
we will want to say to these people that
they had better get busy and do their jobs
rather than ask us to remove the obligation
from their shoulders. That is the way the
matter strikes me. I should like to have the
opportunity of asking the officials in charge
why it is that five years after the war they
are pleading the activities of the war as a
reason for not doing their work.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

GAS INSPECTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill L-8, an Act to amend
the Gas Inspection Act.
He said: Honourable senators, what I have
said about the principle of the Electricity
Inspection Bill also applies to this bill.
The Gas Inspection Act provides for the
inspection of gas meters, in the same way
that the Electricity Inspection Act provides
for the Inspection of electrie meters. The
reasons given for the backlog of work in
connection with gas are the same as those
given for the backlog of work in the inspection of electric meters. The same orders in
council extending the time limit for re-verification beyond six years for electric meters
are applicable to gas meters. Because of this
large backlog of work the government is
asking that the Act be amended to permit the
time limit to be extended by order in council,
and this would be accomplished by section 1
of this bill.
Section 2 of the bill provides for the issuing of a receipt, instead of the affixing of
stamps to the inspection certificate, as evidence of the payment of fees. I intend to
move that this bill be referred to committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would ask the honourable
leader if this has anything to do with the
reform of the House of Commons.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would suppose it
was within the constitutional powers of the
Senate to make certain that suôh would be
the case, and I would leave it to the advocacy
of the honourable senator to convince us on
that point.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps the padlock
law might apply in this instance.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My remarks about the
Electricity Inspection Bill apply equally to
the bill now before us, and which I presume
will be sent to committee, where an explanation may be given as to why these people
do not do their work.
The motion was ,agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS
Honourable
The Hon. the Speaker:
senators, a message has been received from
the House of Commons to return Bill 1, an
Act to amend the Criminal Code, and to
acquaint the Senate that they have passed
this bill with two amendments, to which they
desire the concurrence of the Senate.
When shall the amendments be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable members,
it is the practice of this bouse to delay the
consideration of amendments which come to
us from the other place until they have been
printed in our order paper. In this way
honourable senators have an opportunity of
studying them. The honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), who explained
this bill on the motion for second reading is
here today but will be absent from the
chamber tomorrow. With leave of the house,
I would ask that immediate consideration be
given to these amendments. I shall ask the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) to explain the amendments, and the
Government Whip, when the explanation has
been made, to move the adjournment of the
debate. The item will then stand on our
Order Paper, for the convenience of any
honourable senator who may wish to discuss
the amendments at some future date.
With leave of the Senate, I move that the
amendments be now considered.
The motion was agreed to.
The amendments were read by the Clerk
Assistant, as follows:
1. Page 3, lines 33 to 36: strike out .paragraph (f),
subclause (2), clause 9, and insert the following:
"(f) where in his opinion, supported by the evidence of at least one duly qualified medical practitioner, there is reason to believe that the accused
55950-26

person is mentally ill, order that the accused be
remanded in such custody as he directs for observation for a period not exceeding thirty days."
2. Page 7, line 21: strike out the word "May" and
insert "July."

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I now ask the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
to explain these amendments.
Honourable
Hon. Saller A. Hayden:
senators will recall that on the 21st of March
I gave an explanation of this bill to amend the
Criminal Code. It was subsequently considered in the other place, and two amendments were made. The first of the two
amendments which have just been read deals
with the case of an accused person who is
before a magistrate charged with the commission of an indictable offence and the
magistrate is in a position to proceed with
the preliminary hearing. The amendment as
passed in this chamber provided that if the
magistrate was of opinion that the accused
person was suffering from some mental illness,
he could adjourn the hearing for thirty days
and direct the observation of the accused in
that interval. The additional words inserted
by the other place are to the effect that the
magistrate's opinion must be supported by
the evidence of at least one duly qualified
medical practifioner. That seems to be a sound,
sensible precaution with which to surround
the exercise of his power: it is in the interests
of the accused and, I suppose, in the interests
of the state.
The second amendment merely changes the
date of coming in force of the amendments
from May lst to July lst. The earlier date
is now past; in fact the amendments were
considered in the other place subsequent to
May lst. To avoid the necessity of giving
retrospective effect to this bill, it is proposed
that it shall come into force on July 1 next.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am not exactly clear
on what is meant here, and perhaps the
honourable member from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) can inform me. Does the
magistrate still retain the right to adjourn
the hearing for the purpose of having the
accused examined by a medical practitioner,
who must give his certification before a
thirty-day adjournment may be granted?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If a magistrate were of
the .opinion that an accused person was
mentally ill, he could not, under the proposed
amendment, remand the accused for thirty
days for observation. He would probably
have to remand him for the usual seven days,
and during that period one duly qualified
medical practitioner would have to be found
to support the opinion of the magistrate as
to the mental illness of the accused. I take
it, too, that the medical practitioner would
actually have to go into the witness box in

SENATE

court to support the opinion of the magistrate.
Then the magistrate might remand the accused for thirty days, which would serve as
a period of observation to determine whether
or not the accused was in fact mentally ill.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien, the
debate was adjourned.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill

the privilege of saying a word about the
halibut fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean?
These are the greatest halibut fisheries in the
world, accounting as they do for some 90 per
cent of the world's total catch. The fishing is

done in four areas, which extend from
Seattle on the south, to Alaska on the north,
and about 200 miles out to sea. The halibut
was being depleted when, in 1923, a treaty
was signed between the United States and
Canada for the rehabilitation and preservation of the halibut fisheries. I may point out
that this treaty, which was signed by the
Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe, was the

first to be executed by Canada on her own
account. Prior to that time treaties had been
signed for Canada by Great Britain.
The total catch of halibut in the North
Pacific last year was a little more than 55

MAY 31, 1950
million pounds, of which Canada took about
20 million pounds. Canada is entitled to take
up to fifty per cent of the catch, but the
catch of the United States, which has large
boats for the open-sea fishing, is greater than
the Canadian catch.
The results of the treaty signed in 1923
show what can be accomplished when two
countries get together to preserve their fisheries. The treaty has operated successfully,
but recently it has been decided that certain
desired changes should be made by way of
a convention. The convention before us provides for reciprocal port privileges to the
halibut fishing vessels of Canada and the
United States on the Pacific coasts of each
country. These privileges enable the fishermen to land their catches of halibut and
sablefish without the payment of duties.
I should point out that "sablefish" is a term
which the Americans apply to black cod. In
halibut fishing the bait used is herring, and
large quantities of sablefish or black cod are
caught. These are not destroyed, but are
taken-as the law permits-to various ports
and sold.
Further, under the convention the fishermen, are permitted (a) to sell their halibut and
sablefish locally, on payment of the applicable
customs duty; (b) to transship them in bond
under customs supervision to any part of
either country, or (c) to sell them in bond for
export. In addition, they are enabled-subject to compliance with the applicable customs and navigation laws of either countryto obtain supplies, repairs and equipment.
For instance, American halibut fishing boats
may land at Canadian ports, and Canadian
boats may land at American ports, for the
purpose of taking on supplies or having
equipment repaired. These privileges, which
heretofore have been granted on an annual
basis by special legislation, will now be
available to the halibut fishermen of both
countries on a continuing basis.
Finally, the convention will alter the
present practice by extending the reciprocal
port privileges to Canadian halibut vessels
in ports of the United States proper. Up to
the present time these privileges have been
granted only in the ports of Alaska, and not
in ports south of the 49th Parallel. Under the
convention Canadian halibut vessels may go
south to Seattle or north to Alaska. The convention will continue for an indefinite time,
but can be terminated by either government
upon twelve months' notice.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, to any American port.
The motion was agreed to.
HOUSE OF COMMONS REFORM
MOTION WITHDRAWN

On the order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion of

affecting the House of Commons, including the
better functioning of the House of Commons in our
parliamentary system, with a view to formulating
proposals to be presented to the Government for
discussion at the forthcoming Dominion-Provincial

power to call for persons, papers and records; to
sit while the House is sitting and to report from
time to time; and that a Message be sent to the

with the Senate for the above purpose and to select,
if the House of Commons deems it advisable, some
of its members to act on the proposed Joint
Committee.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Stand.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, the honourable gentleman from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) was good
enough ta indicate ta me a day or two ago
that he would permit me ta take advantage
of this order which stands in his name ta
say a few words.
It is not difficult for me ta understand the
motives that prompted the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) ta move
this motion. It is probable that, as time
goes on, it may become desirable ta so
change our constitutional processes that parliament as a whole will be better equipped
ta
discharge its
responsibilities.
The
repeated suggestion that changes should be
confined ta the Senate of Canada, however,
so completely ignores desirable improvements which can be made elsewhere, that
anything which draws attention ta this fact
is in the nature of a public service.
The notice of motion which the honourable senator from Calgary has moved is, I
believe, in this category. There rests upon
the shoulders of the members of both Houses
of Parliament a continuing responsibility ta
equip themselves so that they may best serve
the interests of the people they represent.
I have no doubt that as time goes on the
members of both houses will realize their
responsibilities and act accordingly; and I
am sure that at the appropriate time the
whole subject will be approached by the
members of both houses in the serious manner which its importance warrants. There

knowledge of the constitutional development
of Canada should realize how unlikely it is
that the people of Canada would agree to a
single-chamber of parliament.
I must point out, however, that I am
bound at this time to take the same view of
the present motion as I took of the motion
of the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) last session, when
specifie proposals were made for reference to
last year's Dominion-Provincial Conference.
The conference now approaching is called to
consider ways and means of amending our
constitution, and I believe that at this time
it would be premature for this house to propose specific amendments for consideration.
I trust, therefore, that the honourable
senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) may
feel that the introduction of his motion bas
served a useful purpose in drawing attention
to the fact that desirable changes in our
constitutional processes are varied in their
nature, and that he may be willing to consider asking leave of the Senate to withdraw
his motion.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
as the honourable gentleman from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Ross) is absent from the chamber
because of illness, may I have permission of
the house to speak for him?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to allow the honourable senator from Provencher to speak for
the honourable senator from Calgary.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) requested

me to ask, on his behalf, for leave to withdraw this motion.
The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, is it your pleasure to consent to the
withdrawal of the motion of the honourable
senator from Calgary?
Some Hon. Senalors: Carried.

The motion was withdrawn.

ADDRESS
by
THE HONOURABLE LIAQUAT ALI KHAN
Prime Minister of Pakistan
to

MEMBERS 0F THE SENATE AND 0F THE HOUSE 01,' COMMONS
in the
HOUSE 0F COMMONS

CHAMBER, OTTAWA,

on
WEDNESDAY, MAY 31, 1950

The Prime Minister of Pakistan was welcomed by the Right Honourable Louis Stephen
St. Laurent, Prime Minister of Canada, and thanked by the Honourable Euie
Beauregard, Speaker of the Senate, and the Honourable William
Ross Macdonald, Speaker of the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Louis S. St. Laurent: Mr. Prime
Minister, Members of the Houses of Parliament: In welcoming you today, Sir, we wish
to pay a tribute to your great country, which
in so short a time has attained a place of
prominence in the world community; to, the
rank it holds in the concert of nations as an
active memnber of the United Nations and a
sister nation of the commonwealth; and last,
but not least, to the record of your personal
achievement as Prime Minister of Pakistan.
We, in turn, are honoured by your presence in this House of Commons. Naturally,
these words of greeting are addressed to you
on behaif of the whole population ot Canada;
but I find it particularly fitting that this
welcome be extended to you in our own
House of Commons, the -centre of the political
life of Canada and the very heart of our
democratic institutions. It is fitting indeed
that greetings from one democracy to another
originate in the House of Cormnons Chamber.
The accom'plish.ments of your country since
it began its separate political existence on
August 14, 1947, evoke sincere admiration.
Your countrymen had a long tradition of
history in the Asian sub-continent. Still it
is only less than three years ago-and what
are three years in the life of a nation-that
the Dominion of Pakistan came into being.
The astonishing progress made during such
,a short time augurs well for the future, and
p~u may rest assured, Sir, that we in this

country will watch your future achievements
with the same friendly interest we have had
in what has already been accomplished in
s0 short a time.
The future of Pakistan, notwithstanding
differences in religion and language, in customs and habits, notwithstanding lands and
oceans which separate it from Canada, is
closely related to our own through our common association in the United Nations, our
partnership in the Commonwealth and, most
of ail, in our common belief in those values
which form the very basis -of democratic
lite. We hope therefore that our association
will become dloser and dloser as we get to
know each other better. The exchange of
High Commissioners, between our two countries is but a first step in this direction.
At present Canadians are wont to associate
particularly the names of two men with
Pakistan: that of Mr. Mohammed Ali Jinnah,
who is regarded as the father of his country
and whose name has been immortalized by a
grateful people's use of the title "The Great
Leader", and your own, Mr. Prime Minister.
Mr. Jinnah, in creating a new nation, relied
heavily upon you, Mr. Liaquat Ai Khan,
whom. he described as his "right-hand man".
As his death occurred so soon atter the,
establishment of the independence of Paki-stan, there fell upon. your shoulders, Sir,.
the tremendous task ot giving substance to,
the blueprint, for building the machinery of.

SENATE

government in order that your nation might
effectively express the will of the Pakistan
people t'o contribute, through democratic
processes, to the welfare of mankind.
Monsieur le premier ministre, votre séjour
au Canada, si court soit-il, vous permettra,
je l'espère, de vous rendre compte de l'intérêt que nous portons à votre pays et à votre
population. A mesure que nos rapports se
feront plus fréquents et plus intimes, nous
comprendrons mieux nos problèmes réciproques et serons en mesure de leur trouver une
meilleure solution. Je tiens à vous assurer
que vous pouvez compter sur la compréhension et la bonne volonté du peuple canadien,
comme le Canada s'attend au même traitement de la part de vos citoyens.
In greeting you on this occasion, may I be
permitted, Mr. Prime Minister, to state how
happy we are that you are accompanied by
your charming wife. Her gentleness and
gracious manner almost belie the dominating
force which the Begum Liaquat Ali Khan is
known to exercise in organizing the woren
of Pakistan to meet the challenge of providing social security under most difficult circumstances.
On behalf of the Parliament and people of
Canada, I ask that the Honourable Liaquat
Ali Khan convey to the people of Pakistan,
on his return, our best wishes for their wellbeing and happiness, together with the assurances of deep friendship.
Members of the Houses of Parliament, I
present to you the Prime Minister of Pakistan.
Hon. Liaquat Ali Khan: Mr. Prime Minister,
Honourable Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr.
Speaker of the House of Commons, and
Members of the Canadian Parliament: In
permitting me to address you here today
within these walls, you have conferred upon
me great honour and privilege which I value
very highly and for which in the name of
my country and my nation I thank you.
As the recipient of this signal token of
your esteem my thoughts at this moment
turn to the struggle which made it possible
for our people to emerge as a free democratic
nation to take their rightful place amongst
the free nations of the world. For in
honouring me today you honour them, their
freedom, and the memory of that courageous
man who guided their footsteps towards the
goal of liberty. You will pardon me, therefore, if on this memorable occasion I am
reminded of the father of our nation and
the founder of our freedom, our Great Leader,
our Quaid-e-Azam, Mohammed Ali Jinnah
of revered memory, without whose vision,
determination and burning honesty, Pakistan
might have remained a vague longing and
a distant dream, and the reality, of which

my humble presence in your -august company today is but a symbol, might never have
been born. A sincere patriot, a passionate
follower of the democratic idea, a man who
saw farther and more clearly than his fellows, he led the Muslims of British India out
of their perplexities and frustrations into the
open air of freedom and gave shape, significance and direction to their quest for liberty.
All his life he fought for freedom, but since
he fought for the substance and not for the
shadow, for the thing and not for the word,
he let no illusions or catchphrases obscure
his penetrating insight or confound his grasp
of the essentials. He struggled long and hard
to forge the diverse peoples of his subcontinent into a mighty nation. But foremost
as he was in the ranks of those who fought
for independence, he was also the first to
perceive the inexorable logic of facts and,
when the time came, to proclaim fearlessly
that the people of British India, bound together though they were in their common
subjection, were not one, but two nations,
and that to relegate one hundred million
Muslims to the position of a perpetual political minority and to force the Hindu nation
and the Muslim nation into a single unwieldly state would be the negation of
democracy and would create the greatest
single unstable area in the world. The great
truth that he uttered was so startling in its
simplicity that for a long time even some of
his close friends and companions found it
stimulating, but strange. But the hundred
million suppressed Muslims knew instinctively that what he said merely gave coherence and dynamism to their own hesitant,
inarticulate feelings. When on the 14th of
August, 1947, our flag was unfurled in
Karachi, a nation of eighty million people
thanked God that the Quaid-e-Azam had
lived to see his dream come true. And
when he left us to rest in God, to whose
greater glory he had dedicated himself, we
knew that he had bequeathed to us a great
destiny to fulfil. Wherever the flag of Pakistan may fly, its capital shall always be that
hallowed piece of earth where he lies buried.
The three years that have elapsed brought
with them many a trial that we expected and
many others that we did not. The mass
migration that took place between our country and our neighbour, and caused much
unhappiness to people on either side of the
border, was a great shock to our economy
and a great strain on our administrative machinery which, it will be recalled, had had to
be set up within a period of two months for
a population of eighty million and for a
territory that was spread far and wide. But

MAY 31, 1950
our experiences, whether grave or stimulating, only convinced us that the historie decision that the Muslims of British India had
taken, to work for a state of their own, was
eminently justified. What is more, the events
of these early years and the manner in which
the people of Pakistan faced them have
filled us with hope and confidence for the
future. It was not the maturity of our administration or any previous experience or
preparation that helped us to tide over the
almost insurmountable difficulties that appeared in our way. Experience or preparedness we had none, for there had been no
time for these. It was the fortitude and the
determination and the self-sacrifice of the
common man and woman which came to our
rescue and gave our young state a momentum which will not be easily exhausted and
which we believe will grow in strength. No
new state could have been launched on its
career under greater handicaps. But these
three years of struggle have made us a wiser
and more unified nation than we could have
otherwise hoped to become within such a
short time. Although they demanded great
courage, patience and vigilance, they have
endeared our freedom to us even more- and
have shown to us very clearly the path to a
bright future.
To what use do the Muslims who form the
majority of the people of Pakistan propose to
put their freedom? This is a question which
we as a nation have pointedly asked ourselves
and to which we have a clear and unhesitating
answer.
Firstly, we are determined that the Muslims
in our state shall be enabled to order their
lives in accordance with their faith, that at
the same time our minorities shall enjoy
full rights of citizenship and shall freely
profess and practise their religions and
develop their cultures, and that their legitimate interests and the interests of the backward and depressed classes shall be adequately
safeguarded.
Secondly, we are pleclged to the principles
of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and
social justice as enunciated by Islam. This
does not mean theocracy, for Islam does not
believe either in priesthood or in the caste
system. On the contrary our conception of
democracy is possibly even more comprehensive than that which is contained in the
institutions of universal franchise and majority rule, for it embraces social and economie
justice, the right of private ownership, of
each individual to enjoy the fruit of his
honest labour-and yet with laws and institutions designed to eliminate destitution and
to place healthy checks on vast accumulations
of unearned wealth.

All this we call the Islamic way of life and
pursue it because as Muslims we could not
follow any other ideology or seek guidance
from any other source but God, whose injunetions we believe these to be. To abandon
these principles would be for us to destroy
instead of create what we hope to build up,
and for which we demanded independence
and freedom and a separate State.
Thirdly, we are resolved ito safeguard our
freedom at all costs, whatever the threat and
whatever the quarter from which aggression
may face us. For our own part we have
no aggressive designs and consider it our
moral responsibility to pursue the path of
peace and to help in the maintainance of
peace and stability everywhere, particularly
in the uneasy continent of Asia, on whose
future, according to our way of thinking,
world peace very largely depends. Nowwhere in Asia are the circumstances for the
development of the democratic idea more
naturally favourable than they are in Pakistan, for nowhere are people more unified and
more determined to apply their moral concepts of equality and social and economic
justice to promote human welfare and to
resist any attempt to tamper with their
beliefs. But democracy, in Pakistan or elsewhere, is of little use to the common man
unless its advantages are made available to
him in his daily life and his standard of
living is raised at least to a level which gives
him a substantial stake in the way of life
which he has chosen for himself.
We are fully conscious of this, and consider it our foremost duty to develop the
resources of our country at the greatest possible speed. Even in the days of our greatest anxieties we were able to go ahead with
this task, and though much remains to be
done we are glad that we have been able
to revive our trade, to plan the development
of our irrigation, the expansion and modernization of our agriculture and the utilization of our power resources, to keep our
budgets balanced and to throw the gates
wide open to private enterprise in our industrial development. For this task there is
nothing more essential to us and nothing
that we could or do desire more passionately
than peace.
I know that in Canada I am amongst
friends and speaking to people who are in the
same family circle as Pakistan. I feel therefore than I can speak somewhat more intimately than is perhaps usual on formal
occasions.
Your great country and our
young state both belong to the Commonwealth of Nations. I am not one of those
who would demand that the bond which
exists between the various members of the

SENATE

commonwealth be minutely defined. It is
enough for me to know that they all basically have the same constitution, even though
one of them may be a monarchy and another
a republic, and that all subscribe to the
common principles of democracy, freedom
and peace. In the uneasy apprehensive
world of today such a large group of nations
with so much identity in their declared aims
should lhe a heartening spectacle to mankind. No practical 'person would therefore
wish wantonly for its disintegration. Two
facts, however, I would humbly and respectfully commend to your attention.
First,
that with the growth of three Asiatic members of the commonwealth to the status of
dominions, the notion that the commonwealth
ties are mainly religious, historical or racial
must be regarded as having outlived its
use. If the commonwealth does nothing
more than give the world a lead in establishing the brotherhood of man, irrespective of
race, creed or colour, it will still have made
a notable contribution to the cause of
human welfare.
Second, that since the
greatest fear of the world is the fear of
war, under whose shadow progress alters
its aims and millions of humble men and
women wait helplessly and apprehensively
for an undeserved doom, the Commonwealth
has great opportunities for raising the
hopes of mankind by outlawing war and
aggression and the use of coercion or force
as a method of settling disputes amongst
its own members. We sincerely believe that
in this way this free association of free
nations could set the world an inspiring
example and give greater reality and efficacy
not only to itself but also to the charter
of the United Nations, to whose aims we
are all pledged and whose success we all
pray for.
The ideals of a freedom-loving democracy
in a young and underdeveloped country
such as ours could be epitomized in three
words-peace, progress and co-operation.
These three are but aspects of the same
fundamental urge: for there can be no progress without peace, no peace without progress and the removal of the economic
disequilibrium, so apparent in Asia, which
keeps more than half the world in poverty
and the ferment of discontent, or without
international co-operation, which we believe
to be the greatest need of all countries, great
and small. In the pursuit of democratic
ideals few countries have shown greater
sincerity of purpose and a higher quality of
quiet determination than yours. Blessed with
the wealth of natural resources, you have
shown the world how a nation, by dint of
hard work, by its unity, its sturdy moral

qualities, its progressive yet modest outlook,
its wide international sympathies and its
neighbourliness, can raise itself to great
heights, bringing happiness to many and fear
to none among those who love peace and
honour the freedom of others as they do
their own. I am sure that we can look
forward to a long period of friendship
between our two countries, and that in any
joint moral undertaking to promote the welfare of mankind and good will and ipeace
amongst nations, Pakistan and Canada will
be more than friends. God bless your country and its people.
(Translation):
Hon. Elie Beauregard: Your Excellency, the
Upper Chamber and the French-speaking
people, on whose behalf I am now speaking,
are pleased to welcome both yourself and
your charming wife and collaborator, and
to thank you for the friendly visit you have
paid the Canadian Parliament as well as for
the substantial speech you have delivered. In
you we greet a distinguished representative
of a commonwealth nation which, in addition,
is one of the world's great countries.
By its spiritual unity, based on the teachings and tradition of Islam, the sovereign
s'tate of Pakistan binds two territories that,
oddly enough, are divided geographically.
This thousand year old bond, of which religion and culture are the warp and woof, you
recognize as stronger, as more imperious than

that of mere neighbourhood or of the continuation of the land.
Pakistan's evolution provides one of the
most interesting chapters of world history. In
a sort of prophetic vision, your great poet
Iqbal foresaw the development which you
have made it your mission to achieve.
Under your leadership, your country, which
throughout the ages has known and absorbed
many civilizations, has tprogressed rapidly in
the economic field. Though this is somewhat
contrary to our conception of a legend:ary and
static Orient, we can but rejoice at its march
towards progress and a better standard of
living, benefits which are common to all true
democracies.
Following in the footsteps of the illustrious
Mohammed Ali Jinnah, you recognize, as the
leader of your country, that your authority
comes to you from the people. You have
desired to establish your country's constitution on a democratic basis and to complete
its independence by making its policy as one
with its ideals.
Through your character and your culture,
as well as through the exigencies of our time,
you are enabled to understand to the full
what democracy really means. You know that

MAY 31, 1950
a strong nation is one in which the several
units are made responsible for national
development, by being called upon to participate in the administration of public affairs.
Your industrial and social program is commensurate with your overflowing personality.
You are extending in the economic sphere the
reform accomplished in the political field.
Without breaking your age-long traditions,
you are leading your people to the development of natural resources, industry and world
trade. Pakistan will thus be a democratic,
industrial and prosperous country.
May we, Excellency, greet in you the great
architect of this national revival and offer
you a tribute of admiration and the expression of our best wishes.
(Text):
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald (Speaker of the
House of Commons): Honourable members of
the Senate and of the House of Commons:
From time to time our parliament has been
honoured by visits from internationally
known statesmen. Once again this honour has
come to us. Today we have had the privilege
of receiving the Prime Minister of a new
nation which has been formed by people of
ancient lineage and great traditions. The
history of our country is very short compared
to that of the country of our distinguished
visitor, but we are a few years older in the
status of nationhood. We are both young
nations. I am sure we were all very much
pleased to hear our Prime Minister say that
we are sister nations; and then, shortly after,
we were happy indeed to hear our distinguished visitor say that we belong to the sane
family circle.

Pakistan and Canada have many things in
common. Allow me to mention but one.
Both countries are bordered by powerful
nations which speak the same or a similar
language, and which have the same customs
and traditions. Canada has lived in peace
with her powerful neighbour for nearly 150
years. I am sure that I speak for all our
members when I say that we hope our
younger sister Pakistan, will enjoy with her
neighbour the same peaceful relations as her
elder sister, Canada, has enjoyed with her
neighbour.
Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, may I express to
you our admiration for the statesmanship
which has already been demonstrated by you
in facing the problems which have confronted
you. We are deeply impressed by the high
morale of your people and their faith in the
belief that their new status as a sovereign
independent nation will gradually bring to
them a better way of life.
Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, on behalf of the
members of the Canadian House of Commons, I extend to you our deep appreciation
for your very informative and inspiring
address this afternoon. Our Prime Minister
has asked you to convey a message to all of
your people. May I, as Speaker of the House
of Commons, ask you upon your return to
Pakistan to carry our greetings to your constituent assembly, and to tell your members
how happy Canadians were today to have in
their Houses of Parliament the Prime
Minister of Pakistan.

THE SENATE

WAR VETERANS' ALLOWANCE BILL
FIRST READING

Thursday, June 1, 1950
The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, before we proceed with the business
on the order paper, I should like to make a
brief statement with respect to various matters
which are to come before the house. In a few
minutes a message will be received from the
other place with a bill to amend the War
Veterans Act. I should like to proceed with
consideration of this bill, because, as I am
told, it deals with payments of benefits, it
would be of advantage to have it passed in
time to receive Royal Assent today. If, however, when I have explained this measure,
any honourable senator desires further
information about it, I will not press for its
passage toCay, but will postpone the second
reading until next week.
I am going to ask that second reading be
given to -the Supply bill, which is the first item
on the order paper. I should also like to proceed with consideration of the amendments
made by the House of Commons to Bill I, an
Act to amend the Criminal Code. This is
the second item on the order paper. We could
also deal with item 3, the second reading of
Bill 179, an Act to amend the Research Council
Act; and if approval is granted, perhalps the
bill could receive third reading. I am informed that this .would assist in the organization of the National Research Council. Some
of the remaining items I propose to stand over
until tomorrow, and others until the first of
next week. This will give the Standing
Committee on Finance a better opportunity
to consider the estimates, which were before
it this morning. In order to facilitate this
procedure, the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) has indicated his
willingness to let his motion stand until next
week.
Next Tuesday morning the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce will again
meet to consider the Income Tax Bill, and
tomorrow afternoon I intend to introduce a
bill to amend the Shipping Act. This will
involve considerable discussion. Next Monday
night I hope to ýproceed with the bills to amend
the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, and the Foreign Insurance Companies
Act.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 180, an Act to amend the
War Veterans' Allowance Act, 1946.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, I move the second reading now.
This bill, which has been distributed to
honourable senators, is entitled an Act to
amend the War Veterans' Allowance Act,
1946. The purpose of the bill is twofold.
First, it would increase the number of persons eligible for war veterans' allowances;
and second, it would decentralize the administration of the Act.
The bill proposes to make eligible for
allowances certain war veterans who did not
serve with the Canadian forces but who are
now resident in Canada. It would apply to
all persons who have been resident in Canada
for twenty years and who served with an
ally in any of the wars in which Canada
participated before August 31, 1921. These
wars are the Riel Rebellion, the Boer War
and World War I.
It will be remembered that in the 20's
there was a ten-year period of vigorous
immigration of people to Canada from variOus countries that had been allied with us in
war. A large percentage of these persons
served during war in the armies of the countries of their origin. They have lived in this
country for many years and consider themselves Canadians. The best estimate that
can be obtained at present is that because
of this amendment approximately 3,000 persons will be added to our veterans' allowance
rolls, and that the additional cost incurred
will be about $2 million annually. This
would mean that for the year 1950-51 the
total veterans' allowance payments will be
nearly $25 million. It is also reasonable to
assume that in the next fifteen years another
1,500 persons will become eligible for payments. Needless to say, that estimate refers
not to persons added because of this particular bill, but to the class of veterans as a
whole. There are now approximately 33,000
veterans receiving allowances under the Act.
The new provisions would take effect as
of April 1, 1950. The War Veterans' Allowance Board is now prepared to give immediate attention to new applications. In the
last few years the work of the board has
increased greatly, and it is difficult for this

JUNE 1, 1950
centralized body to do the work without
incurring some delay. Therefore it is proposed by the second part of the bill to create
district war veterans' allowance authorities,
which would have power to grant, suspend,
increase or decrease allowances. Awards by
district authorities would be subject to
review by the central board, which would
also act as a board of appeal and supervise
the practice of the local authorities.
I may say that in the general discussion
which took place on this bill elsewhere, some
question arose as to the reason for the
specific understanding that the bill applied
to veterans of such wiars as the Riel Rebellion, the Boer War and World War I. A
moment's contemplation would indicate that
at this date there are not likely to be many
applications from persons who served in
either the Riel Rebellion or the Boer War.
Nevertheless, it is necessary and desirable
that such persons should not be excluded.
I think the criticism of the bill in the other
place was, largely, that it did not go far
enough, some members feeling that the residence qualification of twenty years should
have been shortened.
I shall now deal with the bill section by
section. Honourable senators will observe
that, by section 1, veterans of His Majesty's
forces raised in Newfoundland are assured
of the same treatment as that received by
veterans of the Canadian forces.
Section 2 makes eligible for benefits veterans of His Majesty's forces other than
Canadian and veterans of the forces of allies
of Canada who served in a war in which
Canada participated prior to August 31, 1921,
and who have lived in Canada for at least
twenty years.
By section 3, persons who served during
World War II in the forces of Canada and also
served during World War I in the forces of
an ally, become eligile for benefits.
Section 4 would make ineligible any persons
who served in the forces of the enemy during
World War II.
Under the provisions of the Pension Act, a
person who is helpless and requires an
attendant may receive an additional payment
of from $480 to $1,400 per annum. The War
Veterans' Allowance Act provides that no
deductions shall be made from any allowance
by reason of such payment, and section 5 of
the bill extends this protection to any veteran
who is receiving such payment from the
country in whose forces he served.
Section 6 would add Part V to the Act for
the purpose of effecting a decentralization in
administration. Subsection (1) of the new
section 31 gives the minister power to establish regional districts and to appoint district

authorities to administer them. Subsection
(2) of this section gives the district authority,
within his area, all the powers which are now
exercised by the central board. Under subsection (3), all applications for allowances
must be made in the first instance to the
district authority concerned.
Subsection (1) of the new section 32 spells
out the powers of the district authority. Under
subsection (2) appeals may be taken from the
district authority to the central board.
The new section 33 permits the minister, on
approval of the Governor in Council, to make
certain regulations affecting the district
authorities in regard to (a) the quorum of a
district authority; (b) the procedure in
matters before a district authority; and (c)
the procedure on appeals to the central board.
Section 7 of the bill repeals section 50 of
the Statute Law Amendment (Newfoundland
Act), the provisions of which are embodied
in section 1 of the bill.
By section 8 payments to be made to the
new classes of veterans will commence April
1, 1950.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Has the honourable
leader any information as to the number of
pensioners who served in the Riel Rebellion?
That rebellion occurred some sixty-five years
ago, and anyone eligible in that class would
now be an octogenarian.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No. I believe that in
answer to a similar question the minister
stated that, though he had no accurate
information on the point, it was highly
improbable that there are any persons who
can qualify as applicants. It is true that
some veterans of the United States Civil War
are still alive, although their number is very
small. So, too, it is possible that there are
a few survivors of the Rebellion.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Very few.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In all probability,
very few. But if there are any, the intention
is that they shall not be excluded.
Hon. Thomas Reid: This is a very important measure. It has been brought into being,
I believe, through the operation of two
important factors: first, that it has long been
advocated by the Imperial veterans, consisting of ex-service men from Great Britain;
and second, through the entry of Newfoundland into confederation. It will be gladly
received by certain sections of the Canadian
people, especially Imperial veterans.
I have two questions to put to the government leader. I have in mind the case of an
Italian, but the principle applies, of course,
to other nationalities. This man served in

NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES
CONVENTION
MOTION FOR APPROVAL
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament do approve the ratification, without reservation, of the International Convention for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, signed in Washington on
February 8, 1949, but subject to the observation that
ratification by Canada of the convention extends to
Newfoundland and that any claims Canada may
have in regard to the limits of territorial waters or

to the jurisdiction over fisheries, particularly as a
result of the entry of Newfoundland into confedera-

tion, will not be prejudiced, and that this bouse
do approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
thé honourable member from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) to handle this motion.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
throughout my public service as an elected
representative I have always been largely
supported by fishermen and those associated
with the fishing industry. I therefore have
an abiding interest in their welfare, and so
welcome the resolution which is now before
the bouse.
I feel that the adoption of this, motion
will open the way for further conservation
and development of the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries. This convention involves many
countries all of which, I feel will benefit;
and I am sure we are all agreed that the
conservation of the food products of the
sea should be beneficial to all mankind. I
trust that great and lasting value will come
to Canada from this resolution, and I knàw
that it will prove particularly beneficial to
the Maritime Provinces.
The motion deals with a difficult and
troublesome problem. Effective control and
authority can only be established by agreement between the nations interested in the
fisheries of this convention area, each exereising authority in an agreed and similar
manner.
The conference at which this convention
was signed was called at the invitation of
President Truman of the United States, and
was attended by plenipotentiary delegates
from Canada, Denmark, France, Spain, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Newfoundland, Portugal,
the United Kingdom and the United States.
Delegates of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the
International Council for Exploration of the
Sea accepted an invitation to attend as

observers. The conference met in Washington,
D.C., on January 26, 1949, and the agreement
was signed there on February 8, 1949.
The foreword to the agreement is as follow:
The governments, whose duly authorized representatives have subscribed hereto, sharing a substantial interest in the conservation of the fishery

resources of the N'orthwest Atlantic Ocean, have
resolved to conclude a convention for the investigation, protection and conservation of the fisheries of
the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, in order to make
possible the maintenance of a maximum sustained
catch from those fisheries ...

Article I of the convention defines the convention area, which is generally considered to
be the fishing area of the Northwest Atlantic
Ocean. The definition is a rather technical
one, giving longitudes and latitudes, and it
would be difficult for me to explain it except
in a general way. The area in question
commences at a point on the coast of Rhode
Island and reaches into the sea, spreading
to the waters on the northwest side of Greenland. This area is divided into five sub-areas,
which are designated in the annex to the
agreement. For your general information I
may say that the first sub-area is off the
west coast of Greenland, which is a
dependency of Denmark; the second is off the
coast of Labrador; the third includes the
Newfoundland and Grand Banks area; the
fourth runs from Cape Ray, Newfoundland,
along the Canadian coast to the American
border; and the fifth is wholly off the coast
of the United States. I have here an official
map showing the division of the area affected,
and if any honourable senator wishes to get
a better idea of the five sub-areas he may
have access to this map.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The convention area includes all the waters in which Newfoundland and eastern Canadian fishermen operate.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes. The whole area
is generally know as the northwest Atlantic
Fisheries area, and nothing in the convention
shall be deemed to affect adversely the
claims of any contracting government in
regard to the limits of territorial waters
or to the jurisdiction of a .coastal state over
fisheries.
The convention provides for the establishment of a commission on which all signatory
countries are represented. Each contracting
government ma-y have as many as three commissioners, but no government will have
more than one vote. Decisions of the commission are to be taken by a two-thirds
majority of votes. Sepprate panels for each of
the sub-areas will be established and maintained in order to carry out the objectives
of the convention. Under this ingenious
system there can be independence of action
by the countries most vitally affected.

SENATE
The function of the commission is to collect,
collate and disseminate scientific information,
and to act jointly for development and preservation in the area. The commission has
no regulatory powers, but it or any of its
panels may make recommendations to the
depository government, which is the government of the United States. The permanent
seat of the commission will be in North
America-which means in either the United
States or C-anada-at a place to be selected
by the commission, and the depository government shall inform all signatory governments and all adhering governments of ratifications deposited and adherences received.
The convention will come into force when
four signatories have .ratified it. Great
Britain, Iceland and the United States have
already signed; and if Canada ratifies without reservation, the convention will be established.
Article VIII of the convention deals
specifically with conservation. This has long
been a matter of concern to the people of the
Maritime Provinces, and is a live question at
the present time. While many nations share
in the fisheries of this area, preservation is of
vital importance, especially to Canada. The
ocean is international, and ,at present there
is no international jurisdiction over fishing
in general on the high seaýs. It appears to me
that by the use of this convention, especially
through its panels, vitally interested governments may be able to achieve a joint jurisdiction that will have a practical result in
conserving the fishing areas. There are now
certain international rules of navigation,
which have been adopted by Canada in common with most nations using the sea. These
rules are to be found in the International
Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, and
a number of them are re-stated in the Canada
Shipping Act. But, as I have said, there are
no general rules governing fishing on the high
seas. It might be said that before the fish
are caught they belong to no one-or to anyone, as you like-and that they become
someone's property only iafter being caught.
As the conference that adopted the convention met at Washington in February 1949,
which was ýprior ito the union of Newfoundland with Canada, Newfoundland was represented there by a separate delegation. The
delegates were the president of the is'land's
Fish Board and an associaite. With permission of honourable members I will quote
from a statement which, because of its source,
I take to be official. * Speaking in another
place the Parliamentary Assistant to the
Minister of Fisheries said:
At the Washington conference which adopted the
convention, Newfoundland was represented by a
separate delegation, and the convention was signed

"for His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Newfoundland in
The United Kingdom

ratifies this convention an observation will be

attached to our instrument of ratification, making

clear that the ratification covers Newfoundland, and
pointing out that the provision in the convention
safeguarding any claims to territorial waters bas
taken a broader meaning as far as the Canadian

government is concerned since Newfoundland bas

been united with Canada. This observation will
therefore assert that the Canadian ratification is on
the basis that the provision referred to above
entirely protects all claims to territorial waters and
jurisdiction over fisheries, particularly as a result
of the alteration in the Canadian boundaries that
bas taken place by the joining of the tenth province.

In the primary arrangements Canada was
formerly represented on the panel of three
of the sub-areas, but now that Newfoundland is a part of this -country we shall be
represented on four of the five sub-area
panels. The sub-areas are defined in the

annex to the agreement.
arrangements for the functioning of this convention are in the hands of the American government, upon whom falls the duty of .calling
the convention together. Membership on the
panels is subject to change by the commission
every two years, and the representation
accorded to each of the various sub-areas will
be determined largely by its production and its
proximity to the area of a signatory country.
The Commission is required to hold a regular annual meeting. Other meetings may be
called by the chairman, upon the request of a
commissioner of a contracting government,
subject to the concurrence of two others, one
of whom must be the commissioner of a government on the North American continent.
Each government has one vote in the commission and on separate panels, and decisions
will be made on a two-thirds majority of all
contracting governments. However, under
article VIII, proposals from any panel for
regulatory provisions will require the unanimous consent of contracting governments
participating in the panel, or panels, to which
the proposals apply. After any proposal bas
been adopted and in force for a year, any
contracting government may terminate its
acceptance

of

it,

and in

that event,

since

unanimous consent is needed, the proposal
would no longer be in effect.
The cost of the commission for the first
year is expected to be in the region of
$40,000. This estimate is based on the present
expenditure of the International Council for
Exploration of the Seas. This cost will be
met by an assessment of $500 on every participating country, plus an extra fee for
representation on panels.

JUNE 1, 1950
There are provisions whereby after ten
years any government, upon giving proper
notice, may withdraw from the commission.
There is provision for the setting up of
advisory committees, to be composed of fgîhermen, vessel-owners and other persons who
are well informed as to the problems of the
fisheries of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.
In the final act of consummation of the
convention,
Canada
received prominent
mention. In this respect the conference report contains the following conclusion:
The need for thorough consideration of the problems facing the commission is paramount, and considerable time will be needed for assembling the
material required for a determination of those problems. An informal interim committee of biologists
might well be asked to assemble such material in
advance of the coming into effect of the convention,
and the Government of Canada might take the
initial measures to this end.
Article IV provides for the setting up of a
panel for each sub-area, and those most interested can work together efficiently and independently. For instance, in Sub-area 5, which
is wholly off the coast of the United
States, Canada
and the United States
compose the panel. If the commission rejects
a recommendation sent to it by a panel, it
must be returned to the panel; but when the
recommendation is sent forward a second time
it must then be forwarded to the depository
government, which is the government of
United States. If the members of the panel
agree to the recommendation, it prevails notwithstanding the objection by certain members of the commission. This has the effect
of giving local control in a sub-area. Though
the commission regulates the whole convention
area, each panel can' make recommendations
which may become effective in its own subarea.
Hon. Mr. Petten: May I ask the honourable
gentleman what countries are included in
panels 2, 3 and 4?
Hon. Mr. Kinley:

The answer to my hon-

ourable friend's question is to be found in the
annex to the convention, which reads as
follows:
For a period of two years from the date of entry
into force of this convention, panel representation
for each sub-area shall be as follows:
(a) Sub-area 1-Denmark, France, Italy, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom;
(b) Sub-area 2-Denmark, France, Italy, Newfoundland;
(c) Sub-area 3-Canada, Denmark, France, Italy,
Newfoundland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom;

(d) Sub-area 4-Canada, France, Italy, Newfoundland, Portugal, Spain, United States;
(e) Sub-area 5-Canada, United States;
By Article VIII the contracting governments
agree to call the attention of the commission
to the fact that non-member nations may not

be complying with the regulations in the convention area. France and Spain requested
from the conference a definition as to coastal
limits and territorial waters. The conference
did not meet their request, considering that
any discussion on this matter would lead to
a definition of territorial waters, and this
matter was formally declared by the conference to be out of its competence. While
France and Spain yielded, they did not agree
to paragraph 2 of Article I. In this regard
the Italian delegation did not vote, because
it had no instructions from its principals.
I think, honourable senators, the keen interest on the part of the United States in this
convention should have a salutary effect, and
will be all to the good as far as Canada is
concerned.

I may be permitted to read an

extract from the address of Dr. W. M.
Chapman, Chairman of the Commission, when
he announced the policy of the United States
with regard to high seas fisheries before the
State Chamber of Commerce at San Francisco,
on March 29, 1948. These are his words:
Canada and the United States by mutual sacrifice,
expense, and strict regulation of our fishermen, have
built up our Pacifie halibut banks so that they are
among the richest fishing grounds in the world. If

there is nothing under accepted international law

that would prevent a third nation from sending a
mothership expedition to skim the cream off of these
halibut banks, what is the use of building up
fisheries resources in this manner?

There is no sense whatever in sacrificing your

present pleasure to build up savings in a bank if
other people can come in and help themselves to
your money whenever they want.
To meet this new need President Truman issued
a proclamation in September, 1945, to the effect
that the United States might set up conservation
zones to protect its coastal fisheries without regard
to the limitations of territorial waters. Where only
its own nationals are involved the United States
would undertake exclusive jurisdiction (as it might
do at any rate under present international law).
Where the nationals of other countries were involved
with ours those nations might participate in the
jurisdiction over the fishery. The United States
would recognize similar action by other countries in
fisheries off their own coasts.
Note carefully that there was no mention in this
proclamation of extension of sovereignty beyond
territorial waters, nor of exclusion of fishermen of
any nationality from any fishery.
Dr. Chapman, Chairman of the Commission,
head of the American delegation, is an officer
of the Department of State, at Washington.
It would seem to me, therefore, that our problems with the United States would receive
sympathetic consideration. As a practical
example of a current problem I may say that
at the moment Canada, for the protection and
preservation of her shore fisheries, prohibits
the activities of her trawlers within twelve
miles of the shore, yet under international
law the American trawlers are permitted to
operate right in to a distance of three miles off

SENATE

the coast of the Maritime provinces. This,
it seems to me, is a problem that could very
well be given prompt consideration.
This is the first multilateral international
agreement on deep sea fisheries. There have
been bilateral treaties with the United States
affecting the Pacific Coast fisheries, and they
have achieved splendid results. I think the
present move is a forward step in keeping
with the requirements of the modern world.
No nation has surrendered iany of its national
authority, but each is pledged in a definite
way to co-operate with others for their
ultimate common good.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3

I give the usual undertaking that the
passage of this bill will in no way prejudice
the right of any honourable senator to discuss any item in the estimates when the final
appropriation bill is before us.
I ray add that because of the very active
consideration of the estimates which has
been going on for some months by the
various standing committees of the house,
I now ask for interim supply from time to
time with a little more confidence than I
had in days gone by.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I assume that, when the
committees report, our discussion of the
matters involved will not be limited. With
that understanding, I have no objection to
the motion.
The motion was agreed to.

SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart . McL. Robertson moved the

second reading of Bill 251, an Act for granting to His Majesty certain sums of money
for the public service of the financial year
ending the 31st March, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
further interim supply bill to grant moneys
for the public service of the present financial
year. On March 24 last we passed a bill
which granted sufficient moneys to carry
the public service up to the end of May,
by which time, it was hoped that the consideration of the estimates might be conpleted and the final appropriation bill passed.
However, that hope has not been realized,
and in the bill before us the government is
asking for sufficient moneys to finance the
public service to the end of June.
Section 2 of the bill authorizes the granting
of $116,793,505.67, or one-twelfth of all the
items-excepting item No. 170-set out in
the main estimates. This is approximately
one month's supply. Item 170 deals with
certain unemployment insurance payments,
and no further amounts are presently needed
for this purpose. Sections 3, 4 and 5 authorize
for certain items amounts in excess of the
one-twelfth already appropriated for these
items in section 2. These additional amounts
are needed because in the month ahead
expenditures under these particular items
Section 3
will be exceptionally heavy.
would vote $254,000, or one-third of the
items listed in schedule A of this bill. Section
4 would vote $1,441,677, or one-twelfth of
the items listed in schedule B to this bill.
Section 5 would vote $833,333.33 or one-third
of the items listed in schedule C.
No amount mentioned in this bill comprises the total of any item in the estimates.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?

CRIMINAL

CODE BILL

COMMONS AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion for the consideration of the
amendments made by the House of Commons to the
Bill , an Act to amend the Criminal Code.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators

will recall that yesterday I asked the house
to give immediate consideration to these
amendments in order that the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
might have an opportunity to explain them,
the understanding being that the debate
would then be adjourned until today.
I now move concurrence in these amendments.
The motion was agreed to.
RESEARCH COUNCIL

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon.

Mr. Robertson

moved

the

second

reading of Bill 179, an Act to amend the
Research Council Act.
He said: I have asked the honourable
senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchil) to explain this measure.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: This bill seeks to do
three things. The first of these is to increase
the staff of the National Research Council by
the appointment of an additional vice-president (scientific). In 1946, under legislation at

JUNE 1, 1950
that time, there were two vice-presidents
appointed, namely a vice-president (scientific)
and a vice-president (administration). But
in 1947 the Chalk River atomie energy plant
was placed under direction of the National
Research Council, and the vice-president
(scientific) was named as head of that undertaking. This left all other scientific projects
with which the council is concerned without
a vice-president to direct operations, and as a
result the time of the president was largely
devoted to presiding at meetings concerning
the other general scientific matters. This
bill therefore, proposes the appointment of an
additional vice-president (scientific) in order
to relieve the pressure on the president, so
that he can devote more time to the supervision, direction and correlation of the general
work of the Research Council.
The second object of the bill is to incorporate in the law a new definition of the
word "invention". There bas been a conflict
between the definition of "invention" in the
Research Council Act and the definition in
the Patent Act. The present definition in the
the Research Council Act was placed there
in 1924; but since that time changes have
been made in Canada's patent legislation and
the new definition written into the Patent
Act does not coincide with that given in the
Research Council Act. In these times of
increasing chemical invention and atomic
energy development, when patents of invention by officials of the National Research
Council are vested in the ýcouncil itself, it is
particularly necessary that these terms should
agree. Thus it is proposed to insert in this
Act a definition of "invention" which will
coincide with the ýone now appearing in the
Patent Act.
The third object of this legislation is to
give authority to the expression "National
Research Council". In 1924 an order in
council was passed making this term legal,
and now it is thought advisable that it should
be embodied in the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: Can the honourable
senator say who is authorized to appoint this
(scientific), and
additional vice-president
whether his salary range will be the same
as that of the other vice-presidents?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I presume the authority
for the appointment is vested in the Governor
in Council, but I am afraid I cannot say what
the salary range will be. If the honourable
senator from Dorchester thinks it necessary,
the bill could be referred to a committee
where this information could be obtained
from the appropriate officials.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
The motion was agreed to, 'and the bill was
read the third time, andi passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before we adjourn during pleasure, I wish
to remind the house that the Standing Committee on Finance will meet immediately after
the Senate rises. I would also draw attention to the fact that the meeting of the Immigration and Labour Committee, which was
scheduled for eleven o'clock tomorrow morning, bas been postponed because of the
inability of certain witnesses to be present.
Therefore, in order to make the fullest
possible use of our time, I am arranging to
have a meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committee at 11 a.m. tomorrow, when
further consideration will be given to the
amendments to the Income Tax Bill.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

CANADA SHIPPING BILL
FIRST READING
Hon. Mr. Robertson presented Bill Y-8, an
Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the

INCOME TAX BILL

INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should like to ask the
honourable the acting Chairman of the Banking and Commerce Committee (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) whether he is not going to make

Hon. Mr. Robertson: That report is not

Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
EMPLOYMENT SERVICE CONVENTION

MOTION FOR APPROVAL
Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved:
That it is expedient that parliament do approve
of Convention No. 88, Employment Service Convention, 1948, which was adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization at
its thirty-first session at San Francisco on the ninth
day of July, 19'48, and this House do approve of the
same.

He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) to speak to this
motion.
Hon.

Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,

as one long associated with labour and still
carrying a union card, I am pleased indeed
to have the pleasure of explaining this
motion.
The International Labour Organization is
the oldest organization of its kind in existence. It was founded in 1919, at the Paris
Peace Conference, at some meetings of which
Sir Robert Borden was Chairman.
At present Dr. MacNamara, the Deputy
Minister of Labour, is Canada's permanent
representative on the organization.
Sixty nations are members of the organization. Russia is not one of these. In all,

ninety-eight conventions have been adopted
at conferences of the organization. Canada
has approved of twelve of the conventions,
and it may be asked why we have not given
our approval to the others. The explanation
is that many resolutions and conventions
passed by the organization have to do with
states or provinces, and of course Canada
can ratify only conventions respecting matters over which the federal parliament has
jurisdiction.
Honourable members have no doubt
received a copy of the convention which is
now before us. It contains twenty-two articles, all dealing with the one subject-matter.
Briefly, the object of them is the maintenance
of free public employment service, with a
national system of offices under the jurisdiction of the national authority. In effect
they require the co-operation of employers
and workers for the purpose of securing
employment for workers, through national,
regional and local advisory committees.
Through its system of national unemployment insurance, Canada has in fact already
put this convention into effect. Parliament
is now asked to ratify the convention, and
after it is ratified it will be implemented by
order in council.
The motion was agreed to.
ELECTRICAL AND PHOTOMETRIC UNITS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill S-2, an Act respecting
the Units of Electrical and Photometric
Measure.
Honourable senators, this bill
He said:
has been standing on the order paper for
some time, and I am sure that the honourable
leader opposite awaits an explanation of it
with pleasurable anticipation. The purpose
of the bill is to bring the Canadian law
defining the units of electrical and photometric
measure, into line with the laws of Great
Britain, France and the United States, and
thus give effect to the recommendations made
by the International Committee on Weights
and Measurements, on which Canada was
represented.
In the early days of electricity certain ideal
scientific units of electrical quantities were
set up and universally accepted, and various
attempts were made to produce physical
standards which would represent these units.
In 1908, at an international conference held
in London, specifications were adopted which
described how the material standard of the
ohm and of the ampere should be prepared.
These somewhat arbitrary standards were to

JUNE 2, 1950
be known as the "international ohm" and the
"international ampere", and the resulting
system of electrical units became known as
the "international system of units".
Each important national làboratory proceeded to construct its own standards. In
1911 the standards of Great Britain, France,
Germany, and the United States were compared with one another in Washington. The
mean values were taken as the realization of
the definitions of the London Conference. Each
participating laboratory knew how much its
own standards departed from the values of
the international units.
In time scientific knowledge expanded and
measurement techniques improved. The discovery of isotopes rendered the definitions of
1908 less precise than they were originally
believed to be. Numerous determinations by
different laboratories of the size of the "international ohm" and the "international ampere"
in terms of mechanical units of force-that
is, mass, length and time-showed that in the
definitions of 1908 there were slight inaccuracies which had to be allowed for in very
precise measurements.
These and other considerations led to an
increasing desire by all concerned to define
electrical units in terms of the so-called
"absolute units"-that is, to define electrical
quantities in terms of mass, length and timeby means of the effects produced when an
electric current flows under prescribed conditions. The use of absolute units enables
us to realize closely the original ideal scientific units, which was not possible in 1908
because of inadequate precision.
Various official bodies recommended the use
of the absolute system of units in place of
the international units. Finally, at the 8th
General Conference on Weights and Measures,
held in 1933, the change to absolute units
was definitely confirmed. This conference
delegated to the International Committee on
Weights and Measurements the task of fixing
the date for general adoption of absolute
units and determining the ratios of the international units to the absolute uniits. The date
finally agreed to was January 1, 1948, and
appropriate legislative action is required by
the various countries to ratify the decision of
the conference.
It is the purpose of the definitions included
in this bill to base the Canadian standards for
electrical units on the accepted absolute
system.
The difference in the size of the units in the
present and the proposed systems is very
minute, and needs to be taken into account
only in precision work. The ratios ratified
in October, 1948 by the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures were those

adopted by the International Committee on
Weights and Measurements in October, 1946,
and are as follows:
1 mean international ohm-l.00049 absolute
ohm.
1 mean initernational volt-1.00034 absolute
volt.
1 mean international ampere-0.99985 absolute ampere.
The previous definition of ohm, volt and
ampere, contained in chapter 56 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, were in accordance
with the old definitions agreed to at the London Conference of 1908.
Photometric units are not defined at present
in any Canadian statute.
If any honourable senator wants information in addition to what I have already
supplied, I shall be pleased to give it, if I
can. If I cannot, I would hope to have further
technical advice available.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I listened to the honourable gentleman I gathered the impression
that under the new regime the ohm, the volt
and the ampere are to be larger. I should
like to know whether as a consequence our
bills for electricity will be affected.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The information I have
is that the changes are so very small that
only in precision work will account be taken
of them. Whether the bills which my honourable friend pays fall within that category, I must leave him to decide.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If any honourable
senator wishes to further study the bill, third
reading can be deferred to a later sitting;
otherwise I am prepared to move third reading at this time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should think so!
Some Hon. Senators:

Move third reading.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I so move.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
AERONAUTICS BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS

CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the House of Commons to Bill J-4, an Act to amend the Aeronautics Act.

SENATE
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I move concurrence in these amend-

ments.
Honourable senators will remember
when this bill was before this house
iously it was passed and sent to the
place. Subsequently it was returned
two amendments, as follows:

that
prevother
with

1. Page 3, line 10: Strike out the word "subsection" and insert the word "subsections."

This is necessary because the House of
Commons added another subsection.
2. Page 3, line 15: Add the following subsection
to subclause (7) of clause 3:
(4) Every person who violates an order or direction of the minister made under a regulation is
guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars
or to be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six
months or to both fine and imprisonment.

This bill, as it passed the Senate, provided
certain penalties in cases of breaches of
orders and directions made by the minister.
The same penalties applied to breaches of
regulations made by the Governor in Council.
It was felt in the other place that the penalties which attached to breaches of orders and
directions made by the minister should be
less severe than those for breaches of regulations made by the Governor in Council.
For that reason this subsection was added.
It provides that for breaches of orders or
directions made by a minister the penalties
shall be a fine not exceeding $1,000 or
imprisonment not exceeding six months, or
both. In the case of breaches of regulations
made by the Governor in Council the penalties shall be a fine not exceeding $5,000 or
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or
both.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Does that mean that all

the ministers of the Crown will go to jail?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I hope the bill will
not be so interpreted.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Do

not the regulations

made by the minister have to be approved
by order in council?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have not the
phraseology before me, but unless there were
the two types of regulation-one approved by
the Governor in Council and the other by
the minister-the distinction in penalties
would be meaningless.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Usually the regulations
must be approved.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Not in all cases.
I move concurrence in the amendments.
The motion was agreed to.

TARIFF BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second read-

ing of Bill 236, an Act to amend the Tariff
Board Act.
He said: I have asked the honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen) to
explain this bill.
Hon. S. S. McKeen: Honourable senators,
there are two main reasons why the Tariff
Board Act should be amended at this time.
This Act originally consisted of two parts.
The first part dealt with inquiries, and
clearly defined the powers of the Board,
which were wide. The second part dealt with
appeals the hearings of which were conducted
quite informally; and here the powers we;e
not ;clearly defined. In 1948 these two parts
of the Act were consolidated, but the question of whether the same powers then applied
to both an appeal and an inquiry was left
in doubt.
A recent amendment to the Customs Act
extends the classes of persons who are enFormerly
titled to appeal to the Board.
only an importer could do so, but now anyone who feels that he is adversely affected
may, appear as a witness at an appeal hearing; launch an appeal to the Tariff Board
on his own behalf; or if necessary, appeal to
the Exchequer Court. With the increased
number of persons who now have the right
of appeal, the hearings could no longer be
carried on in the same informal way as when
only the importer had that right. Therefore
it has become necessary to re-define the
powers of the board, and this amendment
clearly sets out that on an appeal the board
shall have the same powers, with a few
exceptions, as on an inquiry.
Subsection 3, of section 5, of the Act, which
deals with compelling witnesses to attend at
hearings, is not necessary, -and section 1 will
apply. In all likelihood this section will never
be used, because the appellants having asked
for the hearing themselves, will be quite willing to attend and produce all their papers and
documents.
In specifi.c cases, under subsection 7 of section 5, one member of the Board- shall constitute a quorum and have power to conduct
inquiries. These inquiries do not affect the
public in the same way as other hearings,
because the reports are made only to theminister and are not for the use of importers.
or the general public.
Both subsection 7 and 8 or section 5 deal
with specific inquiries, -and do not apply in

JUNE 2, 1950
the case of an appeal. These inquiries include
those instituted by the minister on specific
subjects, and the report is for his use only
and not for the general public. With these
exceptions, it is felt that the Board now has
all the authority required to hear appeals.
The amendment proposed by the bill before
us gives greater freedom of action to businessmen, in that they can appeal any departmental
order which they think is injurious to them.
It indicates a tendency to get away from
what we call bureaucratic control, and I
believe it is a step in the right direction. I
think this move will encourage business generally, and will lead to the stabilization and

expansion of trade. For these reasons I feel
that legislation of this kind should receive the
wholehearted support of this chamber.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE VI
BIRTHDAY FELICITATIONS

Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,

before the orders of the day are called I

British Commonwealth of Nations is today

King George VI was born on December 14,
but out of respect for his late father, His

On this. occasion of the King's birthday I
think it is only fitting that we should express
our gratitude to Divine Providence, and that
we should also present our most humble duty
to His Majesty the King, wishing health,
happiness, joy and prosperity to him, to Her

CANADIAN AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of Bill X-8, an Act to amend the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
He said: I have asked the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) to
explain the bill.
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo: Honourable senators,
this is one of two bills which are more or
less related-Bill X-8, an Act to amend the
Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, 1932, and the companion Bill W-8, an Act
to amend the Foreign Insurance Companies
Act, 1932. I mention the latter bill at this
time because all the amendments made by
Bill X-8 in relation to British companies are,
by Bill W-8, made applicable to foreign companies.
Canada's original legislation with respect
ta insurance companies was passed shortly
after confederation, in 1868, and was amended
and revised from time to time thereafter until
1932, when it was consolidated in the Acts to
which I have just made reference. Since that
time there have been only minor amendments.
The purpose of the present bill is to bring
the legislation of 1932 more generally into
conformity with current conditions, and to
55950-27

remove certain anomalies in the treatment of
Canadian companies as compared with
British and foreign companies.
There are long schedules attached to the
bill, and there is one very lengthy section
which deals with the type of investment the
companies may make; but in reality there
are few new principles involved in the
legislation.
In referring to changing conditions it is
perhaps relevant to say that the life insurance
business,
particularly
in Canada,
has
increased seven-fold during the past three
decades. The number of life insurance contracts in force in Canada has grown in round
figures, as follows: At the end of 1919 the
total 'business in force was $2 billion; ten
years later, at the end of 1929, this had
increased to $6 billion. Nothwithstanding
the depression, the total figure remained at
$6 'billion at the end of 1939, and at the
end of 1949 the total had reached $14
billion. Some of the companies doubled their
business in a five-year period. It will be
apparent, therefore, what a prominent place
this insurance business holds in the economy
of our country.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
attempt to refer to the particular sections of
the bill, but the first and most important matter that is dealt with is the investment powers
of the Canadian companies. These are being
enlarged in some respects and modified in
others; I shall refer only to the more
important changes.
It is proposed that in addition to investing
in securities of the Canadian government,
of the governments of commonwealth countries, of the United States or of any state of
the Union, any Canadian insurance company
be permitted to invest in the government
securities of a country in which the company
is carrying on business. This constitutes a
change, because heretofore companies have
been permitted to purchase securities of any
foreign country. It is felt that it is a good
principle for a Canadian insurance company
ta invest in the currency or securities of a
foreign country only to the extent that it has
liabilities in that country.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It is a restriction.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: In a sense it is, but there
is no limitation as to the amount; neither
is there any provision that the company
must purchase securities of any foreign country in which it is doing business to the extent
of its liabilities in that country. As a matter of fact, in many cases the companies
would not wish to do this.
The second important change has to do
with what are called revenue bonds. During
recent years it has been common practice to

SENATE
set up government agencies to erect and
operate certain government projects. We
have ports, harbours, bridges, communication
systems, electric and gas services, and so on,
which are operated by public authority, each
of which in turn issue securities on ithe basis
of the revenue of the particular project. A
good example would be the Port of London
Authority or the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Authority or any lother body of that character.
The securities of these bodies are known to
be good, and it is now proposed that the
power of Canadian companies to invest in
t
such securities be enlarged ·o include revenue
bonds of this type in other countries as well
as in Canada. In effect, those other countries
would be largely the United Kingdom and the
United States. That is an extension.
A further important extension is in the
field of equipment trust certificates issued by
railways on rolling equipment. At the present time our companies are permitted to
invest in such certificates issued by Canadian
railways. The amendment would permit the
purchase of equipment trust certificates
issued by United States railways as well.
There is also a rather important change as
to the purchase of corporation debentures by
insurance companies. The present Act provides that companies may invest in debentures of corporations with certain dividend
records; that is, corporations which have
regularly paid their dividends for a period
of five years. This bill proposes an alternative test for corporation debentures, an earnings test, whereby companies may invest in
the debentures of a corporation whose earnings during the preceding five years have
been at least ten times its annual interest
requirements and in each of any four of five
years at least one and one half times its
annual interest requirements. This earnings
test is an alternative test, in the sense that
it will be permissible to apply it or the
former dividend test.
As to the pur'hase of common shares there
is a rather important change. Heretofore
companies were permitted to purchase common shares up to a given amount, provided
dividends on these shares had been paid
regularly for a period of seven years at a
rate of at least 4 per cent of the par value of
the shares or, in the case of shares without
par value, at the rate of $4 per share. The
change provides that the required dividends
shall be equal to at least 4 per cent of the
average value at which the shares have been
carried on the books of the corporation or
were carried during the years in which the
dividends were paid. As honourable senators
will realize, the provision that no-par shares
must pay a dividend of at least $4 would have

the effect of eliminating a good many shares
which otherwise might be considered good
investments.
Another modernization, if I may so call it,
permits companies to invest in income realty.
In some places there has grown up a practice
whereby insurance companies have purchased
buildings having good tenants with longterm leases at fixed rentals. The proposal is
to permit companies to invest in real estate
for the production of income, provided that
the real estate purchased is leased to a corporation having a reliable financial record,
and that the terms of the lease are such as to
return at least 85 per cent of the investment
together with a reasonable rate of interest
over the period of the lease, but not exceeding thirty years. The financial standing of
the corporation-that is the tenant corporation-would be covered by an earnings test
similar to that used to determine whether its
debentures would qualify for investment by
insurance companies. Arrangements of this
nature have become very popular in the
financing of commercial firms in recent years.
However, inasmuch as this is a new departure
in Canada, it is proposed that a company be
not allowed to invest more than 5 per cent of
its assets in this type of investment. And
any purchase of real estate by a company
under the so-called "basket clause," which
permits companies to place up to 3 per cent
of their assets in investments outside the
classes listed as approved, will be applied
against this 5 per cent limit.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Is there any provision in this bill whereby the Superintendent
of Insurance or some other authority may
give a ruling as to whether any particular
investment is permitted? In actual practice
in the past there has been a good deal of
doubt as to whether particular investments
did or did not fall within the approved
classes, and it has never been possible to get
a ruling. I wondered whether in such cases,
this bill provided for a ruling by the Superintendent of Insurance or other authority.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Although I cannot put my
finger on the appropriate section or subsection, I am quite sure that in the bill or the
Act there is a provision that all investments
must be regularly reported to the Superintendent of Insurance, and that a record must
be kept by him and also by the Treasury
Board.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But the question sometimes arises whether a company has the right
to invest in a particular security.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I understand that if a
company has invested in something that is
not in an approved class, it is required to
dispose of it.

JUNE 5, 195U
British and foreign insurance companies
operating in Canada are at present required,
and have been for many years, to maintain
in Canada assets equal to the liabilities on
their Canadian business. These assets must
be on deposit with the Receiver General, or
vested in a trust for that purpose. The
present Acts include schedules setting forth
such assets as the companies may purchase
for this purpose, but the schedules have
contained a good many inconsistencies, which
this bill proposes to remove. Further, these
assets on deposit or vested in trust are,
except for securities issued by the government of any commonwealth country or of
the United States, to be limited to Canadian
securities only. The view is that Canadian
dollar liabilities should be covered as far
as practicable by Canadian dollar assets.
Though to some degree restricting the investment powers of any British and foreign
insurance company, this will in another way
enlarge its investment powers, and will
allow it to include in its portfolio certain
bonds secured by dominion payment or by
provincial subsidies, cash in the hands of a
trustee or in a trust account in a chartered
bank, and real estate in Canada for the
company's own use and occupancy. Also the
3 per cent "basket clause," under which
securities not otherwise authorized may be
purchased, is now made applicable to British
and Foreign companies.
The bill provides a further amendment
which is important to both the insurance
company and the public. It has to do with
the value at which securities are carried in
the books of the company. At present all
insurance companies registered under the
Act must show in their annual statements
the market value of their securities. In
practice the companies have been more conservative in that they have taken their
securities into account at market value or
at book value, whichever is the lesser, and
this practice has been encouraged by the
department. It is proposed that life insurance companies be permitted to carry securities issued by the government of Canada or
of any province of Canada, or by the government of the United States or of the United
Kingdom, at values not exceeding their
amortized values. These values are calculated mathematically, having regard to purchase price, actual interest payments, date
of maturity and the amount to be received
at maturity.

value of securities fell so low that the companies were practically bankrupt, to fix a
value for securities which would permit
companies to remain solvent? At the time
to which I refer the companies were allowed
to carry securities at a figure higher than
the actual market value.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: The section known as the
"authorized value" section is still in the
statute, and will remain in force. Notwithstanding the fluctuations in value from time
to time, government securities are purchased
by life insurance companies at the time of
issue, and ordinarily they are held until
maturity. In that way the fluctuations have
no real effect on the value of the securities.
All insurance companies other than life companies are required to report securities at
market value, and life insurance companies
must report not only the amortised value but
also the market value of the securities which
they carry.
The bill provides that with respect to
British and foreign insurance companies the
Treasury Board be given the power when it
considers the assets of a company held in
Canada insufficient to protect its policyholders, to call upon that company to increase its
deposit of securities.
Honourable senators will observe that the
section governing the appointment of directors and the meetings of directors has been
redrafted and clarified. Amongst other things
it provides the procedure to be followed as
to the production of documents and the
transfer of stock when a shareholder dies.
This is similar to the requirements of the
Bank Act.
The bill permits Canadian insurance companies, the shares of which are fully paid, to
reduce their par value from $100 to a minimum, I believe, of $10 per share. This section
follows to some extent the amendment to the
banking legislation of a few years ago,
except that in this case it is not compulsory.
The bill also provides a change with respect
to the value of shares held by a director,
which heretofore has been fixed at not less
than $2,500 of capital stock. By reason of the
high value which the shares of some companies have attained, the purchase of $2,500
worth of par value stock would today require
an investment of as much as $10,000 or
$12,000. The amendment proposes that a
director be required to hold shares on which
at least $1,000 has been paid.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask whether it is
A further amendment permits the appointstill within the power of the Governor in ment in certain circumstances of additional
Council in times of economic stress, such directors without changing the charter of the
as we had some years avo wh-n the market company.
55950-27à

SENATE
The present act requires the Superintendent of Insurance to visit the head office of
each company at least once a year, and
examine into its affairs. With the growth of
business it is now proposed that where in the
opinion of the superintendent the circumstances so warrant, he may visit the offices
and make such examination less frequently
than annually but not less frequently than
once in every three years.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Does that mean that the
inspection will take place only once in three
years?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: That might happen, but
the visits will not be at regular intervals. The
fact is that the larger companies, whose books
are audited by well-established firms, supply
regular statements, and it is felt that, in some
cases, an annual inspection is not necessary.
The bill proposes to grant to fraternal
benefit societies the power to write personal
accident and sickness insurance. The societies which have been incorporated within
recent years have that right, but some of
the long-established societies are not permitted to do that type of business under their
charters. In this way all will be brought into
line. It is further proposed to remove the
requirement which limits to $10,000 the life
insurance which may be issued to any one
member, and to place upon the actuary of the
society the responsibility of determining the
maximum amount of insurance appropriate in
any particular circumstance. It is recognized
that the limit of $10,000 is too high for some
of the smaller companies, and probably low
for some of the others.
Another amendment provides for the amalgamation of fire and casualty companies, and
enables them to enter into agreements for
amalgamation with other companies or for
reinsurance of their business. This rectifies an
Existing legislation provides a
omission.
code for the amalgamation or merger of life
insurance companies, but has no such provision as regards fire and casualty companies.
Any agreement entered into pursuant to this
section will be subject, as a condition precedent, to the permission of the minister and
the approval of the Treasury Board; other
procedure will be the same as is now required
for the merger of life insurance companies.
Under the law as it stands, the only way
whereby a fire insurance or casualty company can go out of business is through
bankruptcy proceedings.
Other changes which are proposed for the
better operation of the law relate to the execution and filing of annual and half-yearly
statements showing the movement of securities of life insurance companies, boards of

directors of Canadian companies, the addition of approved tables of mortality and for
the maximum rate of interest at which life
insurance annuity contracts are to be valued,
the computation of reserves in fire and casualty companies, and certain sections having
reference to British and foreign companies
which were carrying on business in Canada
prior to 1878.
That, honourable senators, is a brief
review of the outstanding changes contained
in this bill. As I have already pointed out,
it will be found by reference to Bill W-8,
which we shall examine later, that it makes
applicable to foreign companies the changes
which in the bill now before us are prescribed
for British companies.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Can the honourable senator
tell me whether the insurance companies
that are affected by the radical changes now
introduced have been consulted?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I understand that this legislation has been under consideration for quite
a long time, that there has been close communication with the representatives of the
companies, and that the underwriters have
had a committee working with the Department of Insurance. I am also in a position
to say that the amendments proposed are
acceptable to the underwriters. Perhaps it
may be proper to add that some of the amendments do not go as far as the companies
wished, but the bill represents the position
at which the parties arrived after many and
long consultations.
Hon. John T. Haig: I have read through
the bill, and I do not object to it. However,
it is significant of the fact that the administration allows so low a rate of interest on
government securities that, with the limited
returns received, companies cannot carry on
their business effectively. Rightly or wrongly,
this bill is a direct attempt, probably as a
matter of necessity, to allow companies to
enter fields of investment which will provide
a larger net return. Anybody with the least
knowledge of the insurance business knows
that insurance companies can no longer carry
on their business with the proceeds of the
type of investment to which they are limited,
and which, twenty or twenty-five years ago
was adequate for their purposes.
In considering legislation of this kind, the
question which comes to my mind is: What
will be the consequences in certain directions
of enlarging the field of investment? I am
not so much afraid of the results in the case
of well managed companies, but the illustration given by the honourable senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) bas a quite definite
application in some of the western cities. I

JUNE 5, 1950
am thinking particularly of the city in which
I live, and of the position of chain stores
which operate anywhere from ten to forty
places of business in one community. They
started by acquiring ownership of the buildings they used: later, as their operations
increased, they found that to purchase .all the
properties they required would involve them
in much more capital expenditure than they
could afford. They therefore evolved a plan
of selling properties at anywhere from
$40,000 to $100,000, and obtaining leases of
them on terms which gave a reasonable rate
of interest and provided for amortization
within a period of twenty years. As long as
everything went well this plan would prove
quite profitable; but if the coinpany were to
go broke it would be, of course, the reverse
of profitable, because most buildings erected
or adapted as chain stores can be used only
for that purpose.
I repeat that I am not objecting to the bill.
, regard it as a great improvement on the
present Act, of which, as my honourable
friend has pointed out, it is also a consolidation. But in so far as it represents an attempt
to widen the investment field, I suggest to this
house and to the insurance companies that it
w'ill necessitate greater control over the
investments. There is not much risk or complication in purchasing debentures of a recognized company, or in putting money into
mortgages. Loans may be made on land up
to 60 per cent of the appraised value, and
though there may be short fluctuations, the
experience of one hundred and fifty years in
the United States shows that the value of this
type of property, especially bouses, continues
to grow over periods of about eighteen years.
I am a one hundred per cent believer in
insurance. It should be encouraged in every
possible way. It is one of the finest forms of
saving that any man or woman can makeat any rate until he or she bas reached fifty
years of age-and we should do all we can to
extend and popularize it. But inevitably, if
we widen the field of investment, much more
inspection will become necessary, not as far
as the old established companies are concerned, but in connection with companies
which have been formed within the last
twenty or twenty-five years, and which of
course onust compete with the older-established corporations. I say this although I
recognize that the policies of all the companies
are more or less the same, because their
reserves are held under a regular system, and
must be maintained in accordance with it, or
else their licence to do business may be
withdrawn.
. I am in favour of these amendments, but
[ want to warn the department that it will
have much more work to do than it had in

the past. I do not wish to be a pessimist;
but when you make that rental extension
you are going into business again. I do not
know whether prices have reached their peak
or not, but I do not think they can be maintained at their present high-level. I think
the provisions for inspection will have to be
increased, because all this bill really does is
to extend to insurance companies the powers
to invest in securities which are not now
available to them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I
agree with what the leader opposite (Hon.
ir. Haig) has said about the desirability of
these amendments, but I do not entirely
agree with him in the matter of mortgages. I
think there is a real danger of some insurance
companies advancing too much money on
individual mortgages. Even with the present
high costs, insurance companies will lend on
mortgages as much as 60 per cent, and some
times even more.
Certainly the amount
which they will lend on government housing
projects is very high. My honourable friend
opposite doubts whether values will ever fall
to their previous level. I am not so sure.
The only factor that makes it reasonably safe
to invest in high-priced bouses is that the
payments are amortized and enough principal
is paid off in four or five years to provide
reasonable security. Before prices went so
high, some apartment buildings in Toronto
and Montreal had valuations placed on them
by valuators before they were erected, so that
the advance of 60 per cent of the valuation
paid for the whole building, and there was
really no margin of security.
What I really rose to say-and perhaps I
am out of order-is that the honourable
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) did
not mention an amendment which I should
like to see made to the Insurance Act. I
refer to the desirability of making it possible
for stock insurance companies to mutualize.
We now have mutual companies which are
entirely mutual, and others which are a
combination of stock and mutual. As a
general rule it is rather desirable that insurance companies should be mutualized, and
without referring to any particular companies I think I could name some that would
like to mutualize, but which under the
present law cannot do so. Some of these
companies have not even got their par value
-which is usually $100 a share-paid up;
they might have only 50 or 75 per cent paid
up. Because of past profits and so on, the
stocks of some of these insurance companies
have climbed to $200, $250 or $400 a share.
I remember one company whose stock some
years ago sold at $1,000 a share.

SENATE
As I say, these insurance companies find
it absolutely impossible to mutualize; that is,
to sell their shares to the policyholders.
Take a compagny whose stock is valued at
$400 a share and which is sold by the shareholders to the policyholders. If $100 is par
value and the stock is sold at $400 a share,
the $300 in excess of the $100 par value
becomes subject to income tax. The companies simply cannot afford to do this. "Well,"
you may say "somebody has made a profit
somewhere." That is true, but the rise in
value was gradual. The man who bought
his stock at $100 a share and sold it at $150
made a capital gain of $50, and that gain
was not subject to income tax. The value
then went to $200, and finally to $400 a share
by reason of capital gains not being subject
to income tax. When the man who pays
$400 for a share is asked whether he would
like to mutualize, he replies, "I am satisfied
to take $400 for my share because that is
what I paid for it-perhaps a little more
or less-but I will not sell if I have to pay
income tax on the $300 over the $100 par
value."
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would not that enhanced
value be created by accumulated and undivided profits? Profits so accumulated and
undivided are taxable in the hands of the

cited by my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), if a stock company
attempted to become a mutual company and
sold its shares on the basis of the value
created by accumulated profits, that part of
the purchase price which represents accumulated and undivided profits would be taxable
under the Income Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is what I said a
moment ago. Certainly this is a result of
profits made in the past. But the person
now holding the stock did not get those
profits. He paid $400 a share because the
stock was worth that figure at the time he
purchased it, and that share value was
reached as a result of accumulation over
many years. This stock may have passed
from hand to hand and been rising in value
all the time. If my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) bought stock at $400
a share, of which $300 was accumulated
profits, I am pretty sure he would not want
to sell at $400 a share if he were going to
be taxed on the $300 of increased value.
My point is that the person who now
owns the stock is probably not the one who
in the first instance paid only $100 a share for
it. You might say that a man has to look out

for himself when he makes investments; but
I maintain that this taxation makes it utterly
impossible to mutualize a company whose
stock is selling at a very much enhanced
value. Shareholders just will not mutualize
if what to them is capital is taxed as income.
They will say, "I would sooner sell my stock
to some other shareholder."
Hon. Mr. Vien: Why would it be more
difficult to do this in Canada now than it
was some time ago in the United States,
when the Metropolitan Life and other insurance companies became mutual institutions?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not know about that
particular arrangement.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is long before high
income tax was being paid.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Probably.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is the case of the
North American Life.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes. The North American
Life and another company mutualized without
being subject to income tax on the accumulated value of shares; but that sort of thing
cannot be done now. My point is this. If it
were regarded as desirable-and I am inclined
to think it is-that life insurance companies
should be mutualized and become the property
of the policyholders themselves, some provision would have to be made so that the present
owner of the shares would not be taxed so
heavily as to make mutualization utterly
impracticable.

MOTION FOR SECOND READING POSTPONED
On the Order: Second reading of Bill Y-8, an
Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.-Hon.
Mr. Robertson.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: Honourable senators,
I had intended to move the second reading

printers are swamped with work. In the
circumstances I must ask that the order stand.
The Hon. the Speaker: The order stands.
CANADA GRAIN BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 249, an Act to amend
the Canada Grain Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Canada
Grain Act applies to all elevators in Canada
used for the storage of western grain. To
ensure the proper handling and disposal of
each wheat crop, the Act makes extensive
provisions for the control and inspection of
these elevators. The bill before us proposes
to make minor changes in the Act.
Sections 1 and 6 of the bill provide that the
Board of Grain Commissioners may make
regulations to govern the receipt and storage
of grain grown outside Canada and brought
here for reshipment. These provisions are
necessary so that the board may ensure adequate storage for western grain.
Section 2 provides for a change in the
method of publication of regulations of the
Board of Grain Commissioners in the Canada
Gazette.
Section 3 is designed to make clear that
persons who purchase grain, and are not
licensed under the Act, may not use the
statutory forms.
Section 4 provides an additional method by
which grain may be released from an elevator.
It would allow grain to be released on order
or regulation of the Board of Grain Commissioners.
In snaller country areas certain mills are
licensed as grain elevators. However, an
ordinary elevator is not allowed to receive
grain from railway cars for milling and manufacture. Section 5 provides that country mills,
though licensed as elevators, may receive
grain for milling and manufacture.
Sections 7 and 8 make certain changes in
the weigh-over procedure, which requires the
grain in each elevator to be weighed every
crop year and checked against the records.

Not less than nine months nor more than
twenty-two months may intervene between
two weigh-overs. This requirement has caused
hardship, because during some crop years
storage congestion or mishap at the elevator
has made it inconvenient to carry out the
procedure. The proposed changes would give
the Grain Commissioners the power to determine if a weigh-over had to take place each
year. However, there is no change in the
requirement that a weigh-over must take
place at least every twenty-two months.
Section 10 would declare all elevators in
Canada to be works for the general advantage
of Canada. At present ail elevators mentioned
in Schedule 4 of the Canada Grain Act are
declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada. This schedule is old and out
of date, and the proposed wording is considered preferable.
Sections 11 and 12 are technical changes
in the definitions of certain grades of grain.
Section 13 repeals section 233 of the present
Act, which is replaced by section 10 of the
bill. Section 233 provides that "all grain
elevators and warehouses, of whatever variety
or kind, mentioned in this Act" are declared
to be works for the general advantage of
Canada; and for greater certainty, but not
to restrict the generality of that provision, it
is declared that every grain elevator mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Act
is a work for the general advantage of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable leader a question? In declaring these
elevators to be works for the general advantage of Canada, is the object to get them out
of provincial jurisdiction and into dominion
jurisdiction?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should fancy so.
From my reading of section 233 I take it
that the chief effect of section 10 of this
bill is to improve the phraseology of the
Act. My understanding is that the section
does not increase the number of elevators
declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada. If this view is wrong, it
will undoubtedly be corrected in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
with leave, I would move that this bill be
referred to committee, and I presume the
appropriate one is the Committee on Natural
Resources. However, at this stage of the session there is an advantage in having the bills
handled by a committee which is sitting frequently, and which as soon as it finishes with

SENATE

one measure can proceed to another. In these
circumstances, it occurs to me that it might
be well to send this bill to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, and unless there
is some objection I will move that this be
done.
The motion agreed to.
NATIONAL PARKS BILL

COMMONS AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the House of
Commons to Bill 0-6, an Act to amend the
National Parks Act.
Hon. T. A. Crerar moved concurrence in
the amendments.
He said: Honourable senators will recall that
when this bill was presented to us a few weeks
ago it contained a section seeking permission
to levy a tax upon the interest of any person
in land in a park. This provision, which was
beyond the competence of the Senate to deal
with, was deleted when the bill was before
the Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
The bill was subsequently passed by this house
and went to the House of Commons where the
deleted section was restored.
The bill is again before us, and in accordance with proper procedure I have moved concurrence in the amendment made in another
place.
The motion was agreed to.

CONVENTION OF NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion of
the Honourable Senator Euler, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Crerar, that the Senate of Canada approves of the calling by the United States of
America of a Convention of delegates from the
democracies which sponsored the North Atlantic
treaty and representing the principal political
parties of such democracies, for the purpose of
exploring how far their peoples and the peoples of
such other democracies as the Convention may
invite to send delegates, can apply among them
within the framework of the United Nations, the
principles of federal union.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, as the

honourable member from Blaine Lake, whose
name appears at the foot of this order (Hon.
Mr. Horner) is a member of the Joint Committee on Old Age Security which meets every
afternoon at 4 p.m. and every evening at 8
p.m., it will be impossible for him to speak to
this motion for at least three or four days.
I would suggest, therefore, that if any other
honourable member wishes to speak tonight
he should do so, and I will then adjourn the
debate for the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake. If no one wishes to speak at this time,
I would ask that the order stand.

The Order stands.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

on the Library of Parliament.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
Your committee begs to present its first report on

the Library of Parliament.
Your committee held a meeting on May 23, 1950,
and considered the agenda prepared by the Joint
Librarians. Your committee begs to submit the
following recommendations:
1. That the necessary steps be taken to erect a
library building for the National Library, in which
could be stored all books surplus to the needs of the
Library of Parliament; and that in the meantime
the Department of Public Works be requested to
provide space for the storage of such' books.
2. That the Civil Service Commission be requested
to increase the establishment of the Library of
Parliament by the addition of two positions: (1)
Cataloguer (English) as from January 1, 1950, to be
filled by Miss Florence Moore, at present Librarian
Grade I, Library of Parliament; (2) Librarian
Grade II (French).
3. That the sum of $1,000 be provided annually in
the estimates for the microfilming of old and valuable newspapers and periodicals in order to complete the bound files in the library.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I move that the report
be taken into consideration tomorrow.
CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 252, an Act to amend the
Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
The bill was read the first time.
CANADA SHIPPING BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill Y-8, an Act to amend
the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that the Canada Shipping Act was enacted by
parliament in 1934 after lengthy debate and
55950-28

consideration in the Senate. In 1948 a government bill containing important amend.
ments to the Act was introduced in the
Senate, and was passed after careful study.
It is proposed that the same procedure be
followed with respect to the present bill.
The main purpose of the bill is to provide
the legislative basis required to implement
the Internatiorial Convention for the Safety
of Life at Sea, 1948, which was signed in
London on June 10, 1948. The convention
was signed by two of the Canadian delegates,
and is subject to acceptance by the Canadian
government. The government proposes to
accept the convention if parliament enacts
the proposed Canada Shipping Act amendments contained in this bill which relate to
the convention.
Honourable senators will recall that the
safety convention of 1929 is set out in the
fourth schedule of the Canada Shipping Act,
and that frequent references are made to it
in different sections of the Act. It becomes
necessary, therefore, to amend the Act in
order to bring its provisions into line with
the new convention.
The safety convention of 1948 consists of
fifteen articles, accompanied by six chapters
of technical regulations. I shall not attempt
to deal with these in detail, as the convention
is set out in full in the schedule to the bill.
Chapter I of the bill contains general provisions for the application of regulations.
Generally speaking, these regulations apply
to passenger ships and cargo ships of 500 tons
gross tonnage and upwards engaged on international voyages. Special exemption is given
to vessels solely engaged in navigating the
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence river as
far east as Montreal.
Chapter II deals with the construction of
ships from the safety standpoint, having
special regard to the prevention or mitigation
of casualties. This chapter contains regulations setting forth definite requirements for
protection against fire, and these requirements
considerably exceed those of the 1929
Convention.
Chapter III deals with life-saving appliances and emergency musters and drills. An
important advance beyond the 1929 standards
is the extension of many requirements to
cargo ships of 500 tons and upwards.
Chapter IV covers radiotelegraphy and
radiotelephony. This chapter requires cargo
vessels of 500 gross tons and over but under
1,600 gross tons to be equipped with radiotelephone if not fitted with a radiotelegraph
installation. The technical requirements as
to radiotelegraph installations, both on board

SENATE
ship and for use in lifeboats, represent a substantial advance over those contained in the
1929 convention.
Chapter V deals with safety of navigation.
This chapter generally applies to all ships on
all voyages, saving only men-of-war.
The
provisions relating to meteorological services
have been re-arranged and expanded. The
requirement of direction-finders on board
ship has been extended to all ships of 1,600
gross tons and upwards, as compared to
passenger ships only of 5,000 gross tons and
upwards, as required by the 1929 convention.
Chapter VI deals with the carriage of
The subject of grain
dangerous cargoes.
cargoes is dealt with specifically in detail,
and there are requirements that adequate
shifting boards shall be provided. In Canada
there are now in force regulations made under
the Canada Shipping Act covering the carriage of dangerous goods and the stowage of
grain cargoes. These basic principles are
now written into the International Regulations.
In general it may be said that no provision
:>f the 1929 convention was relaxed, that
many of its provisions were revised upward,
and that the 1948 convention is a definite
improvement upon its predecessor. Many
new subjects, such as aids to navigation,
search and rescue, life-saving signals, pilot
ladders, and the carriage of grain and dangerous goods, were treated for the first time. I
think it may be said that all the changes
made in the new convention are in the
direction of increased safety and take into
account the advances made in ship construction and seamanship since 1929.
The convention will go into force one year
after fifteen governments, including at least
seven governments having not less than one
million gross tons of shipping, have deposited
their acceptances. At the present time, I
am advised, the convention has been accepted
by the United Kingdom, the United States of
America and the French Republic. It is
expected that Canada will take the necessary
steps to accept the convention as soon as possible after this bill is passed.
Apart from the requirements of the safety
convention, there are in the bill other provisions which the government considers it
advisable to enact, and on which I shall
make a few brief comments. There are
amendments designed to enable Canadian
consular officers, wherever possible, to take
over the duties and responsibilities now performed by British consular officers with
respect to Canadian ships and seamen. At
ports where there are no Canadian consular
officers, the British consular officers will continue to act for Canada, as in the past.

In order to give ships registered in Canada
a definite status as Canadian ships, it is proposed to define a Canadian ship as a ship
registered in Canada, and to use the expression "Canadian ship" throughout the Act in
place of the descriptive words "British ship
registered in Canada" and "ship registered in
Canada", which now appear in the Act. At
the same time a British ship is defined to
include a Canadian ship, so that Canadian
ships will retain their stattis as British
ships. The change is one of terminology only
and does not affect the legal status of ships of
Canadian registry.
There are also amendments concerning the
licensing requirements of small craft under
10 tons registered tonnage. In this connection the government feels that the problem
should be dealt with by regulation rather
than by statutory provision. The bill provides for regulations covering the licensing
for identification purposes of small vessels
under 10 tons registered tonnage maintained
in Canada by aliens; the licensing of vessels
equipped with outboard motors; the marking
of licensed vessels; the exemption from the
licensing requirements of certain vessels to
take care of special cases; and the imposition
of a penalty for failure to license and mark.
There is also a provision in the bill to
permit the issuance of temporary certificates,
as master, to persons qualified to take charge
of motor vessels not exceeding 65 feet in
length, carrying passengers in an open cockpit or in a cockpit which is covered by a
light trunk cabin, and plying on the inland
or minor waters of Canada within specified
limits. This provision would permit the
operation of large motorboats carrying passengers in sheltered waters where the operators have local knowledge of the conditions
but do not hold permanent certificates.
The bill contains
other miscellaneous
amendments, including amendments relating
to the pilotage service, and other matters that
will be explained in detail when the bill is
considered in committee, to which I intend to
move that the bill be referred, if the house in
its wisdom sees fit to pass the motion for
second reading.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I had expected that some of our distinguished
members who have a knowledge of shipping
would have something to say at this time. As
for myself, I could tell in a minute all I know
about shipping, but to tell what I do not
know about it would require a week.
I have read the bill, and it would appear
that its purpose is to ratify certain conventions which have been agreed to. Without
knowing anything about these conventions
it would be foolish of me to say that I am
entirely in favour of them.

JUNE 6, 1950
My particular purpose in rising at this time
is te draw the attention of the house ta the
fact that many senators on this side who
are members of the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications are also
members of other active committees. The
lèader of the government may not 'agree, but
I think that this house should appoint a
special committee of about ten senators who
represent the east and west coasts of Canada
ta consider this bill and report back ta the
house.
I have just now looked over the membership of the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, and on it I find the names
of the honourable deputy leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the honourable member
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and
myself. As this is the legal committee of
the Senate, I am anxious ta attend all its
meetings. I have the honour also to be a
member of the Finance Committee, and
though I do not always agree with its chairman, I think he. is rendering a magnificent
serviceSome Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -and I want ta attend its
meetings and help ta bring in a report that
will justify the investigations which the
committee has made.
I would therefore urge the leader of the
government ta appoint a special committee
of ten or twelve, consisting of senators from
Newfoundland, the Maritime Provinces, Quebec and British Columbia, ta consider this
bill. Ontario might be included, but it is
about as maritime as Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Winnipeg is pretty wet.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Churchill is a port, and
certainly we have lots of water in Winnipeg,
but for shipping you need something more.
Such a committee as I suggest would facilitate the bringing in of an early report and
prevent any delay in the passage of the bill
through this house. I do not want ta give
another place any excuse for saying that the
Senate held up legislation, and that but for
us parliament ýcould have prorogued by
July 1.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
this voluminous bill, consisting of 150 pages,
became available ta the members of this
house only this morning. As the leader has
said, it is an attempt ta provide greater
safety at sea and to bring shipping up to
date by the use of modern inventions. As
ta the appointment of a committee composed
of maritime members, both east and west,
I think it will be observed that the inland
trade of the Great Lakes is equally as
important as the coasting trade.
55950-281

Hon. Mr. Haig: But the bill does not refer
ta that branch of shipping.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I think that the committee should have some representation from
the Great Lakes shipping interests.
Many people believe that this bill should
include provisions for the protection of the
coasting trade of this country. Canadian
shipping is open ta outside competition from
the ships of nations whose standards of living
and costs of operation are much lower than
ours. The United States protects its coasting
trade, but we leave ours wide open. The
bill does not appear ta deal with the question
of protection.
At the last session of parliament the
National Defence BiH was introduced in the
Senate and was passed by this house, but
it did not get through the other house. As
this bill has come te us late in the session,
it may be that it also will not be passed by
the other place this year. In any event,
it should be given most careful consideration.
The provision of the bill that requires
small craft of under ten tons registered
tonnage te be licensed is an important one;
but we should know how much the licence
will cost. There seems te be an arbitrary
division between vessels of less than 500 tons
gross tonnage and those of greater tonnage.
For the protection of those concerned this
provision should be carefully considered.
Generally speaking, the coasting trade of
Canada is in a very difficult position because
of foreign competition and conflicts among
various labour unions. Those interested in
the industry are not enthusiastic about its
prospects of the immediate future, and parliament must do its utmost ta provide practical
legislation in this field.
The provisions of this bill are se technical
that it would not be practical te explain them
in the house. It contains many sections dealing with engineering and other technical
problems. The committee of course will
have the benefit of hearing the officers of
the department explain these many features.
But these men are experts in their line, and
certainly no member of the committee
appointed te consider this bill would be
sufficiently qualified te fully understand its
technical provisions. In order te properly
protect those who are engaged in the shipping industry, the committee should have an
expert te advise it as te the effect of these
sections. The fact is that very often the
officials who appear before the committee are
interested in seeing the legislation, as drafted,
passed by parliament, and they are not particularly concerned about the liberty of the
subject. Ample opportunity te be heard
should be given te all shipping concerns and

SENATE
organizations. Those of us who have the
honour to serve on the committee will have
to be most alert to see that the prevailing
practical regulations are not violated by the
new legislation.
With the addition of a tenth province, Newfoundland, coasting trade in Canada has
expanded and taken on a new meaning. It
is my opinion that a young country like
Canada will not progress very rapidly until
her coasting trade is given a chance to build
up under a proper system of protection. As
honourable senators know, the coasting trade
is the nursery of foreign trade.
For these reasons, I hope that the committee which examines this bill will have on
it representatives from the east and west
coasts of Canada and also from the shipping
interests on the Great Lakes. I believe that
the Banking and Commerce Committee is
the one that is most competent to deal with
this bill.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable leader whether the amendments here
proposed are for the purpose of bringing the
Act into conformity with the requirements
of the International Convention?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Many, though not all
of them, are for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable senators, if
this bill is only for the purpose of implementing an international arrangement, I do
not suppose there is much we can do about it;
but it introduces new features which are most
important to the shipping industry.
Speaking for the owners of ships on the
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence, it is my
opinion that the Senate should be allowed
plenty of time to study this measure. Honourable members will remember that the Minister of Transport came before us on a
previous occasion and explained certain proposed changes to the Shipping Act, and members of this body were largely instrumental
in protecting the shipping trade by striking
out clauses that had already been proposed.
We have on the Great Lakes an organization
called the Dominion Marine Association, to
the support of which all ship-owners contribute. The purpose of this organization is
to improve aids to navigation on the St.
Lawrence and the Great Lakes, and also to
watch over and protect the interests of the
ship-owners. I think this Association should
be given plenty of time to study this voluminous measure. It should not be hurried
through. This morning, when the Canada
Grain Act was before the committee, the
people engaged in the grain trade were not
represented, and nobody who had studied

the bill was present on their behalf. I hope
that example will not be followed in this
instance, and that we shall have the opportunity to give this bill plenty of thought.
Hon. Mr. Reid: This bill contains, besides
sixty-three sections covering thirty pages, one
hundred and twenty pages of international
regulations.
Have the various countries
enumerated in the schedule approved these
regulations, and, specifically, has Canada
already agreed to them?

Hon.

Mr.

Robertson:

The

officials

who

represented the government at the original
convention have expressed agreement, subject
of course to the approval of the government
and of parliament. J have not my notes with
me, but my recollection is that the regula-

tions will come into force when fifteen nations
have signified approval, and that up to the
present time three countries-Great Britain,

United States and France-have done so. I
have no knowledge that any other states have
endorsed this convention by parliamentary
process.

I take it that the original convention

was adhered to by a much larger number of
countries.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: I have not read the
bill, but from the observations made here,
particularly those of the honourable senator
from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson), I
gather that it deals with aids to navigation
and the protection of shipping interests. I
wonder why consideration was not given to
the matter of providing a coastguard on both
oceans. I know that representations to this
end have been macle by interests in Nova
Scotia and other Maritime Provinces. When
ships of our own or indeed of any nationality
are disabled or come to grief on our coasts,
we are in the humiliating position of having
to call for aid from the United States. As
the Canada Shipping Act is being amended,
why has the government not given attention
to the establishment of a Canadian coastguard?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The honourable senator
is correct in stating that the bill contains no
provision for the establishment of a Canadian
coastguard, but it is not to be supposed that
the government has not given careful consideration to the question. I believe that in
due course a policy relative to this matter
I do not admit that
will be announced.
services for the safety of life at sea contiguous to Canada are rendered exclusively by the
coastguard of another nation, or that we are
doing very little in this respect. Although
our methods of rescuing life at sea are different from those employed in the United States,
they are not less efficient. I am advised that
if the results are computed in terms of the

JUNE 61 1950
number of rescues of seamen of other countries, the raverse is the case. So there is no
reason to assume that we are in a humiliating
or embarrassing position. Whether our record
in this regard can be stili further improved
is something which, as my honourable friends
suggest, can be carefully considered.

That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by the United States of America of a Convention of delegates from the democracies which
sponsored the North Atlantic treaty and representing the principal political parties of such democracies, for the purpose of exploring how far their
peoples and the peoples of such other democracies
as the Convention may invite to send delegates, can

United Nations, the principles of federal union.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I

hesitate to participate in this debate after
listening to so many splendid speeches, but I

have a few thoughts that I wish to place
before the house. In my opinion the address
by the honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) was particularly fine and
was directed strictly to the motion. Some of
the other speakers were guilty of wandering
-a little-just as I am apt to do.
I should like to commend the honourable
member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) for
placing this resolution before us at this time.
No doubt many honourable senators frequently read that splendid journal, Freedom
& Union. In its last issue it carried a report
by Will Clayton, prominent American businessman, of the discussion between himself
and Senator Smith before a sub-committee of
the United States Senate. As I recall the
article, Mr. Clayton went so far as to advocate
the abolition of all tariff barriers as a means
of helping to establish lasting world peaýce. We
all want to look forward to a world free frorn
war and I am sure everyone is agreed that
the urgency of trying to ensure world peace
is creeping up on us. As the saying goes, "It
is later than you think."
Prior to the last war there were people in

several countries who realized that war would
be inevitable unless something were done
about it. We all remember the Oxford Group
Movement. I remember meeting some of
the members of the group and having a long
talk with one gentleman who came from Scotland. Their theme was that the troubles of
the world were caused by national pride,
which drove people to see and do things in an
antagonistic way. I thought it was particularly
good of the Oxford Group to express their
willingness to accept leadership from citizens
of other countries. I asked them, "Where will
this leadership come from ?" and they replied,
"Perhaps from the East or from the Japanese".
I think, for instance, they mentioned Chiang
Kai-shek. They said they were willing to drop
all nationalistic aims in an effort to make their
scheme a success.
The honourable member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) said he would prefer
to have Canada approve the calling of the
conference suggested in this motion because,
primarily, he thinks the free democratic
countries in Europe today have more confidence in Canada than they have in the United

States. Well, there comes a time when it does
a man good to just search himself to see
how he stands, and I think the same applies
to nations. Seriously, I am doubtful that we
have the right to consider ourselves as highly
thought of by other nations. For instance,
how high a regard will the people of Japan
have for us in view of the treatment handed
out to Japanese Canadians during the war?
Certainly in the eyes of our labour unions
the great crime of these Japanese Canadians
was that they were putting in too many working hours. What right have we to suppose
that the Chinese should hold us in high
esteem, especially in view cf the restrictions
under which we have allowed their countrymen to enter our boundaries?
The honourable gentleman from New Westminster referred-and I thought he was looking right at me when he did so-to the
comparatively small amount of money that
Canada spends on defence and deplored the
fact that a greater amount is spent on liquor.
The whole world today is facing a war of
ideals, so my complaint is that we have the
wrong kind of defence. Considering the contribution in men and material that Canada
made in the last war, I think we missed a
wonderful chance to take an important part
in post-war worild affairs. Our troops are
at Churchill and Dawson, but we should
have had a first-class army of occupation in
Germany. Had we been regarded highly
enough, this opportunity would have been ours.
Such an army could have served two purposes, one of them being to examine immigrants willing to come to this country. Here
we are talking about freedom from want,
freedom frorn fear, and the other principles
laid down by Churchill and Roosevelt. But
there are many different kinds of fear. What
is the fear that is preventing Canada from
admitting a million or two of the people who
have been held in a trap in Eastern Germany?
You may have noticed in the press that
recently some of these people escaped to
Western Germany; but some of their countrymen have no homes other than a concentration
camp and nothing to do but gaze at the
ceiling above their heads. These are the
people who are needed to show others the
democratic way of life. We are in fear of our
labour unions. Through irrigation it is possible to increase tremendously our production
of grain to feed a hungry world; yet fearpolitical fear, if you like, of our labour
unions-prevents us from allowing starving
people to come to this country.
It seems to me that if the world is to be
saved there must be an amalgamation of the
democracies, as proposed in the motion before
us, and that Canada must not only support
the amalgamation but must encourage large

JUNE 6, 1950
numbers of people to come here and help
us to make this a much greater country than
it now is. We often make a lot of noise in
praising Canada and boasting of its glorious
future. But have we the faith that this country can contain and maintain several
million more people? It would be far better
for us to spend money on bringing immigrants to this country than on building up
great defences; but the truth is that we have
no faith, no vision. Instead, we have fear,
only fear.
I listened with much interest to the very
fine address of the honourable gentleman
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), who
spoke of the development of the Roman
Empire; but I waited in vain for him to tell
us why that great empire fell. I believe that
if we studied, the reasons why Rome fell we
would learn a very valuable lesson. When
the empire was at its height the people did
much as we are doing now-they added to
the attractions of their capital city, they
constructed huge viaducts and vast places of
amusement, and their leaders built mansions
for themselves, where they lived in idleness.
They carried on large social experiments and
debated the best use to be made of their land;
but all the time the welfare of great masses
of the people was neglected.
Last week our parliament was visited by a
man who is attempting the tremendous task
of building up a nation in Pakistan, which
was formerly a portion of the Indian empire.
Pakistan is in two parts, separated by 900
miles, and terrible slaughter took place in
the movement of Moslems and Hindus. A
lady friend of mine who was in India thirty
years ago, and is now returning to Pakistan
to assist in extending its hospital and other
health services, showed me a ýpicture of a
little child who was the only one to escape
alive out of a whole trainload of people being
transferred from one part of the country to
the other. He was two years old, and he
owed his life to the fact that he hid in the
corner of a car and was overlookedi when all
the rest were killed. When we hear of such
tragedies we sometimes flatter ourselves that
we can set these people a good example; but
they would find it rather strange that in this
country, which is supposed. to be united, we
maintain two systems of schools in order that
our children when growing up may be
educated in separate groups.
I am sorry that there is not freedom for
anyone to express his views on political subjects anywhere in the world, and I personally
regret very much that there was interference
at some of the meetings addressed in this
country recently by the so-called "Red

Dean". I wish conditions were such that he
could come here and speak freely-if he so
desires-in favour of the Russian way of
life, and that anyone from Canada could be
free to go to Russia and there praise the
Canadian way of life. There does not appear
to be much hope for that kind of thing in
the near future, but now and then I do see
an encouraging item in the press. The other
day, for instance, I read that the British parliament voted an annual pension of £200 to
Willie Gallacher, a communist and former
member of the House of Commons at Westminster. For a long time he was a thorn in
the flesh to the British government, but as he
was defeated in his campaign for re-election
and came to be in need, he was given a
pension. That is the British method of
treating him.
Sometimes the items that one comes across
in the press are rather curious. The other day
I saw it suggested that while Rome burned
Nero was not fiddling, but was playing the
bagpipes.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Take it easy.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: No wonder Rome
burned!
Hon. Mr. Horner: In speaking in this debate
the honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) said we needed a fervent
religious movement. That is true, but I do
not think he would advocate that everybody
should go so far in demonstrating their
religious beliefs as some Dukhobors in his
province have gone. I wish to point out that
the Dukhobors at Blaine Lake, where I come
from, are well behaved and do not adopt such
extreme measures as have been taken in
British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is colder at Blaine
Lake.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I wonder if part of the
explanation is to be found in the people that
the Dukhobors associate with in British
Columbia. Perhaps, for example, some Dukhobors out on the coast heard Scotsmen
playing a certain musical instrument and
resented it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I doubt that any Dukhobors
would disrobe if they were taken up to the
Arctic.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Seriously, though, I am
glad to support the motion. Recently I read
an article which stated that in the last ten
years the world's population has increased
by 200 millions, whereas food production has

dropped by 3 per cent. In these circumstances it is not hard to see that if we wish
to be called Christians we should share more
of our heritage with people who are cramped
for living space and lack adequate food. If I
were in favour of continuing the old policy
of exclusion I should be ashamed to stand
up and boast of Canada or to call myself a
Canadian.
Not only do I support the present motion,
but I would support any motion advocating
international union, even political union, if
thereby war could be prevented. The ideal
is "that man to man, the world o'er, shall
brothers be." That is the condition I should
like to see brought about, and if we are not
working for that I am afraid we are headed
for trouble.

than I can.

He said: Honourable senators, this motion,
of which I gave notice on the 24th of May, is

seconded by the honourable gentleman from
Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Veniot).
For quite a few years I have intended to
bring this matter before the Senate, but I did
not sec any urgency to do so until it became
necessary.
Last session, when speaking on
proposed amendments to our constitution, I
briefly referred to this question of consent
of the provinces to any such amendments, and
expressed the opinion that some consents had

not been legally expressed.
After my last address, I received fron
Montreal copies of l'Action Nationale, a
periodical published there, and a copy of Rev.
Father Richard Ares' pamphlet containing all
his articles on La Confederation:Pact ou Loi?
Both the periodical l'Action Nationale and the
pamphlet of Rev. Father Ares are, I am told,
widely circulated among our professional
French Canadians, and more especially the
young students at universities, colleg-es and
seminaries in the province of Quebec and some
other provinces.
I read the following from page 209 of
l'Action Nationale, No. 3, November, 1949,
and from page 18 of La Confederation: Pacte
ou Loi? by Rev. Father Ares. The original is
in

French, and I translate:
Also, the 1940 amendment respecting unemployment insurance was preceded by consultations with
the provinces, and Ottawa, before taking action,
even awaited the approval of the province of
Quebec. Only when unanimity was obtained did it
ask London to amend the constitution.
Therefore, it is wrong to assert, as some people
did recently, that the provinces were never consulted or never took part in the amendments, since
1867. It is true that the central power proceeded to
constitutional amendments without always taking
into account the viewpoints of the provinces; but
this mode of action always caused deep concern in
the province of Quebec, if not in other provinces.

MOTION

Hon. Arthur Marcotte moved:
That in the opinion of the Senate, whenever an
amendment to the Constitution of Canada is made,
or is to be made, requiring the consent of one or

these two citations:
Mr. Mackenzie King, the then Prime Minister,
gave himself credit for having obtained this unanimous consent. He said:
We have avoided anything in the nature of
coercion of any of the provinces. Moreover, we
have avoided the raising of a very critical constitutional question, namely, whether or not in amending the British North America Act it is absolutely
necesary to secure the consent of alil the provinces,
or whether the consent of a certain number of provinces would of itself be sufficient . . . For the
present at any rate we have escaped any pitfall in
that direction.
That extract is taken from the House of
Commons Debates of June 25, 1940, pages 117

and 118.
If these statements are not contradicted
they will have the force of precedent.

JUNE 7, 1950
Further, in the near future some conferences
will take place between this government and
the provinces to discuss amendments to our
constitution, and the provinces will have to
give consent before the proposed amendments
can be adopted. The amendments may involve the reform of the Senate, and it may
become vitally important to this chamber
that the needed consent of the provinces to
such reform be proper and valid. Thus a
discussion of this motion will prove useful,
and I invite the honourable senators Who
take an interest in these matters to express
their opinions.
I shall now try to prove to honourable
senators that one of the most important
duties of the Senate-in my opinion the most
important-is to protect the rights of the
provinces against any encroachments by the
federal government, and when the consent
of the provinces is needed for amendments
to our constitution, to prevent the giving of
improper and illegal consent by the executive
of the provinces.
Honourable senators, I will not burden my
address and tire you with citations of what
was said by the Fathers of Confederation in
reference to the Senate. You know your
constitutional law and authorities better than
I do. I will just cite what was said in the
Senate by former members.
I now quote from the speech of the late
Senator Murphy as follows:
In order to protect local interests, and to prevent
sectional jealousies, it was found requisite that the
three great divisions into which British North
America is separated should be represented in the
Upper House on the principle of equality. Accordingly, in the Upper House-which has the sober
second thought in legislation-it is provided that
each of those great sections shall be represented
equally by twenty-four members.
There would be no use of an upper house if It
did not exercise, when it thought proper, the right
of opposing, or amending, or postponing, the legislation of the lower house. It would be of no value
whatever were it a mere chamber for registering the
decrees of the lower house. It.must be an independent bouse having a free action of its own, for it
is only valuable as being a regulating body, calmly
considering the legislation initiated by the popular
branch, and preventing any hasty or ill-considered
legisIation which may come from that body.
The three great divisions of the country to which
Sir John Macdonald referred were Ontario, Quebec
and the Maritime provinces. Each of these being
represented by 24 members made the initial membership of the Senate 72. This number was later
increased to 96 by the representation given to new
provinces.

The other duties of the Senate have been
fully covered in the addresses of the late
Senators Murphy and Bench, and more
recentýly by the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), the honourable
senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross), and
many others who have either spoken or

written on the matter. The work of the
Senate has been fully described, and according to the late Honourable Senator Murphy
it has saved the country more than $110
million. The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) in his recent articles
estimated the amount that this house has
saved for the western farmer at some $700
million.
On Tuesday, October 30, 1945, in an
address to this house on the powers of the
Senate generally I referred especially to its
power to amend, and even to reject, money
bills coming from the other place, and I
cited therein the authorities with respect to
the powers of the Senate. I will repeat today
some of the citations made use of in that
address to prove that if we enjoy powers
we also have duties to perform.
We have been told and have read tnany
times that one of the duties of the Senate
is to protect the provinces. Let me give
the evidence of the truth of this.
I quote from the memorandum prepared for
the Senate by the committee appointed in
1918, at page 197:
There are five things that are new-age, property,
residence, life tenure and the fixed number. In the
old provincial constitutions these are not found. In
those above mentioned (1791) and (1840) a councillor was required only to be a British subject
twenty-one years of age.
The statute shows a fundamental difference between the Senate and the House of Lords.
Then the Senate is an upper house in a federation
and not in a unitary state or legislative union as in
the House of Lords. The Senate is more like that
of the United States or the upper house in Germany
or Switzerland. If it is not the first duty of the
Senate to protect provincial interests, it is impossible not to infer from the terms of the Act that
this is a duty cast upon It. Why else the appointment by provinces and electoral districts with the
qualifications of property and residence? Why not
an appointment to the Senate simply as in the House
of Lords or the nominated legislative council
already referred to? Such fundamental changes are
not made for nothing. The first duty of the Senate
is to protect and preserve provincial rights and
interest. No such duty is required of the House of
Lords or of any of the legislative councils in the
provinces. More than that from the Act it Is quite
clear that to enable the Senate to do this it was
made an independent body by the abolition of the
"swamping power" and making the tenure of the
position for life. It has, of course, other powers
and duties consequent on its being an independent
part of the constitution.
The constitution of the Senate as already outlined
is fundamentally different from the House of Lords
and its functions of safeguarding provincial Interests
in a federal system is one unknown to an upper
bouse in a unitary system as In the House of Lords.
Then the Senate is in a measure representative,
although nominated. This is brought about by the
property and residence qualifications of senators.
The division of the dominion into senatorial districts differentiates the two upper houses. The
senators first of all represent their provinces or
districts and their first duty is to them. Then the

The correspondence shows that the provinces finally agreed, in the way I have just
mentioned, to the proposed amendment to
the B.N.A. Act. The two provinces which
passed resolutions in their local legislatures
were New Brunswick and British Columbia.
Paragraph 5 of the resolution passed in the

Minister of Justice in his usual able manner said:
"He proposed, in these regulations, to establish
the principle that legislation on matters affecting
this country should only be undertaken, by the
Imperial Government, when sought for by the
people of this country, through their representatives. This principle became of still greater consequence when legislation sought for was of a
character which would alter in a material point the
compact upon which the union itself was formedwhich violated, in its most important ingredient,
the question of the distribution of power-to reintroduce the former evils from which the people
of old Canada suffered, and which led to the
introduction of the constitution under which we
now lived. Not only that, but that it should be done
at the instance of a minister of the Crown, when
there was nothing to prevent them from asking the
people of this country, through their representatives,
what change, if any, should be made in the constitution of the country. That a minister of the crown
under such circumstances should have ventured to
apply to the Home Government, and should have
sent home a draft of a bill which they asked Earl
Kimberley to make law, was without precedent,
without parallel, without excuse, without palliation.
He asked the bouse te agree that it was their duty
to take care that they should determine what legislation the Imperial Parliament be asked to enact
on their behalf. Honourable gentlemen opposite
might say that the sense of the Parliament of
Canada had already been taken on the bill.
Sir George E. Cartier: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Blake thought that was the paltry
evasion they would make, but he would tell them
that the draft sent to England went far beyond the
Manitoba Bill.
The question was whether the people were prepared to surrender into the hands of the government of the day, that power which the government
of the day was assuming it possessed-the power to
ask the Imperial Parliament to make laws for us;
or whether the house did not think that every
sense of duty called upon them to determine that
their sense-that was the sense of the people-was
to be taken upon, and was to form the basis of that
Imperial legislation.
Sir Alexander T. Galt spoke in the same strain,
and thought that the government, before taking the
vote, should consider whether it would not be
better to decide that for ail time to come no change
should bo made in the British North America Act,
except in the usual approved mode of address to the
Queen.
Hon. Mr. Holton had remarked that, if the government could take such action with reference to an
unimportant measure, there was no reason why this
could not be done with regard to the most
important.
Mr. Speaker (who then had a seat on the floor
of this House), had expressed his views in his usual
trenchant manner, and had ably indicated the right
of the house to ask for any legislation which was
to be undertaken.
Hon. Mr. Holton then moved, seconded by Hon.
Alexander Mackenzie, -and this bouse is of opinion
that no changes in the provisions of the British
North America Act should be sought for by the
executive government without the previous assent
of the parliament of this dominion.

The vote was: Yeas, 137; nays, none."
If the action that the government had taken were
permitted with reference to unimportant matters,
the power might be assumed in regard to questions
of extreme importance to the country. It was to
be remembered that parliament was actually in
session when this violation of the constitution
occurred. They had read for the first time this day
a bill sent down from the Senate, to enable witnesses to be examined on oath before both houses
of parliament.
In 1873 parliament passed an Act to enable committees of both houses to administer oaths to witnesses; and it was disallowed, thus ceasing to be
law. Yet in this Act they actually found that the
Imperial Parliament was legislating for Canada. He
would like to learn the opinion of the Minister of
Justice regarding this matter. They had gone
further and added this clause:
"The Act of the Parliament of Canada, passed in
the 31st year of the reign of Her Majesty, Chapter
24, entitled: An Act to provide for oaths to witnesses being administered in certain cases for the
purpose of either house of parliament, shall be
deemed to be valid, and to have been valid as
from the date in which the Royal Assent was given
thereto by the Governor General of the Dominion
of Canada."
The Imperial Parliament had no right to legislate
in this manner, without the previous assent of the
Parliament of Canada. In order that some record
might be had of this circumstance, he moved,
seconded by Mr. Bowell:
"That it appears from papers laid before this
bouse, that the executive government by order in
council passed on the 18th of February, 1875, while
this house was in session, recommending the passage
of an Imperial Act, to remove aIl doubts as to the
right of the parliament of this dominion to possess
the power of passing an Act, providing for the
examination of witnesses on oath, by members of
the Senate and the House of Commons;
That in pursuance of such recommendation, the
Imperial Parliament passed an Act, Chapter 38,
Victoria 38 and 39, whereby section 18 of the British
North America Act of 1867 was repealed, and
another section was substituted for the section
which was repealed;
That this house on the 27th of March, 1871, on
motion of Hon. L. H. Holton, and seconded by the
Hon. A. Mackenzie, had resolved as follows: And
this bouse is of opinion that no change in the
provisions of the British North America Act should
be sought for by the executive government without
the previous assent of the parliament of this
dominion; that the previous assent of the Parliament of Canada to the change in the provisions of
the British North America Act sought for by the
order in council as aforesaid was not obtained; and
that this house regrets that any imperial legislation
affecting the British North America Act of 1867
should have been sought by the executive government without the previous assent of the Parliament
of Canada expressed in the usual manner by
addresses from both houses of parliament to Her
Most Gracious Majesty the Queen."
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie: As to the general principle
enunciated by the honourable gentleman, of course
he gave his entire assent to it, but there was a
great difference between the two cases cited.

I close this long citation at this point
because the motion was finally withdrawn,

Honourable senators, you are not elected,
you are not called; you are selected to give
assistance and advice in affairs of the state,
and you are commanded to leave everything
aside and to be here at all times, and this you
are in no wise to omit. For so doing you
receive, not a salary but an "indemnity",
which is the statutory word, and the right one.
I am the humblest member of the Senate,
but I speak of these duties with an easy conscience. In less than one month it will be
nincteen years since I was commanded to be
here. I am certified by our treasury officer,
who is in charge of our attendance records,
as having been absent only thirty days in
those nineteen years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: During my long life I
have travelled a lot; I have attended many

meetings of men, in legislatures, parliaments,
chambers of commerce, universities, and other
bodies, in Canada and elsewhere; and let me
assure you that I have never met a finer
group of men than those I have known during
my nineteen years in this chamber-men of
learning, of wisdom, of knowledge of the
needs of this country; men imbued with the
desire to serve Canada and Canadians. These
men have won my admiration for their talents
and learning; they have earned my esteem
for their honesty of purpose and keen interest
in the affairs of our country. In appreciation
of their fine personal qualities, I have given
them my affection. After all, we are only
human beings, and we have made mistakesas a wise old Roman philosopher once said,
Errare humanum est. But we are men of
good will, and to such has been promised
peace on earth and in all eternity. We begin
our deliberations each day with a prayer to
God because we believe in God; we are doing
our work with the will to be useful te our
country and to our fellow citizens. And this
is our right. Having conscientiously fulfilled our mission, we can leave this chamber
and say to each other and to outsiders as
well: Honi soit qui mal y pense.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.

The motion was agreed to.
LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT
REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the first report of the Joint Committee of
both houses on the Library of Parliament.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved concurrence in the report.
He said: Honourable senators, I feel that
a few words should be said in explanation

of this report. It contains some minor recommendations with which the house is familiar,
but does not entirely reflect the discussion
on the question of a national library, which
took place at the meeting. The urgent need
for more library space was recognized and
emphasized by all members of the comrnmittee.
The proposed national library, about which
there has been much general discussion,
should not be confused with the Library of
Parliament. The so-called Massey Commission, which has heard representations on a
wide range of subjects, will no doubt include
in its report certain findings as to the establishment of a national library. The Library
of Parliament and to some extent the Public
Archives, have been performing the funetions of a national library and, for reference
purposes, have been meeting the needs of the
members of both houses. The point has now
been reached when cthe very excellent services of the personnel of the library are
inexpressibly embarrassed by reason of limited space and lack of facilities necessary to
the operation of a good library. The library's
immediate need for storage space is being met
by the use of accommodation in the basement
of the Supreme Court Building, but this is
only a temporary expedient.
On behalf of the library officials and staff,
the members of both houses of parliament
-nd other interested persons, I wish again
te emtphasize the urgent need for greater
facilities in the Library of Parliament.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
personally I am not opposed to this report; but
when the question of a national library is
under 'consideration by a royal commission I
cannot quite undersitand why a joint committee of parliament should also review the
matter and ask us to adopt a recommendation on this very question. I may be under
some misapprehension, but I fail to see the
purpose of such a report. If the report of the
Massey Commission, when made, contains a
recommendation as to a national library, we
can then concur in or reiect that part of the
report. On the question before us I shall
vote "No", the reason being that I do not
want to be bound by a report of a parliamentary committee in advance of the report
of a royal commission.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: With the permission of
honourable senators, I should like to reply to
leader
honourable
of the
the remarks
opposite.
By way of explanation I may say that the
question of establishing a national library
arose out of an earlier meeting of the joint
committee, the minutes of which contained
an account of a discussion of this subject. The
members of the joint committee feel that they

JUNE 7, 1950
should re-emphasize the representations previously made. I -can quite appreciate the
feeling of the honourable leader opposi.te that
this subject is to some extent sub judice.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It certainly is.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Many representations
have been made in public places outside of
parliament during the course of the sitting
of the royal 'commission, but I do not think
the commission has in any way been embarrassed by such discussion. The fact is that
the early establishment of a national library
would relieve the pressure in the Parliamentary Library, and to that extent it is a
matter of real concern to those who wish to
give the library officials the facilities necessary for better service.
Hon. Thomas Reid: As one of the members
of the Library Committee, perhaps I may add
a word about the remarks of the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). It is true
that a royal commission is dealing with this
subject, and probably it will recommend the
establishment of a national library. But the
fact remains that the Library Committee has
viewed the matter from an entirely different
point of view.
The Library of Parliament was instituted
many years ago, and in the course of time it
has accumulated thousands upon thousands
of books. The collection is now so vast that
no member of parliament nor any senator
could begin ta go over it, let alone read it
all; and the Library Committee, in view of
the increasing demand from all over Canada
for the right of access to and examination of
these volumes, bas been thinking of the use
to which the surplus could be put rather than
of the principle of a national library. For
years representations have been made that
the great number of valuable books which
are never looked at þy members of the Commons or of the Senate should be transferred
to some building, there to form the nucleus
of a national library. Hence, the committee's
recommendation is directed to a purpose
very different from that of the Royal Commission, which in the interests of Canada as a
whole is considering the advisability of having
a national library.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it your pleasure to adopt the report?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: On division?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. I want to be recorded
as "No". Not "On division"; just "No".
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That cannot be recorded
unless the honourable senator stands.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it can. You watch the
record.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
CONVENTION OF NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by the United States of America of a Convention of delegates from the democracies which
sponsored the North Atlantic treaty and representing the principal political parties of such democracies, for the purpose of exploring how far their
peoples and the peoples of such other democracies
as the Convention may invite to send delegates, can
apply among them within the framework of the
United Nations, the principles of federal union.

Hon. Athanase David: Honourable senatôrs,
I believe that this house owes a debt of
gratitude and an expression of thanks to the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) for having brought before this house
this resolution, the subject matter of which
is one of the most important that has ever
been submitted to the Senate of Canada. One
must have no lack of temerity and an
absolute lack of moçlesty and humility who
dares to speak after the most elaborate
addresses which have already been made on
this motion; yet I think certain aspects of it
have not been touched, and it is on these
that I intend to focus the attention of honourable senators.
If this motion were asking for a definite
and compulsory endorsement of a federation
of Europe or of democracies, I would be
reluctant to speak, knowing quite well the
objections to which such a proposal might
give rise, but which would not in the least
change my own opinion. However, the
object of the resolution is merely to have
Canada take part in a convention of delegates of the democracies, so I do not think
that it could give rise to insurmountable
objections. Like myself, and perhaps better
than 1, you have no doubt realized long since
that having witnessed the decline of an era,
we are on the threshold of a new one. WilI
the new era be better or worse? Time alone
will tell. Will the inspiration which comes
sometimes from the past, and the light which
it throws on the present, be sufficient to
enable us to avoid the pitfalls in the path
which a new world is called upon to tread?
The future alone will tell. Sometimes, thinking of what has been the moral discipline of
our western civilization in the past century,
I feel forced to ask myself if we have not in
a certain degree helped the Karl Marx

SENATE
ideology to permeate the masses. Has not
limitless industrialization, when the hand of
the worker is no more the servant of his
intelligence, created a new form of labour in
which man's thought, ability, courage and will
have been replaced by soulless machinepower and outward dynamic energy?
There was a time on earth when work was
an ideal, when it was loved, when it
developed initiative which became a pleasure,
when not to work was a disgrace, when
everyone who wanted to obey the rules
could work, and when the article made by
hand reflected the artistic taste or the craft
of the maker. Then was the time when man
could glorify his work. Christian morality,
although not accepted everywhere and by
everyone, yet was a beacon whose light was
projected on a standard of life. Nowadays
it is the machine that does the work, and the
worker's great mission in this world is to see
that the machine is in condition to replace
him.
The disintegration has been the result of
the trespassing on a truth that Edmund
Burke enunciated when he said that liberty
"cannot exist without order and virtue."
When this lack of order exists, disfiguring
the last remnants of virtue. discipline
becomes a nonentity, and the state intervenes
to force it upon those whom it has the responsibility of guiding. Then is born discontent:
and it is on this discontent that Marx counted
most to impose his murky and monstrous
faith.
It is therefore the duty of the West to put
its own house in order, and it is also for us of
the West to renew our moral community.
Among notes of my readings I found the
following taken from a book called There's
Freedom for the Brave.
We must come to understand that morality is
really essential to the solution of moral problems.
Community cannot be founded on negatives or fear
or some temporary alignment. Man even in his
work does not live by bread alone. His nature is
not wholly filled or expressed in the production
and consumption of bread and beer and radio sets
and patent medicines. He has not his answer or his
end in these. They cannot ease his discontent.

To give man in the machine age the end
and the answer he is looking for and aspiring to, capitalism must realize that it is more
than time for it "to get itself a conscience".
This, I believe, conforms to the dictates of
sane sociology and the doctrine of Christian
justice.
Having said this I come now to the subject
matter before us. There is no doubt that one
thing only will put an end to what we have
humorously called the cold war: it is the fear
which may some day grip those in the Kremlin and their satellites that they might lose a

bloody war. This sense of fear must have
been provoked to some degree by the recent
events which have taken place in France and
Italy, and in certain parts of invaded China.
In France, the political strikes organized
by the communist party seem to have failed.
Thus, at the well-known Renault Automobile
plant, the. number of employees who formerly
paid dues to the communist pprty declined
within a month from 7,000 to 2,000. I believe
it may be concluded that Moscow, through
lack of psychological insight, has caused the
cup to overflow by organizing the strikes
which have caused so much distress in French
family circles.
In Italy, the communists' efforts have
merely enabled Mr. DeGasperi to apply the
land reforrn which he had advocated for so
long, and to divide one and one-half million
"hectares" of large, unproductive estates,
called "Latifundia", between 200,000 families
of agricultural workers, thus increasing the
acreage of farm lands as well as agricultural
production.
In China, it is a well known fact that the
Russians, by seizing the agricultural output
of a large part of the occupied territory, thus
causing 45 million Chinese to feel the pangs
of hunger, have aroused the anger of the
Chinese people. In addition, Mao has compelled the Chinese to perform a vast amount of
slave labour. Therefore, in this respect it
may be stated that, as in Yugoslavia, the
brand of communism originating in Moscow,
with Stalin and the Politburo, has met with
difficulties.
But let us for a moment disregard this
hope, which may be illusory, and let us face
the facts as they appear to the man in the
street.
Certain countries which not so many years
ago regarded socialism as a step forward in
politics and based their governmental policies
on such a doctrine, have suddenly abandoned
this false love and are returning to more sane
and conservative politics. Do I need to mention what has happened in Australia, New
Zealand, South Africa and in the last elections
in England? In England the communist party
has decreased in strength to such an extent
that Mr. Herbert Morrison could declare,
without being contradicted by anyone on the
other side, that the communist party is not
a political party, but merely conspiracy. I
shall not take the time of the house to mention
other countries which today are contermplating
outlawing the communist party and communism itself.
There is no doubt whatsoever that Stalin,
reviving the imperialistic dreams of Paul and

JUNE 7, 1950
Catherine of Russia, is seeking world domination by fomenting troubles in various countries in both hemispheres. It is but the return
of the age-old ambition which has existed
since creation, and which the Phoenicians,
the Greeks, the Romans, the Germans have
successively pursued in order ta rule the whole
world.
But nowadays this is not such a simple matter in a world where space and distance no
longer exist and where oceans are no longer
an obstacle.
If Charles the Fifth and
Napoleon succeeded in dominating the world
simply by conquering the West, today it is
necessary ta dominate not only the West but
the whole world. Caesar, Charlemagne and,
even more so, Genghis Khan, were certainly
possessed of great courage and a genius to
undertake, support and maintain their conquests. Indeed, the difficulties of communication and the slight scientific knowledge
possessed by man in their times created
serious problems which are easily overcome
by today's conquerors.
The method used ta conquer peoples has
entirely changed. It is by disturbing minds
and poisoning consciences, by suppressing
morals and religion, by resorting to shameless
lies and refusing ta listen ta grievances,
by destroying honesty and bribing people ta
become disloyal, that today's leader prepares
tomorrow's world .conquest. All the while,
unlike conquerors of the past, he remains
invisible in an impregnable fortress. It is
unnecessary for him ta expose himself ta any
dangers; his fifth column, working underground in every country, does his work. This
new strategy and the fears which it causesfears that stem from troubled minds and the
dissatisfaction of people reduced ta bondage,
the hunger of many thousands in devastated
countries and the deterioration of morals
evident everywhere--have, however, forced
the civilized people of the Western nations to
realize that as individuals they can do little,
but that united they may preserve their dignity
as human beings and their freedom as citizens.
This is why the awakened democracies do
not wish ta fall among "mediocracies."
The prophecy of Napoleon Bonaparte-made
at the time, if I am not mistaken, when he
was First Consul of France-to the effect that
"in one hundred years Europe will be a
republic or it will be overrun by Cossacks", is
thought-provoking. One hundred years later,
the democracies realize that Napoleon was
right. They still believe in freedom and are
ready to make all the necessary sacrifices in
order ta direct their efforts, slowly perhaps
but surely, towards the establishment of some
form of federation: while in the East, Russia
and her satellites believe only in force and
the powers of absorption.

It may interest honourable senators ta know
that the diary of Victor Hugo, that great poet
who occupied the limelight in France throughout nearly all the nineteenth century, has just
been delivered for publication. On the 28th of
November, 1875-the year in which, if I
remember rightly, he had returned from
exile-he was host at dinner ta Gambetta,
Spuller, Lockroy and Castelor, and after their
departure he wrote these words:
I drank a toast to the United States of the South,
awaiting the moment when I can drink one to the
United States of Europe.

I have spoken of "some form of federation".
Obviously the term "federation" implies necessarily at least the partial relinquishment of a
nation's rights or sovereignty. Anthony Eden
stated not long ago:
I cannot for the life of me see any definite solution unless there is a weakening of our present
notion of sovereignty. It is necessary to remove in
some way the sting of nationalism.

This is a statement by a man who was
long entrusted with the protection of his
country's sovereignty, and who now realizes
that only by relinquishing at least part of their
sovereignty or delegating some of their powers
to a higher authority will the nations which
have not as yet been subjugated be able ta
survive. Men who heretofore were unalterably opposed ta any relinquishment or diminution of sovereignty and who, on the contrary,
strove ta increase it-and who could blame
them?-realize perhaps with some regret that
this omnipotence, this absolute power, this
isolationism is no longer possible. André
Siegfried, political thinker, admirable lecturer
and first-class writer, states in his book
"The Sauls of Peoples", at page 16:
Athens, notwithstanding its limited territory, had
succeeded in dominating the Mediterranean, owing
to its elite citizens; our thirty or forty million people
were formerly sufficient to ensure the domination of
Europe, but now the mass replaces the unit; this Is
the reason why the United States and the U.S.S.R.,
real continents, are displacing in the direction of
our planet the "small Asiatic cape" so marvellously
limited and diversified, if lacking in bulk, which had
led the world for four hundred years.

And he adds:
Those units which are no longer able to cope with
this new era must of necessity form a federation.
Ruined, down-trodden, territorially-reduced Europe
can no longer play the role of leader of Western
civilization, or ensure, as it did for several centuries,
the development of our planet.

I have quoted this excerpt in order ta show
the present trend of French thought, of which
I believe André Siegfried ta be one of the
most forceful and fluent exponents.
You may say that the creation of a federation involves the creation of a new power.
And so it does. But let me explain that there
is a slight difference, for it goes without saying that in the case of this newly-established

SENATE

body the representatives or delegates cannot
go beyond their mandate. But if this new
power is given the specific form of a higher
government, in which each country is equitably and adequately represented, then in truth
a super-government is created. I am aware
of and understand the many misgivings to
which an undertaking of this kind may give
rise. But do not the same conditions exist
in any well-organized society where a central, higher or supreme authority is required?
Thus humans, being what they are-that is
perfectible but not perfect-must of necessity be subject to some moral and civil laws
in order to insure order and discipline. If
men were perfect, they would be justified in
refusing to submit to any law. The same
principle applies to nations, which after all
are composed of groups of human beings, and
therefore prefectible but not perfect. Does it
not follow, then, that among the nations there
should be a nucleus vested with authority,
recognized by everyone and acting for the
community of nations in the same way as the
legislative authority in an ordinary society
acts for the community of citizens?
The modern state as we understand it
today, endowed with the sovereignty everyone so admires, goes back only to the Treaties
of Westphalia, figured around 1648, I believe.
Since the inception of the modern state the
idea of peace, the desire to live at home in
peace, has grown constantly; but since 1648,
and even today as I speak, is not the world
subject to the hopes and fears of the people
represented by these governments of such
states?
I am not unaware that if there are warlike
nations there are also peace-loving nations;
but I think I can assert without fear of being
contradicted, that even the most peaceful
nations are not indifferent to the conquest of
riches which, unfortunately, have so often
in the past caused them to abandon the substance in order to pursue the shadow. The
scourge of war is chronic, and notwithstanding the lessons of the past-such as the wars
of 1870, 1914 and 1939-we have not yet
learned that often there are neither conquerors nor conquered, and that the so-called
conquerors of yesterday often become the
tyrants of tomorrow. The unbridled thirst
for riches is still the cancer which kills
nations. Someone, whose name I cannot
recall, said: "Nations do not die, they kill
themselves." How true! How many countries, drawn by the hope of enriching thernselves, by the hope of conquest and of finding gold, have thrown themselves into wars
which left them much poorer and, if not
ruined, reduced to the point of being incapable of pursuing their historical mission.

In any well-organized society the man who
harms another may be called upon by his
victim to redress the wrong he has caused or
to face the civil or criminal courts, which are
intended to help the man who has been
wronged, or punish the wrongdoer. Nations
do not scem to be subject to this rule of justice. An aggressor nation which commits a
wrong may well lose the respect of the other
nations for some time, or may even be
required to pay certain reparations; but there
will always be found, besides the injured
nation, other countries that would profit by
the renewed prosperity of the aggressor and
which would endeavour to create obstacles to
the execution of the treaty or agreement, so
that the country attacked remains handicapped for many years and, as I said before,
incapable of pursuing its destiny.
Would that be the case if a higher bodyholding authority over every nation and
including delegates from each-a body whose
absolute authority could not be ignored and
whose decision would be irrevocable, took
command? Such an authority would be
powerful enough to control national ambitions, selfish and nationalistic interests, and
the inordinate desire of nations for expansion
by conquest or absorption.
Let there be no misunderstanding over
what I have said. I stated earlier, and I
repeat, that as distance affords no protection
and oceans are no longer an obstacle, there
are no more safeguards against international
conflict. In other words, isolation or isolationism, to which certain nations used to
resort, cannot exist today. The progress of
modern science, whether in the field of rail,
air and steamship transportation or of
telephone and radio communication, has compressed the globe into a small world indeed;
and -by making contact so much easier it has
increased the impact of conflict which can no
longer be confined to one state, because as
soon as one state is in danger the whole structure of the world is shaken.
In a well written article, Roger Chaput
recently said:
It is common knowledge today that the maintenance of Western civilization is closely connected
with the maintenance of peace.
All who stop to think over the matter, be
they politicians or others, believe that in

order to save our democratic civilization and
ensure peace and order there must be established a higher authority, recognized by all
the states, who will agree to forego in its
favour the sovereignty which today they
seem to hold more dear than peace itself.

JUNE 7, 1950
This is hardly the time to go into any
details regarding the membership of such a
government, if it were established, and I do
not intend to broach the subject.
I very humbly submit that I have now
reached the first conclusion, which to my
mind is this: Just as it is essential to limit
the freedom of the individual in a community
to the end that order may be maintained, so
is it essential that the countries desirous of
maintaining peace in the world hand over,
either directly or by delegation, part of their
sovereignty-that is, of their powers-to a
higher authority which is capable of ensuring peaceful international relations.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. David: Is it not true that the
sovereignty of which they are so proud, far
frorn inducing the leaders of states to pursue
the peace which would assure the greatness
and welfare of their peoples, has often
whetted their appetite for martial, economic
or political conquest in the hope of increasing this sovereignty? This desire for supremacy has been abetted by industrial advances
new in history and which have given individuals a standard of life hitherto unknown.
It also seems to have had the effect of
stimulating in the field of weapons discoveries which astonish the mind and go far
beyond the former data of human science.
This sense of sovereignty has presided over
the preparation of treaties, pacts and alliances, where each party, after having exposed
its claims and its wishes, agreed upon minimum conditions in order to lend a certain
efficacy to its signature. However, treaties,
pacts, alliances have proved only one thing:
how easily they may be violated.
Moreover, is not this sense of sovereignty
what has created such scepticism among the
most sincere and cultured diplomats? Even
the United Nations Charter has upheld the
sovereignty of nations, but no one foresaw
that this confirmed sovereignty, expressed
through the right of veto, would force from
ten to twenty sovereign nations to bow to one
single nation. It will be admitted freely, I
expect, that we have here, to say the least,
a ridiculous form of sovereignty. Need I
press my point any further?
The Assembly of the United Nations may,
through one of their members, present such
resolutions as they see fit, and these resolutions may be accepted or rejected by the
states themselves. However, the Assembly
being devoid of legislative powers, none of
the resolutions can become law; so that, even
if adopted, these resolutions will be dependent upon the parliamentary pleasure of the
states concerned. The United Nations charter, I readily admit, does anticipate the

creation of an international police force; it
even provides for the setting up of a General
Staff. Still I am not aware that either of
these projects bas ever assumed the form
of a final agreement. Because of the opposition of Russia and her satellites, wishes have
remained mere wishes.
Can we find anywhere in the world an
instance of a state having relinquished its
sovereignty to a central authority? I do not
think so. The four conventions of the PanAmerican League-held at Panama in 1826,
at Lima in 1847, at Santiago in 1856 and at
Lima again in 1864-although they tried to
establish a federation of South American
countries, merely brought forth the statement which can be found in the Charter of
American Nations drafted at Bogota on April
28, 1948. Section 5 of this charter states:
International order resides essentially
respect of the sovereignty of nations.

in

the

Consequently, neither in America nor in
Europe have the nations been willing to date
to sacrifice an iota of their sovereignty,
although this sacrifice alone could be a guarantee of world peace. Were we to delve a
little further, we should find that the Arab
League, in the same manner and with the
same means, ratifies all that is absolute in
sovereignty when it states:
In the case of a conflict, the decision of the council
could not be binding when such a conflict affects
the independence. the sovereignty or the territorial
integrity of one of the parties involved.

Therefore the second conclusion is that,
so long as the principle of sovereignty continues to be asserted in this manner, it is
useless to think that nations will not try to
take justice into their own hands, and thereby
reject any plan tending to place their sovereign rights under an authority foreign to
their own.
Honourable senators, while listening to my
words as I delve into the past, you will
wonder to what extent the peoples of the
world have remained attached to their sovereignty and whether it is appropriate to
discuss a federation at the present time. I
think it is. If the creation of a unitarian
world state-I might even say a Utopia-is
impossible today, a federation which would
merely bring about a division of power
between a central government and all member
states is neither an impossibility nor a dream.
I know that many plans have failed in days
gone by. I recall, for instance, that of the
French monk Cruce, in 1648, and that drafted
by Sully sixteen years later, in 1664. However, since the end of the second Great War,
those countries which have favoured a federal
state have become so numerous that once
more we can hope to see this plan come into
being. Even the man in the street seems to

SENATE
be interested in this new body of United
Nations. The United World Federation has
at least 34,000 adherents. France for one is
represented by nineteen groups in the international committee for uniting all movements tending to a European unity. Duncan
Sandys, a son-in-law of Winston Churchill, is
secretary to this committee. Numerous conventions have been held in the various democratic countries, but the outstanding ones
were obviously the Paris convention of
December, 1946, the Montreux gathering in
November, 1948, and finally the most important, the convention held at The Hague, in
1949. It would appear therefore that all the
classes of society in France approve such a
principle and that France is ready to sacrifice at least part of the sovereignty to which
everyone knows she was so deeply attached.
If one considers the attitude taken by
France in the light of that taken by Winston
Churchill, who did not fear to state personally
at Strasbourg how the unity of democratic
nations had become a pressing necessity, and
if one takes into account the fact that this
movement is steadily gaining strength in the
United States, while spreading gradually to
the Benelux countries-Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland-one is inclined to believe
in the usefulness of a delegates' convention
such as that planned for the city of New
York.
I realize that citations sometimes prove
annoying; yet without wishing to impose on
your patience, I should like to draw your
attention to an interesting article written by
Sir Shuldham Redfern, former secretary to
the Governor General of Canada, which
appeared in the Montreal Star on May 19 of
of this year. The writer makes reference to
Canada setting an example of what a federal
state can accomplish, and he points out that
Great Britain could learn much from us in
the matter of federating. The article reads in
part as follows:
Even before a united Europe reaches the embryo
stage, the thoughts of statesmen like Mr. Pearson
are turning towards the idea of an Atlantic Union"a North Atlantic community that may one day
become a political commonwealth." That does not
mean that the united Europe stage is to be skipped.
It does mean that the unity of Western Europe
becomes a matter of very great urgency. This is
where we must look to Canada for a lesson. Let us
assume, as I think we must, that a union of the
states of western Europe would be meaningless
unless their separate governments became subordinate to a supernational authority.
In other words they must all be prepared to
sacrifice something of their national sovereignty.
That is precisely what happened in Canada when
the dissimilar if not hostile colonies, no more
homogeneous than the nations of Europe, decided to

join together in a federal union.
When the pieces of the Canadian federation were
nicely assembled and the machinery was set to

work by the impulse of a very high order of statesmanship, it was essential that there should be a
lubricant to keep the whole thing cool and frictionless. That lubricant was tolerance-and tolerance
of a far more flexible nature than can be found anywhere in Europe today.
There was one further prerequisite to the successful initiation of a federal system and that was a
political party doctrine spreading across provincial
boundaries and firmly convinced that its interests
could only be served by federation.

Honourable senators, to my mind a third

conclusion becomes inevitable.
has finally awakened to the necessity of a
federal system which would become a powerful weapon in the hands of Western nations,
while convicing the Kremlin and members
of the Politburo of the existence of a true
power unwilling to renounce any of the
privileges granted by democracy to its
followers.
I cannot bring these remarks to a close
without drawing to your attention two points

of view held by those interested in this
matter. On the one hand you have the
federalists, who claim the time has come to
establish between the states a formal and
permanent tie-such as the one I have mentioned-leading to a sort of merger, the
principles of which could be inserted in a
federal charter. This would in a way resemble the federal system established in
On the
Canada or in the United States.
other hand, we have the unionists, who
prefer to make use of certain existing bodies
-such
as Benelux, the United Nations, the
Arab League and the Pan-American League
-and to employ economic agreements. They
are convinced, or so they say, that they could
succeed in having the veto discarded. They
also feel that the states could be persuaded
to submit their differences to an international
tribunal. Finally, they believe that Russia
could be induced to establish the international form which is essential to the ratification of all resolutions adopted by the United
Nations. According to the unionists, by using
the institutions I have mentioned, the objective set by federalism could be attained
just as surely as in any other way.
The most important point to be settled by
the convention, if and when it takes place,
would be to decide whether any form of
federation is practicable today. To come
to this conclusion, the convention must take
into consideration certain matters such as
distances, cultural affinities and geographical

favourable ground for this kind of organization, could the addition of distant countries
like Canada and the United States become
an obstacle rather than an asset?

Beforo concluding 1 shall say a word about
the aim of the convention which. the motion
advocates. Would it not be desirable for
Canada, since the dolegatos would be absolutely unable to bind us-binding agreements being ef t as they are now to the
Canadian Parliament-to have a part in the
discussions?
Peace rests entirely on the degree of
security which domocracy can off or to the
world. By incroasing our proparedness, by
giving to hesitant or absorbed nations an
examplo of strength and prospority, we
shail do more in a positive fashion and
suroly obtain more practical rosuits than
could be attained through tho most appeasing
or most enthusiastic speeches.
Honourable senators, it is our duty to
spare no effort in order to bring to the

world that peace so ardently desired by ail,
and I believe this convention to bo a step
towards this goal.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before the orders of the day
are called, I wcnder whether the healer has
any information, and if not, whether he can
take steps to obtain information as to how
the government intends to proceed with the
bill to amend the Indian Act, which is now
before the other house. I should like to know
whether the bill is to be referred to a coimittee, and, if so, whether this will be a joint
committee, similar to the one that studied
Indien affairs for three years.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have no specific
knowledge about the government's intentions, on this matter, but my understanding of
parliamentary procedure is that once a bill
is introduced in either house, it is usual to
send it in due course to a committee of that
house rather than to a joint committee. I am
not aware of any intention to refer the bill
to a joint committee, and, to speak frankly,
I would not be greatly in favour of such procedure.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I was a member of the joint
committee which for three years worked on
the Indian Act, and inquiries have been made
of me as to whether arrangements will be
made to permit Indians to make representations on the present bill. From the proceedings that have taken place so far there is
every indication that Indians may be heard
by a committee of the other house, and if that

happened I was wondering whether the Senate
committee to which in due course the bill
may be referred would also hear representations from Indians.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am not in any position to say anything about that. Honourable
senators realize that, in the very nature of
things, only a relatively few members of this
house can be appointed to a joint committee.
I should think the bill would be dealt with
by the other house in the regular way and
referred to a committee, and afterwards sent
to the Senate. Then in due course it would
probably be referred to one of our standing
committees. This procedure makes it possible for a large number of senators to participate in discussion on the bill in committee.

JUNE 8, 1950
Personally, unless the house ordered otherwise, I would not be in favour of the appointment of a joint committee to consider a bill
which is before the other house.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
may I speak for a moment on another feature
of this question? I am informed that certain
promises have been made to the Indians, to
the effect that the bill introduced in the other
place would be sent to the various tribes.
According to the press, this is being done.
My Understanding is that the tribes will
require two or three weeks to consider
the measure. This is a short enough period
in which to look into it and would mean
that the bill would not be returned to parliament in sufficient time for consideration by
parliament, if it is to prorogue by the end
of June.
I would not be in favour of the bill being
referred to a joint committee. The Senate
and the House of Commons are two separate
bodies, and joint -committees deal only with
resolutions and the like. Further, this house
is a revising body, and we do not wish to
be hampered by people who wish to press
a measure through parliament.

lower than she would have had to pay elsewhere. On the other hand, our wheat producers enjoyed the best returns of any
five-year peacetime period in our history. The
contract also served as an insurance, which
enabled them to produce and market their
crop with confidence, and this has had a
great stabilizing effect on our wheat
economy.
When we negotiated our wheat contract
with Great Britain, we desired to deal with
all of our other customers on the same basis,
so long as we could guarantee supply. As
a step in this direction we attempted, in 1946,
to open discussions for an international wheat
agreement.
However, our overtures were
not accepted. In spite of this, a reference
was put in the final clause of the CanadaUnited Kingdom Agreement mentioning the
possibility of an international wheat agreement, and stating that the terms of our
contract would be brought into conformity
with such agreement.
As time went on there was a growing
feeling throughout the world that an international wheat agreement would bring
advantages to importer and exporter alike,
especially as a stabilizing influence on the
wheat trade. Conferences were arranged,

the part of many countries to deal through a
government agency; and if this desire is
indicated, sales are made through the Wheat
Board. Although this inter-governmental
trading is lessening, it appears likely that it
will continue for the next three years. For
these reasons the government is asking that
the Wheat Board he maintained as sole
marketing agency up to August 1, 1953. This
extension has been recommended by the
Canadian Federation of Agriculture.
The bill would also continue the Wheat
Board as the sole marketing agency for oats
and barley. This arrangement meets with
the whole-hearted approval of the three
western provinces, which have passed complementary legislation to permit the marketing
of these grains by the Wheat Board. This
method of marketing started with the 1949
crop year, and its extension reflects the wishes
of the great majority of producers.
The bill would also change the pool period
in respect of which payments are made to the
producers. While the Canada-United Kingdom contract was in force it was considered
desirable to provide for a pool period of flve
years. However, with the end of this contract
rapidly approaching, it is thought better to
deal separately with each crop, and to reduce
the pool period to one year.
No doubt there are other matters of great
interest and importance about which honourable senators will require more information
than I can give. It is therefore my intention,
if the bill should receive second reading, to
refer it to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. Like the Canada Grain
Bill, this measure is primarily, I suppose, a
matter for the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources; but as the Canada Grain Bill was
sent to the Committee on Banking and Commerce in order to facilitate business, and there
are certain inter-relations between that bill
and the present one which could be discussed
at the same time and probably with the same
witnesses, it seems to be the part of wisdom,
to have this bill also referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Reid: As I am not a member of
the committee mentioned by the honourable
leader, perhaps he would answer a question
I have in mind.
Hon. Mr. Roberison: I shall be happy to
do so, if I can.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Do the provisions of this
bill apply to all provinces? I ask this question
because I come from a province which, though
it raises considerable quantities of wheat and
other grains, also purchases them in large
quantities. I am wondering if the new provisions will affect all milling in the province
of British Columbia?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: That would be my
impression.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If that is the case, I think it
is very serious; and I hope I shall have the
right to appear before the committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
from New Westminster has never been denied
that privilege.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I am
pleased that the honourable leader of the
government reviewed the old Act; but I want
time to study his explanation of the bill
before I speak to it. Therefore, with leave
of the Senate, I would move the adjournment
of the debate until Monday night.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTSCONSENT OF PROVINCES
MOTION
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Marcotte:
That in the opinion of the Senate, whenever an
amendment to the Constitution of Canada is made,
or is to be made, requiring the consent of one or
more of the provinces, the said consent can only
be expressed by Act or proclamation of the legislature or legislatures of the provinces concerned.

Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
sincerely thank the honourable gentleman
from Ponteix for introducing the motion
which is now before us, and for giving us an
opportunity to express our views on the
fundamental principles of our Canadian Federation.

JUNE 8, 1950

In presenting his resolution our honourable friend explained very appro-priately the
role which the Fathers of Confederation
expected the Senate to play. I congratulate
our colleague on his most interesting remarks
and the excellent references which he cited.
As he has always done in the past, the
honourable senator gave plenty of thought
and consideration to his subject.
Even when I do not share the opinion of
our honourable friend, I deeply respect his
views, because I know how sincere a patriot
be is. On several occasions, of course, I have
considered it my duty not to vote in the same
way that he bas, but I am sure that he bas
never questioned my good faith. To be more
sipecific, I shall say that we agree, for instance,
on the necessity of obtaining the consent of
the provinces in certain cases, but in the past
we have disagreed as to whether or not certain matters were within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the provinces. Such was the
case when I supported the Family Allowances
Act; and I do not intend either to repeat or
retract the remarks which I made on the
subject on August 3, 1944, and which may be
found in Senate Hansard of that year at
pages 447 and 448.
While supporting most heartily the motion
before us, I do not at all agree with the
statement of the honourable senator from
Ponteix, to the effect that the Family Allowances Act, and the other federal enactrnents
which he mentioned yesterday, were encroachments upon the rights of the provinces. If
such were the case, the courts of. this land
could pronounce any of these acts ultra vires
and unconstitutional. At all events, I do
not consider that I am called upon by this
motion to justify my conduct in the past, and
I intend to limit myself strictly to the resolution now before us.
By way of introduction, and to show that
it is quite appropriate to discuss in this bouse
the vital question before us, it would perhaps
be sufficient to refer to the authorities cited
by our honourable friend concerning the
mission entrusted to this body by our constitution.. On this point, however, I wish
to add to just one quotation from Dawson,
The Government of Canada, page 330. It is
as follows:
The Senate was expected to take upon itself
certain particular duties which might be neglected
by the Commons. In the first place, the Senate
was to protect the interests of the provinces, for
although the small provinces were not given the
same number of senators as the two large ones, they
had nevertheless a much greater representation
proportionally than in the Lower House. Quebec,
while conceding representation by population in
the Commons, was given the explicit assurance of
such protection in the Senate.

Then I should like to quote from the remarks of George Brown, which are to be
found in the Confederation Debates of 1865,
at page 80. He said:
The very essence of our compact is that the union
shall be federal and not legislative. Our Lower
Canada friends have agreed to give us representation by population in the Lower louse, on the
express condition that they shall have equality in
the Upper House. On no other condition could we
have advanced a step.

I ask honourable senators to please note
these words by George Brown, a man whom
I would not exactly describe as a friend
of the province of Quebec.
In this instance he understood perfectly the point of
view of our people in 1867-which by the
way is still our point of view-that on no
other condition could we have advanced a
step. In other words, in our French-Canadian
way of thinking, the Senate is one of the
corner stones of our constitution. There is
no possible doubt that my native province
has always looked and is still looking to
this house as the protector of provincial
rights in general, and of the rights of Quebec
in particular. Moreover, the province, besides
possessing the rights which all of our ten
provinces have in common, is the cradle of our
French-Canadian people. Our legislature in
the ancient city founded more than three
centuries ago by Champlain has the sacred
task of perpetuating the spiritual legacy which
we received from our ancestors, and which
we are anxious to transmit unimpaired to
those who will come after us. This explains,
honourable senators, why we attach so much
importance ta the timely motion introduced by a colleague from Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte), seconded by a colleague
from the Maritimes (Hon. Mr. Veniot), and
now being spoken to by me, a senator from
Quebec. I feel sure that senators from other
provinces will concur in the remarks which
were made on the main object of his motion
by the honourable gentleman from Ponteix.
The point now under discussion is: How
should, any province give its consent, if it
be required, to an amendment to the Con-

stitution of Canada?
In November last I
spoke at some length on the resolution for
transferring to Canada power to amend the
British North America Act in purely federal
matters. My remarks may be found in the
Senate Hansard, at pages 209 to 215 of the
French edition, and pages 200 to 205 of the
English edition.
In certain quarters I have been criticized
for my attitude on that occasion. But, honourable senators, as a lawyer who has devoted
forty years of his life to researches in the
field of law, I must say that there are certain
theories, old though they ýmay be, which
I consider to be legally unfounded and which

SENATE
in my conscience I cannot accept. Even
if a certain traditional interpretation has
obtained popular acceptance, I am quite willing to face any criticism rather than to
subscribe to it if I firmly believe it to be
inaccurate.
Hon. Mr. David: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: After two score years of
study, if I find a so-called constitutional
"dogma" to be contradicted by the most
authoritative definitions and the most clearly
established principles of constitutional and
international law, I owe too much respect
to truth to sacrifice my convictions to anyone, however intimate may have been our
relations in the years gone by. This was
my attitude previously, honourable senators,
and it is still my attitude today.
Over the radio and in the press some of my
statements have been misquoted and misrepesented in the past. However, I intend
again to discuss the constitutional issue now
before us as being essentially a question of
law and of political science. An important
constitutional problem of this kind is above
all personalities. If some of my opponents
outside this house want to take a different
approach and to introduce purely moral and
historical considerations, or even to enter
into a politico-religious controversy, I will
not follow them into such a "no man's land."
Having made my position clear in this way,
I shall now try to envisage as objectively as
possible the great problem at present under
discussion.
On the lst of November, 1949, though I did
not accept in toto the "compact" theory, I
recognized quite frankly, as I said, that "the
Quebec Resolutions were used as the main
basis for our federation," and that to a certain degree those resolutions have a contractual character. My remarks on that point
may be found in the Senate Hansard for the
first session of 1949, page 203. I explained
at that time, and I wish to affirrn today even
more emphatically, that our constitution is
the result of negotiations between the representatives of the four original provinces. In
fact, the Fathers of Confederation agreed on
three fundamental principles: (1), the federal
nature of the union: (2), respect for provincial
self-government: (3), preservation of the
distinct and separate institutions of Lower
Canada. On the fact that there was such a
triple agreement, I concur in the views
expressed by Father Richard Arès, at page
10 of his book, which was referred to yesterday by the honourable senator from Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte), La Confédération:
Pacte ou Loi?
From this agreement, which was confirmed
in 1867, it follows that it would be purely

and simply a breach of faith to try to change
unilaterally the federal character of our constitution, or to encroach upon provincial jurisdiction or undermine Quebec's own institutions.
On this question of principle there has
never been any doubt in my mind. I wish
to assure this house and the people of my
province that I am just as desirous as are any
of my critics to have our constitution maintained. For the reasons which I gave on the
1st of November last I was sincerely of opinion that the consent of the provinces was not
necessary for the amendment being considered at that time. But as I then stated
clearly, as will be found by reference to page
202 of our Hansard, nobody contestis the
necessity of obtaining the consent of the
provinces whenever, for instance, there is any
proposal to modify the jurisdiction of the
provinces on the matters enumerated in section 92 of the British North America Act. In
other words, our provinces possess some
definite vested rights-what we call in French
droits acquis-which cannot be changed
without their unanimous consent. Today
I shall try to study the precise nature of provincial rights for if we ascertain their nature
we shall be able to determine how a province
should consent to the modification of any of
its rights.
Honourable senators, provincial rights consist in all those powers of sovereignty which
are vested in our provinces under the terms
of the British North America Act, as interpreted b-y the Privy Council. The Privy
Council has always taken the view "that the
federation Act exhausts the whole range of
legislative power", and that whatever is not
given by that Act to the provincial legislatures rests with the Canadian parliament.
That is the decision in the case of Bank of
Toronto v Lambe, (1887) 12 Appeal Cases,
page 587.
The principle of the sovereignty or, if you
wish, autonomy of the provinces, has been
affirmed and developed by the Privy Council
as a consequence of its rule of interpretation
to the effect that we must consider as exhaustive the distribution of powers assigned by the
B.N.A. Act to the federal and provincial
authorities respectively.
The principle of the sovereignty of our
Canadian provinces was formally expounded
in the case of Hodge v. The Queen, (1883) 9
Appeal Cases, page 117. I wish to quote an
extract taken from O'Connor's Report to the
Senate (1939), Annex 3, page 22, as follows:
When the British North America Act enacted that
there should be a legislature for Ontario and that

JUNE 8. 1950
its legislative assembly should have exclusive authority to make laws for the province and for provincial purposes in relation to the matters enumerated in section 92, it conferred powers not in any
sense to be exercised by delegation from or as
agents of, the Imperial Parliament, but authority
as plenary and as ample, within the limits prescribed by section 92 as the Imperial Parliament, in
the plenitude of its power, possessed and could
bestow. Within these limits of subjects and area
the local legislature is supreme-

at the time of the signing of the Treaty at
Versailles.
Moreover,
until
1931
the
sovereignty of our Canadian Parliament was
limited by the Colonial Laws Validity Act.
On this last point I wish to refer the house
to the case of Nadan v. The King, (1926)
Appeal Cases, page 482.
In fact, after 1867 and until the enactment
of the Statute of Westminster in 1931,

SENATE
Thus, because the federal and provincial
authorities are co-ordinate, the Privy Council
held that:
A Lieutenant Governor is as much the representative of His Majesty for all purposes of provincial
government as the Governor General himself is for
all purposes of dominion government.

This view was implied in the decision
rendered in Attorney-General of Canada
v. Attorney-General (1898) A.C. 247 at 253;
the rule was fully developed in the Bonanza
Creek Case, (1916) 1 A.C. 566. Once more,
in the Companies Reference Case, (1912)
A.C. 584, as well as in B.C. v. Canada, (1914)
A.C. 153, the Privy Council held that:
Whatever belongs te self-government in Canada
belongs either te the dominion or to the provinces

within the limits of the B.N.A. Act.

The autonomy of the provinces was again
affirmed in the reference re the Manitoba
Initiative and Referendum Act, (1919) A.C.
935. After referring to the powers of the
Lieutenant Governors (O'Connors' Report,
Annex 3, 87), Lord Haldane adds:
The scheme of the Act passed in 1867 was thus,
net te weld the provinces into one, nor te subordinate provincial governments to a central authority, but te establish a central government in which
these provinces should be represented, entrusted
with exclusive authority only in affairs in which
they had a common interest. Subject te this each
province was te retain its independence and autonomy and te be directly under the Crown as its
head. Within these limits of area and subjects, its
local legislature, se long as the Imperial Parliament
did net repeal its own Act conferring this status,
was te be supreme, and had such powers as the
Imperial Parliament possessed in the plenitude of
its own freedom before it handed them over te the
dominion and the provinces in accordance with the
scheme of distribution which it enacted in 1867.

Then, in the case of Great West Saddlery
v. The King, (1921) 2 A.C. 91, at 100, Lord
Haldane affirmed thatWithin the spheres allotted te them by the
(B.N.A.) Act the dominion and the provinces are
rendered in general principle co-ordinate governments.

Insurers Case, (1924) A.C. 328, (O'Connors'

Hon. Mr. Euler: Would my honourable

just said, the power of the federal governof provincial

governments?
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I am quite willing to make
a passing remark on that subject, but I should
point out that the general plan of my address
today is merely to describe the nature of the
rights of the provinces as defined by the Privy
Council. It is always 'possible for those of us
who are lawyers to come to the conclusion in
this or that case that we might have rendered
a different judgment; but I would say that

precedents which have been set forth by the
highest tribunal of the Empire are surely
binding upon us. Although it may be contended that the right of appointment of lieutenant governors by the Governor General in
Council shows that the greater power belongs
to the federal government, I believe that the
position of the two authorities is substantially
the same, in face of the following situation.
In 1867, sovereignty was, so to speak, divided
in two halves. One half-with the addition of
the two special privileges which I have just
mentioned-was attributed to the dominion
government. The other half provincial legislation-if we move along the avenue of time
and come to the present year-is now in the
hands of our ten sister provinces. I would
say that in a certain sense the sum-total of the
powers of the federal authority and of the
powers of our ten legislatures are practically
equal. In the international field it may be
said that, in principle, external sovereignty
is possessed only by the federal state;
although, as we shall see later on, in the
Labour Conventions case it was held that the
treaty powers of the federal authorities do not
extend to provincial matters.
The question of disallowance was, in my
opinion, a stumbling-block to confederation.
Dozens of cases arose immediately after 1867,
when there was always some so-called just
cause

for

interfering

with

provincial

autonomy. I think it can be said, to the glory
of the party to which I belong, that we were
the champions of provincial autonomy, and
that in times gone by our predecessors in the
Liberal ranks protested with all their energy
against the encroachment of the federal
authorities. But the hands of the clock do
not stand still. Nowadays only in the most
extraordinary circumstances, when some provincial Act is, so to speak, repugnant to the
conscience of any good Canadian, would the
Governor in Council interfere. It is through
co-operation between the federal authorities
and the local authorities, not by a brutal and
unwise exercise of disallowance powers, that
the future of our country can be assured.
I wish now to mention the subject of fiscal
autonomy. Provincial sovereignty would be
pure illusion unless our provinces were provided with sources of revenue adequate to
enable them to exercise their sovereign powers
within their own sphere. On this point I wish
to quote the following remarks of Lord Phillimore in the case of Caron v. The King, (1924)
A.C. 999:
As such particular direct taxation is reserved te
the province, te that extent there is some deduction
te be made from the totality of powers apparently
given exclusively te the Dominion Parliament te
raise money for any purpose by any mode or
system of taxation.

JUNE 8, 1950
As the result, on the one hand, of our
superhuman contribution to two world wars,
and, on the other hand, of national sehemes
of social security, our federal taxes now
absorb a very large part-72 per cent, I
understand-of the total amount which can
be collected "by .any mode or system of taxation". It follows fromn this that our provinces
are seriously handicapped in the field of
social legisiation. An*y national scheme may
offer -advantages from. a financial point of
view, but we are most anxious to preserve
for the institutions of Quebec their distinct
and proper character. In particular I may

entail a partial surrender 0f sorne provincial
powers for *a certain period of trne, but as I
stated at the National Liberal C.nvention
in 1948, I arn against a final surrender of
provincial fiscal autonomy.
Moreover,' I
remain convinced that the provinces should
be assured of some clearly defined field of
taxation. I mean a field of taxation which,
prqperly speaking, would be exclusively provincial.
It must always be rernembered that federalisma is essentially a compromise. Personally,
I have accepted several ýamendments to our
constitution which may be considered as
having enlarged the federal jurisdiction. The
day has now corne when I believe that any
further concession on behalf of the provinces
should be consented to only upon the basis
of an exchange of powers, and that some ýcompensatory advantage should be granted by the
federal authorities se, as to maintain effectively a certain degree of decentralization. I
arn in favour of a strong central power, but
I believe that strong provincial powers are
equally indispensable for the survival and
healthy development of our Canadian Federation.
On this point I wish to quote an extract
from. the decision rendered in the Persons
Case, (1930) Appeal Cases, 124:

fair play which was evident on ahl sides, at
the last federal-provincial conference in January last, we have every reason to trust God
and our country. But we mnust always remember that federalism was the cradle of eur
Canadian nation, and that our survival as a
nation is dýependent in a large measure upon
the fiscal autýonorny of our provinces. No

once more to fiscal autonomy. In the case of
In

SENATE

Forbes v. Attorney General for Manitoba,
(1937) A.C., 260, it was held that dominion
and provincial income tax legislation "may
co-exist", and that dominion civil servants
may be subject to provincial income tax. In
the case of The Judges v. Attorney General
of Saskatchewan, (1937), 53 T.L.R., page 464,
the same rule was applied to "judicial emolument".
My summary of previous cases decided by
the Privy Council requires me to refer also
to the Labour Conventions case, (1937), A.C.,
page 326. In that case it was held:
That jurisdiction to legislate for the purpose of
performing the obligations of a Canadian treaty
does not reside exclusively in the parliament of
Canada.
No decision illustrates more clearly the extent
of the sovereignty vestel in the provinces,
because it affects even the external sovereignty of Canada. As a result of the Statute
of Westminster, it was affirmed in the Labour
Conventions case:
That no further legislative competence was obtained by the dominion from its accession to international status and the consequent increase in the
scope of its executive functions. There was no
existing constitutional ground for stretching the
competence of the dominion parliament so that it
became enlarged to keep pace with enlarged functions of the dominion executive.
It also was held:
That in totality of legislative powers, dominion
and provincial together, Canada was fully equipped
to legislate in performance of treaty obligations, but
the legislative powers remained distributed, and if
in the exercise of her new functions, derived from
her new international status, Canada incurred obligations, they must, so far as legislation was concerned, when they dealt with provincial classes of
subjects, be dealt with by the totality of powersby co-operation between the dominion and the
provinces.
In

international matters, as remarked in that

case by Lord Atkin:

That our provincial legislatures possess
powers which form part of sovereignty is
made perfectly clear by the decision of the
Privy Council in the Labour Conventions case.
Even in international matters, it has been
held that our provinces are vested in a

certain sense with sovereignty in subjectmatters outside the jurisdiction of the federal
parliament.
The jurisprudence of the Privy Council
which I have summarized-and I apologize
for having taken so much time-proves beyond any doubt that provincial rights have
in their nature some attributes of sovereignty.

provisions applicable to my province, namely,

those in section 65. Section 65 deflnes the
powers to be exercised by the Lieutenant
Governor of Ontario and Quebec, respectively,
individually or with the advice of the respective executive councils, etc. Section 65 provides, in substance, that:
All powers, authorities, and functions which under
any Act . . . were or are before or at the Union
vested in or exercisable by the respective governors
or lieutenant governors of those provinces . . .
shall, as far as the same are capable of being exercised after the Union in relation to the government

to such as exist under Acts of Parliament of Great
Britain, or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland), to be abolished or
altered by the respective legislatures of Ontario and

Quebec.
I have quoted section 65 almost in full,
because I believe that its provisions will
furnish us with an answer to the question
raised by the motion of the senator from
Ponteix.
As honourable senators know, it was not
necessary to have similar provisions for Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, because the constitutions of those two Maritime Provinces
were to continue as they had existed before
confederation. In so far as Quebec is concerned, the powers of our provincial government are, under section 65 those which existed
in 1867, unless they have been altered by the
Quebec Legislature.
Could it be contended, honourable senators,
that in 1867 the representative of the Crown
in Upper and Lower Canada, acting either
individually or with the advice of the executive council of the then province of Canada,
had the power to consent to an ameidment of

JUNE 8, 1950

the constitution? Before 1867, under the Constitutional Act of 1840, responsible government
had already been recognized in Canada. Any
amendment to the constitution was therefore
a matter not to be decided by the governor
acting individually.
At the time of the passage of the British
North America Act other fundamental principles of the British constitution were also
already firmly established in this country.
It was then accepted doctrine not only that
ministers are responsible to parliament, but
that the British constitution rests on a balance
of powers and maintains "a division between
the executive, the legislative and the judicial
bodies." (Dicey -Law of the Constitution,
9th edition, page 156). In particular, the
distinction between legislation and administration had been, at the time of our federal
union, well established for a couple of centuries. We would look in vain for any
parliamentary delegation of power, granted
before or after 1867, enabling provincial
governments to consent by order in council
to any amendment of the constitution. As
remarked by Dawson, at page 198 of Government of Canada, "the cabinet as a body is
almost completely ignored by the statutes";
and the powers of the cabinet are exercised
"in accordance with the custom of the
constitution."
The fact is that there cannot be found
any custom or legislative Act dating from
before or after 1867 which confers a general
authority upon a provincial government to
consent to amendments to the constitution.
On the contrary, when, for instance, in 1947
the Quebec legislature enacted legislation to
authorize certain inter-governmental agreements, it limited the authority given to the
provincial executive in the following ways.
(1) In the Act respecting Provincial-Federal
Relations, (1947), Chapter 4, Section 3 provides that:
Any agreement shall, before becoming final, be
submitted to the approval of the legislature.

(2) The agreements with governments contemplated by sections 35 of the Corporation
Tax Act (1947) Chapter 33, refer simply to
methods of collection of taxes.
The authorization thus granted in 1947 show
very clearly that the Quebec Government considered itself as being entrusted with the
administration of our provincial affairs, with
the application of our various statutes. It
recognized, quite rightly, that it was an executive organism, not a legislative body, and that
its functions were in general limited to acts
of administration. But, constitutional amendments affect provincial sovereignty; in particular, any surrender of jurisdiction existing
under section 92 of the British North America
55950-30

Act is very clearly an act of alienation.
Because such a surrender is an act of alienation, it exceeds ahsolutely the powers of
administration of any provincial government.
From this it follows, in my opinion, that the
consent to constitutional amendments must
be given by the legislature. It is necessary to
obtain the formal consent of the legislature
itself-namely the direct consent of the representatives of the people of the provinces concerned. Provided such consent is given by the
legislature, I would consider as optional the
form chosen, whether by resolution or by Act.
By way of conclusion, let me refer to the
practice followed in such matters in our
Canadian Parliament. The text of a resolution introduced in the House of Commons
by Mr. Holton, seconded by the Honourable
Alexander
Mackenzie, and unanimously
adopted on March 27, 1871, is as follows:
That the executive

government ought not to ask

for amendments to the British North America Act,
without the assent previously obtained of the Parliament of this Dominion.
The circumstances under which that resolution originated are very well described in
the excellent book of Dr. M. Ollivier entitled

Problems of Canadian Sovereignty, at pages
363-365. There the author refers to the period
when steps were being taken for the admission of the Northwest Territory into our federation, and for the organization of the
Province of Manitoba. I quote now from Dr.
Ollivier, page 364, as follows:
In 1871 the Canadian Government petitioned the
Imperial Government to present to the Parliament
of the United Kingdom a law to dissipate any doubts
which had arisen as to the powers of the Canadian
Parliament to establish provinces in the territory
added or to be added to the Dominion of Canada.
In its turn the Imperial Government transmitted
to the Canadian Government the bill which it
intended to pass. The Honourable Mr. Blake protested that the constitution should not be amended
on the simple request of a minister of the Crown
or even of the government. He declared that the
Imperial Government ought not to amend the
British North America Act except when it had so
been requested by the Canadian people as expressed
by the voice of their representatives.

I would refer to Volume II of the Parliamentary Debates of 1871, page 65. Like Blake,
Sir Alexander Galt was of the opinion:
...

that it was to the House and the Senate that

the right appertained to decide what legislation
they wished the Imperial Parliament to pass for
Canada.

Galt also stated.
...
that it was opportune to decide once and for
ail that no amendment ought to be made to the
constitution except by the accepted and recognized

method of an address of the two federal houses.

On April 12 and 13 respectively, in the year
1871, the House of Commons and the Senate
adopted an -address to Her Majesty, praying

that the bill approved by the Parliament of

SENATE

the United Kingdom-namely the British
North America Act 1871-Manitoba-should
be submitted to parliamént.
In 1875, however, the Imperial Parliament,
at the request of the Governor in Council,
passed an Act to settle doubts as to the power
of the Canadian Parliament to define its own
privileges. A resolution demanding parliamentary rather than executive action was
introduced, but was withdrawn.
Let us note here the remarks of Dr. Ollivier,
at page 366:
For the first and last time a statute amending
our constitution was passed by the Parliament of
the United Kingdom simply on the demand of the
Canadian Government.
This means that we have in our Canadian
Parliament a custom and a practice, followed
without interruption for three-quarters of a
century, which requires the federal government to obtain the consent of parliament for
any amendment to our constitution. This is a
wise practice, sanctified by long usage, and is
in accordance with the fundamental principles
of our constitution. I submit that this tradition should also be accepted by our provinces
whenever their consent is required for any
constitutional amendment. Any different procedure, in my opinion, would be unconstitutional.
In particular, let us never forget that the
distribution of powers is an essential feature
of federalism. RYtis for us a safeguard for
minority rights. Such a distribution of power
is also a most effective protection against
communism or totalitarianism, in any form
or shape.
On this point, and by way of conclusion,
I wish to quote some remarks of E. C. S.
Wade, the greaýt constitutional jurist. In his
preface to Dicey's Law of the Constitution,
9th edition, p. i xi, after making special reference to our federal constitution, Wade affirms:
Unless member states are willing to abandon their
sphere of legislative competence, no federal state in
the enjoyment of a parliamentary form of government can by constitutional means achieve that con-

centration of power which is essential to the totali-

guarantees given to minorities in 1867 should
always be respected as a sacred pledge.
Thank you.

May I also at this time refer briefly to a
question asked by the honourable senator
from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn) when
we were discussing the motion for second
reading of the bill?
Honourable senators
will recall that my honourable friend deplored the fact that the bill made no provision for a coastguard service-a subject in
which he has been interested for some time.
I admitted that the bill contained no reference to it, but I took exception to his

suggestion that, when ships of our own or
any other nationality are disabled or come
to grief on our coasts, we are in the humiliating position of having to call for aid upon
United States services. I then said, speaking
purely from memory, that although Canada
has no regular

coastguard

it

does possess

a closely integrated system of relief for ships
that are in need of assistance.

I have now an exact record of what has
happened in this respect for a period of
somewhat over a year. A summary of search
and rescue from October 1, 1948 to May 31,
1950, indicates that in that period United
States assistance to Canadian shipping was
given in twenty-one cases, and that Canadian

CANADA SHIPPING BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. A. L. Beaubien presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications on Bill Y-8.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant,
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to whom was referred Bill Y-8, an Act
to amend the Canada Shipping Act, 1934, have in
obedience to the order of reference of June 6, 1950,
examined the'said bill, and now beg leave to report
the same with the following amendment:
Page 2, line 39: Delete "Safety" and substitute
"appropriate."

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the amendment be
taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien; With leave, I move
that the amendment be concurred in now.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, I move that the bill be read the third
time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
TRUST COMPANIES BILL

He said: Honourable senators, the Department of Transport consists of three major
operating services-canals, marine and air.
The administration of these services requires
that considerable quantities of equipment and
material be kept on hand. For this reason the
Department of Transport Stores Act was
passed, to provide the necessary finances to
maintain and replenish such supplies.
The Act which was passed in 1937 made
provision for the setting up of a capital fund
of $1,957,368. The inventory then on hand
amounted to $957,368. This was a first charge
against the fund, and left $1,000,000 which
could be used to maintain the stores.
Since that time two major changes have
taken place which make it desirable to
increase the working capital. First, with the
union of Newfoundland and Canada, and the
consequent taking over of stores in Newfoundland, to a value of $1,200,000, the total inventory on hand increased, as of March 31, 1950,
to approximately $3,000,000. It would seem
quite obvious, therefore, that a larger working capital is required to maintain these stores.
Second, since 1937 there has been a general
price increase of about 110 per cent. This
means that even if the volume of stores on
hand had not increased-which it has-more
money would now be necessary to maintain
those stores than was required in 1937.
Section 1 of the bill provides for advances
to the minister for the purpose of increasing
the working capital from $1,957,368 to
$4,000,000. The stores now on hand-about
$3,000,000 worth-will be a first charge against
this sum. This will leave an amount of
approximately $1,000,000 which will be available for the maintenance of these stores.
Section 6 of the Act, which is repealed by
section 2 of the bill, reads as follows:
The inventory of stores at the end of each fiscal
year shall not exceed one million six hundred
thousand dollars.

It is not considered feasible to operate
under the inventory ceiling provided by this
section. Practice has indicated that the limitation on advances provided for by section 1
of the bill is the most effective method of

SENATE
As to the new section 8, I may explain that
there is at present no provision in the Act for
the adjustment of inventories of stores that
are reduced through obsolescence, unserviceability, loss, or destruction. It is considered
impossible to operate a stores organization of
this magnitude without encountering some
reductions of this character, which, however,
are normally relatively small.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Will my honourable friend
tell us the nature of the stores that will be
covered by this proposed vote?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If my honourable friend
insists on getting that information, it would
be well to refer the bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is quite all right.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

divide the proceeds, was continued as an
inducement to men to enter the naval service.
So the institution of prize money goes back
many years. The Court of Admiralty, which
for centuries has had control of the distribution of prize money, records as early as 1357
that certain goods, the property of citizens
of Portugal, were brought into a British port
and condemned as good and valid prize
money. At that time there was no organized
navy. When the Royal Navy was first organized, the practice of distributing prize money
was continued as an inducement to men to
join the service, and it has continued in force
in Great Britain and the Commonwealth until
very recent times.
In 1948, however, Great Britain, through
the passage of an act to distribute prize
money, announced that former methods of
distribution would be continued no longer.

these two ships were sold for $58,155.27, and
this sum, along with the proceeds of the War
Risk Insurance on the two vessels, amounting
to $501,487.97, was placed in the Consolidated
Revenue Fund of Canada. This made a total
of $559,643.24, or slightly over a half million
dollars. The balance of Canada's contribution of $808,000, is in the hands of the British
Treasury as part of the prize money fund,
and the distribution is a matter of bookkeeping.
There has been an agreement between the
nations of the commonwealth as to the share
to be received by each. For her contribution,
Canada receives $2ý million, of which
$800,000 goes to the air force and $1,700,000,
to the navy. That is to say, our air force,
because of the large part it played in the
capture of the prize vessels, will receive 32
per cent, instead of 25 per cent, and consequently our navy's share will be 68 per cent.
The problem of how to divide prize money
among those entitled to it in varying degrees
is a very difficult one. In the old days the
entire crew of the capturing ship participated
in the distribution. The share that went to
each member of the crew depended upon his
rank-the captain got more than the mate,
the mate more than the bosun, and so on down
the line. But it is no longer possible to follow this simple method, and it has been considered unwise to distribute the money in
equal shares to the entire personnel of the
capturing forces, for in that case the amount
payable to each man would be comparatively
small. A better plan, it has been thoughtand I certainly agree-is to put the prize
money into the benevolent funds of the services concerned; and that is what will be done
under this bill.
Sections 2 and 3 of the bill permit the payment of prize money out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund.
Section 2 needs a little further explanation.
As I have already said, during the war two
vessels were taken in prize by Canada.
Before prize proceedings were begun the
vessels were put into Canadian service and
sunk. Proceeds of the war risk insurance
were paid into the Consolidated Revenue
Fund, and at the same time the amount of
this insurance was credited to the Commonwealth Prize Pool. Canada actually kept the
money, and must now apply it against the
payments due her frorn the pool.
In addition to the money mentioned in
section 2, certain payments will be forthcoming from the pool. Section 3 permits these
moneys to be received into the Consolidated
Revenue Fund and paid out of it.
Section 4 is to provide that, as I stated a
moment ago, 68 per cent of the moneys

received by Canada shall go to the Naval
Service Benevolent Trust Fund and 32 per
cent to the Air Force Benevolent Fund.
I do not think any further explanation is
necessary. The amounts that will be distributed to the two benevolent funds are set out
in explanatory notes to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can the honourable gentleman tell us what is the total amount resting
in the pool under, I suppose, the control of
Britain, the dominant participant in the pool?
And can he inform us whether the value of
the ships taken over and given to Britain will
be reckoned in the pool? We are still
officially at war with Germany, and it is my
submission that the money for these ships
that have been given to Britain should be
included in the pool.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable gentleman bas me at a disadvantage. I am afraid
that I cannot answer him. The figures as to
the general pool are obtainable from British
rather than Canadian sources, although of
course they are available to us. Neither can
I answer the question as to what is included
in the pool or may for the moment be
excluded from it. I presume that ships of
Germany, with whom we are still at war, are
included. I see no reason why they would not
be, for we have not signed a peace treaty
with Germany. I can assure my honourable
friend that it was on a war basis, not a peace
basis, that those German ships were regarded
as prizes; and although I have no personal
knowledge on the matter, I take it that the
proceeds are in the pool. If the honourable
gentleman thinks it is important to have the
information, I have no doubt that the leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) will move that the bill
be sent to committee, where departmental
officials may be questioned.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think it is important to
have this information.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Canada's share of the
pool is about $2,500,000, but I am unable to
say what is the total amount in the pool.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The handling of the prize
money from the German ships is a purely
business transaction, and I am out to see that
Canada gets ber full share.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I wish to inform the Senate that the work
of the Standing Committee on Divorce has

usual at this time to submit certain divorce
statistics in the nature of a report.
The Standing Committee on Divorce beg
leave to make their 249th Report as follows:
For the present session 301 petitions for Bills of

Divorce were presented to the Senate and dealt with
by the Committee on Divorce as follows:

Under existing divorce rules a period of 60 days
must elapse following the service of the petition
before the petitioner can be heard. The 56 petitions

which have not been dealt with are in this category,

the 60 days period not having elapsed and the
petitions therefore not being ready for a hearing.
They will likely be proceeded with at the next

session of parliament.

Of the petitions recommended during the present

session of parliament 64 were by husbands and 176

were by wives.
Of the 240 petitions recommended 235 were from
petitioners domiciled in the province of Quebec, and

5 were from petitioners domiciled in the province of

Newfoundland.

The committee held 38 meetings.

On 16 days the

committee functioned in two sections.
In 32 cases the committee recommended that part

of the parliamentary fees be rernitted.

Your committee regrets that parliament has not
yet seen fit to solve the problem of parliamentary
divorce by setting up suitable tribunals before
which the numerous cases from Quebec and Newfoundland can be heard. It is to be hoped that
something will be done in that regard in the near
future, because under the present set-up members
of the Divorce Committee are compelled to spend
the greater part of their time in hearing evidence,
and thus have little or no time left for the performance of their other important duties.

Honourable senators, that is the committee's report. It is usual to file it and print
it in our records, without a motion for its
adoption.
I should like to take advantage of this
opportunity to make a few general remarks.
I regret that my duties as Deputy Leader
of the Opposition make it impossible for me
to continue any longer as a member of the
Divorce Committee. My associations with
the members of the committee over the past
sixteen years have been very happy indeed.
The members have been most faithful in
their attendance, day after day, for five and
sometimes six days a week, and I have always
had their loyal support. By way of example
I might mention that the honourable gentleman from Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding) missed
only one meeting of the committee this session.
The contribution of senators of the legal
profession who were added to the committee
this session has also been valuable and is
much appreciated.
Even the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) functioned for two days, and the
honourable gentlemen from Carleton (Hon.
Mr. Fogo), and Vancouver-South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) each served for a number of days.
I also wish to take this opportunity to
thank the Commjttee Clerks for their faithful
attention to details and their most efficient
handling of the many preliminaries. It is my
opinion that more capable men could not be
found for the duties that they have performed.

SENATE
Our duties have been onerous and disagreeable, but we have carried them out to
the best of our ability.
I am giving notice to the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) now, so
that fie will have time before the next
session of parliament to make what arrangements he deems necessary in consequence of
my retirement.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: May I ask the honourable gentleman where he secured his statistics
as to the number of divorce cases in the
various provinces? It would not be necessary
for me to ask that question if I were a
lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: From the Bureau of
Statistics.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: The federal bureau?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes, in Ottawa.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, as stated by the honourable the
Chairman of the Committee on Divorce (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), it is customary simply to print
the committee's annual presentation of
statistics without a motion for adoption of
the report, but I should not like this occasion
to go by without my expressing a word of
appreciation to the honourable gentleman
and those associated with him on the
committee for the faithful discharge of their
arduous duties. While I greatly regret my
honourable friend's decision not to serve on
the committee in future, I cannot say that
this comes to me as news, since he indicated
to me at the beginning of the present session
that fie wished to resign from the committee,
and it was only at my earnest solicitation that
he kindly consented to remain. As the
responsibility for finding personnel to serve
on this committee is largely mine, I am
grateful to him for his services.
Whether or not some other procedure will
be adopted for the handling of the divorce
cases which now corne before parliament,
remains to be seen; but at present this work
is the responsibility of the Senate, and I think
that honourable senators, when they are
asked to do so, should help in some way with
the discharge of this duty. The responsibility
is the responsibility of this chamber as a
whole; and I say emphatically that there is
no reason why some senators should carry
the whole load while others escape entirely.
I expect that at the beginning of the next
session we will again be faced with the problem of finding suitable personnel for the
Divorce Committee, and I hope that honourable senators will bear in mind what I have
had to say about the sharing of the work.
Again I wish to extend to the chairman
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the members of the

committee my own appreciation, and that of
the house, of the faithful manner in which
they have discharged their onerous duties.
They have set a fine example for others to
follow. I regret very much that, with the
retirement of the present chairman, the committee will lose the benefit of his long experience and excellent judgment; but he has acted
in this capacity for many years, and I am
sure that every member of the Senate
appreciates what he has done and commends
him for his regular and untiring service
Hon. W. H. Golding: Honourable senators,
I cannot let this opportunity pass without
paying my tribute to the retiring chairman
of the Divorce Committee. As a member of
that committee, I have always had complete
confidence in his judgment in the cases which
came before us, for he is thoroughly conversant with the rules of evidence and the
law pertaining to divorce. Although the work
of the committee, by its very nature, is far
from pleasant, I may say that it was
always a pleasure to work with him. This
house owes the honourable senator a debt of
gratitude for his many years of service, and I
for one sincerely regret that he has decided
to discontinue the office of chairman. I have
done everything in my power to persuade
him to continue. Perhaps, before the commencement of another session, he may reconsider the decision fie has made at this time.
My honourable friend well deserves a
tribute from this house, and I take pleasure
in expressing my sentiments on this occasion.
Sone Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
LOAN COMPANIES BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson presented Bill J-10, an
Act to amend the Loan Companies Act.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I would move that
this bill, J-10, be placed on the order paper
for second reading today, following the order
for the second reading of Bill F-10, an Act to
amend the Trust Companies Act.
I may explain that these two bills are very
closely related, and when the first of them is
called I shall ask the honourable senator
from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) to explain,
and his explanation will be applicable to both.
So then, if the house sees fit to give these
two bills second reading this afternoon,
tomorrow they can be considered together in
committee, where all interested parties will
have an opportunity to be heard.
The motion was agreed to.

JUNE 12, 1950

that these bills be not delayed in reaching the
other house. For that reason I would ask
that they be giver second and third readings
this afternoon.
With leave, I move second reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the second time, on division.

division.
INCOME TAX BILL
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the orders of the day are proceeded
with, may I answer the inquiry made by the
honourable leader opposite about the printing
of amendments to the Income Tax Bill?
I discussed this question with the Minister
of Finance, who said that he would take the
matter under consideration.
I am now
advised by the Law Clerk of the Senate that
the printing of amendments to legislation is,
as a rule, handled by the house in which the
legislation originates-in this case the House
of Commons. There is a further complication
by reason of the large volume of work in the
Printing Bureau at the present time; nevertheless; the inquiry of my honourable friend
has been placed before the Minister, and in
due course I will probably be advised in the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.

TRUST COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo moved the second
reading of Bill F-10, an Act to amend the
Trust Companies Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Trust
Companies Act, chapter 29 of the Revised
Statutes, provides for the incorporation of
dominion trust companies, and for their
regulation. It may interest you to know that
today there are in Canada twelve such companies. On the other hand, there are many
trust companies incorporated and regulated
by provincial legislation of much the same
character as this statute.
The present Act was fairly extensively
revised in 1947, and the bill before you,
which is not a long one, deals with three
features in respect of which amendments
now appear to be desirable. It is intended
to bring some of the investment provisions
more nearly into line wth those covered by
recent legislation relating to Canadian insurance companies, to confer certain new powers
of investment and of lending of money, and
to clarify and correct some existing provisions.
The existing Act makes a distinction
between two classes of funds held by trust
companies: those which are the property of
their clients or patrons, and those which
belong to the company itself, its capital.
The power to invest the trust funds of a
company, whether in guaranteed or unguaranteed funds, is covered by section 63 of the
Act, and the provisions relating to the investment of a company's own funds appear in
section 67.
As regards trust funds held by companies, there is a slight change having to do
with investment in mortgages or hypothecs on
freehold real estate. It provides not that a
mortgage loan by the company be limited to
60 per cent of the value of the real estate,
but that the mortgage taken by the trust company, together with any mortgage which has
preceded it, shall not exceed 60 per cent.
In other words, the new provision would
permit a trust company to hold a second
mortgage on real estate, provided that the
sum of the mortgage loans on the property
is not in excess of 60 per cent of the value of
the real estate.
The second change relates to a class of
investment to which reference was made a
week ago in another debate, and which is
known as income realty. The limitations are
set out in section 10 of the bill. It will be
recalled that provision was made in the' recent
insurance bill for investment in freehold real
estate for the production of income where the

SENATE

property was leased to or guaranteed by a corporation having a dividend record that
complied with the provisions of the Act,
namely that in each of the five years preceding the date of the investment it had paid a
dividend at least equal to the annual rate on
all its preferred shares, or a dividend in each
of the five years upon its common shares of at
least 4 per cent of the average value at which
such shares were carried in the books; and
further, that the lease would provide sufficient
revenue to repay at least 85 per cent of the
principal in a period not exceeding thirty
years.
A good many of us, when we think of
income real estate, have in mind chain-store
buildings, because that is the type of security
which is usually contemplated in this type
of financing. Certain limitations are imposed
on the extent to which such securities may
be purchased or invested in. The amount is
restricted to 5 per cent of the funds held by
the investing company, or 25 per cent of its
unimpaired paid-up capital and reserve; and
the amount invested in any particular piece of
real estate is not to exceed one-half of one
per cent of the aggregate of the company's
own funds and of the trust moneys held by
it. So, it will be observed, there is a limitation in two respects.
There is another rather important change.
As the Act stood, companies were permitted to
set up what was known as a general trust
fund, or a common trust fund, but with the
limitation that only $3,000 from any one trust
could be put in that fund for investment. In
practice it has been found that at least one
separate general fund for each province is
essential, and that the limit of $3,000 is unduly
restrictive and offsets the advantage of having a general fund. The proposed amendment would authorize a company to establish
and maintain one, or more than one general
fund, or common trust funds, and these in turn
are subject to the limits imposed by the laws
of the province in which the trusts are being
administered.
As to investment in common stocks, the
change made here is the same as was made
in the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, in that the expression "regular
dividends" has been dropped. The test now
is to determine whether or not, for a period
of seven years directly preceding purchase,
the common stocks have paid dividends of at
least 4 per cent of the value at which they are
carried on the books. It is further provided
that not more than 30 per cent of the common
stock, and not more than 30 per cent of the
total issue of the stock of any one company,
shall be purchased by any trust company.
The provisions dealing with the investment
of a company's own moneys have been

changed in a way similar to that in which
the corresponding provisions in the Canadian
and British Companies Act was recently
changed. These provisions set out the securities in which money may be invested.
Hon. Mr. David: Is there anything in the
amendments about trust companies paying a
percentage on deposits?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: There is no mention in this
particular amendment about any change in
the deposit basis.
Another provision has to do with the
ability of one trust company to purchase the
shares of another. Existing legislation permits an agreement between two companies
for the purchase by one company of the
assets, property and rights of the other.
But the amalgamation or merger of two companies is now a long and drawn-out affair.
Consequently it has been thought advisable
to place in this measure a provision authorizing one company to purchase the shares of
another. This provision is hedged about with
fairly stringent restrictions.
First of all,
such a purchase has to be authorized by the
Treasury Board on a report from the Superintendent of Insurance, supported by certain
evidence. The matter must then be submitted
to the shareholders of the two companies
concerned, and a stipulated percentage of the
shareholders of each company must approve
of the proposed sale.
Honourable senators, I believe I have
covered the main features of this bill, but
there are a few other amendments to which
I might refer very briefly. There has been
some slight doubt as to whether a trust company might issue fully paid-up shares. This
has been cleared up. There is a new provision which authorizes the directors of a
trust company to elect from among themselves a chairman of the board of directors;
and the voting powers of the person presiding at a meeting of the shareholders are
defined. Another new provision is to the
effect that a bylaw, when passed, ceases to
be in force at the date of the next general
meeting unless it is ratified at that meeting.
A further amendment adds the word "Newfoundland" to the provinces and territories
already named in the Act. There is also a
new provision dealing with the transmission
of shares or securities of a company in the
event of the decease of a shareholder, and
the document of transmission is defined.
These provisions are the same, in substance,
as the provisions for this purpose in the
Companies Act, 1934. There are also several
amendments to correct errors in the language
of the Act.
Honourable senators, while I am on my
feet, it might be in order for me to say that

JUNE 12, 1950
the Loan Companies Bill, which is to be
dealt with next, is similar to this one. It
purports to accomplish the same things in
respect of loan companies incorporated under
the Loan Compantes Act as this bill does in
respect of trust companies. The Loan Companies Act governs five companies which
were created by dominion legislation or by
letters patent before the present dominion
legislation came into effect.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, apart from listening to the explanation
just given by the honourable senator from
Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo), I have had little
opportunity to study these bills. It seems to
me that we should approach this legislation
with a sense of grave responsibility. We
should take warning from what happened in
the United States when that country widened
the powers of the banks to invest in real
estate, for it was that action, more than anything else, which led to the banking crisis in
the United States-and I do not mean a sham
crisis-at the time President Roosevelt took
over with his New Deal.
It may be that these provisions which deal
with real estate are hedged with restrictions
and care. I sincerely hope so. The regulation permitting a trust company to add a
second mortgage to a first mortgage is not
particularly important, because I think that
by well-established mortgage law the two
mortgages become a first mortgage when
they are owned by the same mortgagee or
assignee of the mortgage. The section providing that the rules with respect to the
holding of a first mortgage apply to the
second mortgage, when the two are merged,
is not of great importance.
The other provisions dealing with investment in real estate, however, are fraught
with a great deal of danger. I do not know
just how far the federal authorities go In the
matter of investigating trust companies that
are incorporated by the dominion; but In
Ontario the Attorney-General's Department
inspects the books of the companies and
issues an annual report about their financial
standing.
I have some keen recollections of the
problems that were placed on the desk of the
Attorney-General as a result of the study of
the books of trust companies. The very
name "trust" seems to imply something to the
public, who are apt to assume that a trust
company is in a different class from any other
company, and sometimes accord it their trust
to a degree beyond what an actual examination of the facts would justify. Can the
honourable gentlemen tell me whether the
federal department conducts an investigation

into the books of trust companies incorporated by parliament? If there is no such
investigation, it seems to me that we should
be still more careful in extending the companies' powers as proposed here. It is a
strange thing that optimism frequently carries
people away when they make an investment
in real estate, and it is a fact that in times of
crisis no other investment will shrink more
rapidly. That is why we have provisions that
somebody else must hold an equity which
fades out before the trust company's investment is lost.
Before I agree to the slightest extension
of the powers of these companies to invest
in real estate, I should like to know how far
the federal department goes in the investigation of their accounts. Can my honourable
friend tell me that?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: My honourable friend's
question caused me to look at the Act itself,
in the Revised Statutes, and I find there are
elaborate provisions for the inspection of
trust companies by the Superintendent of
Insurance and his staff. I am informed by the
department that the companies are inspected
regularly. If my honourable friend will look
at sections 72 to 78, inclusive, of the basic
statute, he will find there a complete code
governing inspection by the superintendent.
And if my recollection serves me correctly,
the provincial statutues are pretty much in
line with the federal statutes in this respect,
or vice versa.
While I am on my feet I wish to make
further reference to section 8 of the bill and,
perhaps, to correct a wrong impression. I did
not intend to leave the impression that the
mortgage which the trust company can take
must necessarily be a first mortgage. The proposed change here would probably appeal to
my honourable friend from Toronto Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) less strongly than would
the empowering of trust companies to purchase two mortgages on a property, for under
the bill a trust company could purchase the
second mortgage on a property even though
the first mortgage were held by someone else,
always provided the two mortgages in the
aggregate do not exceed 60 per cent of the
value of the real estate. The view taken is,
I think, that this 60 per cent is ample to
cover any probable fluctuations in real estate
values. As most of us know, in practice, trust
companies when investing in real estate get
an appraised value of the property, which in
general is substantially less than the market
value, and certainly less than the market
value under present conditions. To my
knowledge, few such lending institutions have
been prepared within the past few years to
lend up to 60 per cent of the market value.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I now have a quite
different impression from what I had after
the honourable gentleman had spoken before,
and it seems to me that the proposed change
is a very serious one. In effect it means that
trust companies will be able to invest in
second mortgages. The doubtful security of
second mortgages is made manifest by the
rates of interest which mortgagees charge and
mortgagors pay upon them. The limitation as
to 60 per cent of the value of the property
provides of course some protection, but not
a great deal, because a property does not
necessarily have to go down to 60 per cent
of its value before the second mortgagee may
have to meet a demand. For instance, if
payments on the first mortgage are not kept
up a call is made upon the second mortgagee
to meet those payments, and unless he does
so he loses his investment. If trust companies
take advantage, of their wider powers under
this bill they might, in times of depression,
have to add defaulted first mortgages to their
mortgage investments, and any company
which had not the necessary funds to do this
would be forced into bankruptcy.
I do not like this at all. This bill should
be examined in committee with very great
care, and we should exercise our most conservative judgment on this proposal to extend
the investing powers of companies which
have gained so much public confidence, partly
because of the inclusion of the word "trust"
in their names. Their conservatism in the
investment of funds, and their equitable and
excellent business practices of the past, have
helped to earn trust companies the good
reputation they now enjoy, and I should
sincerely regret it if extended powers of
investment resulted in ruining that reputattion. It seems to me that would become
a possibility if we passed this bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not take as serious a view as my honourable friend does of the proposed extension
of the power of trust companies to invest in
real estate, because the companies cannot
lend on any property more than 60 per cent
of its value. What I am worried about in
this bill is an amendment such as was in
the insurance bills that we passed the other
day. I repeat what I said when discussing
one of those bills, that the Bank of Canada
has driven the interest rate on government
securities down so low that trust, insurance
and mortgage companies cannot earn on
funds invested therein a sufficiently high
return to enable them to carry out their
contracts, and so are forced to seek new
forms of investment. That is the basic
reason for proposed changes in the Trust
Companies Act, as in the insurance companies Acts.

The danger that I foresee lies in the investment of increasingly large sums of money
in leased property. Some firms operating
chain stores have as many as ten, twenty,
thirty or more stores in a single city. Let
us suppose that the average cost of one of
these stores complete, land and building, is
$40,000, and that a trust company makes
a loan under the amended Act. The chain
store has a lease on the building for ten,
twenty or thirty years, at a rent which will
pay reasonable interest on the money, plus
the insurance premiums, taxes, and cost of
upkeep. If everything goes well the total
money lent will be paid back in, say, thirty
years, and in that event the investment will
prove a sound one. But the future is uncertain. A company which is making good
money today, paying a dividend of 6 or 8
per cent, with its stock of $100 par value
selling at $200, may run up against serious
difficulties a few years from now. It may,
for instance, be slow to take advantage of
changed methods of marketing, and in consequence its revenues may fall to such an
extent that it is unable to pay rent. If that
should happen, the lending institution that
put money into the company's stores, will
have to take over in a single community
ten, fifteen, twenty or more buildings that
are suitable for use only as chain stores.
Buildings of this type may be seen in my
city, as in Toronto and all other cities
throughout Canada.
My experience with trust companies has
been a happy one. I am more afraid of the
effect of increased investment powers upon
insurance companies than upon trust companies, the reason being that an insurance
company, because of the chance to sell a
policy, might lend on a property on which
a trust company would not. On the other
hand, if a trust company makes a poor deal,
its shareholders will have to pay for it. I
know most of the trust companies incorporated by dominion charter, and I believe
that they are the ablest-managed institutions
in Canada. I have no doubt that all the
companies have approved of this legislation.
The clause governing the lending of money
on real estate, which I am criticizing, is a
very limited provision. A trust company
is not allowed to invest more than 5 per
cent of the book value of its funds in real
estate, or 25 per cent of its capital and
reserve. The bill provides that a company's
total investment in any one parcel of real
estate shall not exceed one-half of 1 per
cent of the total of the company's own funds
and guaranteed trust moneys. It is a limiting
provision.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is opening the door.

JUNE 12, 1950
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that. But there is a
practical advantage to be gained. For instance,
a trust company, acting as executor in the
winding up of an estate, may have to deal
with a piece of property worth, say, $100,000,
which is mortgaged for $30,000. The people
who hold the mortgage, which may have three
or four years to run, refuse to consent to it
being paid off, and the estate cannot be
wound up until the mortgage falls due. The
trust company may have a purchaser who is
prepared to pay a deposit of $40,000 on the
property, but who does not wish to take it
subject to a second mortgage. If the trust
company was allowed, it could take a second
mortgage for $30,000 and wind up the estate.
I have known many cases where a property
carried a first mortgage of about 40 per cent
of the value of the property and a second
mortgage of about 5 per cent; yet the trust
company, acting as executor of the estate,
could not take up the second mortgage. I can
appreciate the attitude of people who are
making 5 per cent on a good investment,
and who refuse to cancel it and re-invest
their money at, say, 4 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You would want a
bonus?

Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, I would. The trust
companies have run into such difficulties as
I have mentioned, and for that reason they
are no doubt anxious to take advantage of
such powers as this bill would grant them.
I think the bill should be referred to the
appropriate committee, and I suggest that my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) should attend. At that time
we can ask the officials of the trust companies
just what is their attitude towards this legislation, and why they want it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
8, 1950, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the second reading
of Bill 252, an Act to amend the Canadian
Wheat Board Act, 1935.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
with all due respect to my colleagues in this
chamber, there are very few who are sufficiently familiar with the wheat problem to
discuss it in any detail. Those of us who come
from the Prairie Provinces are of course
deeply concerned about it, because it is our
very lifeblood.
The passage of this legislation will mark
the winding up of the British wheat agreement as of July 31, 1950; but before I discuss
the history of the agreement, which is now
all but closed, I wish to refresh the memories
of honourable senators on a few points.
In 1935, in the dying days of the Bennett
government, a bill was introduced in parliament to form a compulsory wheat board for
Canada. At the behest of the then leader
of the opposition, and afterwards Prime
Minister, the Right Honourable Mackenzie
King, the bill was referred to a committee,
and later was reported back to the house.
At that time the late Honourable J. L. Ralston
-then one of the leading opposition members
and later Minister of Finance for a time and,
during World War II, Minister of National
Defence-spoke in the House of Commons.
His remarks appear at page 3581 of Hansard
of 1935, as follows:
I do not believe that the people of the Dominion
of Canada are favourable to a compulsory wheat

board, to a board the constitution of which will

mean that every wheat grower, every elevator man
and everybody engaged in the wheat business must
deal with the government agency and nobody else
...
I do not believe the compulsory feature of this
bill will meet with approval, either in the west, in
the east or In this bouse.

My second quotation is from a speech by
the Right Honourable J. G. Gardiner, which
appears in the House of Commons Hansard
for 1939 at page 2613. He said:
There you have the issue clearly drawn between
the two parties at that time in the bouse: one-

The Conservative partywas for compulsion the other-

SENATE
The Liberal partywas for a continuance of the voluntary system.
I have read those two extracts-which I
also read in this house in 1947-because they
are of some historical significance in relation
to wheat legislation.
The compulsory wheat board bill which
the then prime minister introduced in 1935
was amended in committee and came back
to the house as a voluntary measure. It
enabled those who wished to do so to participate in it. That legislation was approved by
the chief spokesmen for the opposition in
the house at that time, and was passed. In
1939 when the King government was in
power, some minor amendments were made
to it. We find that the first serious amendment took place in 1942, and that in 1945 the
act was made compulsory.
At that time the Canadian government
made an agreement with the British government for the purchase of 160 million bushels
of the 1946 crop at $1.55 per bushel. By
reason of the fact that some of the wheat was
shipped in the form of fiour, and Great
Britain in this way lost the bran and shorts,
she actually took about 169 million bushels.
In 1947 Great Britain agreed to take 160 million bushels at the same price as was paid in
1946, but she actually took 170 million
bushels.
A new agreement was to be negotiated in
December of 1947, and the government
agreed on the price of $1.25 per bushel for
the 1948 crop. The new agreement contained
a clause to the effect that the loss of profit to
the producer on the 1946 and 1947 crops
would be taken into consideration. The government of Great Britain paid, in 1948, only
$2 a bushel for 140 million bushels, and the
next year they paid $2 a bushel for the 1949
crop. That covers the four years.
As I have been accused of quoting from
grain trade journals, I shall cite the Wheat
Board's own report of 1948-49. The average
price obtained by the board for wheat in
1946-47 was $2.43 per bushel, though they
admit that during that year some wheat sold
at from $2.05 to $3.10 per bushel. But the
average price of the surplus sold by them
outside the British agreement and other than
to the Canadian consumer was $2.43. On the
sales that year to the British buyer the board
lost 87 cents per bushel on 170 million
bushels, a total of $147 million. In 1947-48
their average selling price, according to their
own records, was $2.88 per bushels; and, by
reason of the British agreement, the farmers'
loss was $236 million; or, for the two years
together, $383 million.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What is my friend
quoting from?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am quoting from the
board's own report. The loss is based on the
price for which, according to their own
admission, the surplus wheat was sold.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You are reading a
newspaper.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. That is just a letter
I wrote to The Western Producer,.quoting the
board's figures.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I am sorry I asked
the question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I could refer more quickly
to the figures in the letter than in the report.
The point I am making is that in those two
years the farmers of Western Canada were
deprived of $383 million. In the following
year, 1948-49, they lost about $73 million. I
am not referring to the world price; I base
my figures on what the board got for what it
sold. Nobody can criticize that basis of
comparison. In 1948-49 the board's price
ranged from $1.91 to $2.48 per bushel, and the
average amounted to $2.23 for 140 million
bushels, a loss of 23 cents per bushel. This
increases the loss by about $32 million. From
figures available to the end of April, 1950
it appears that further losses have been taken
this year.
Because of the British wheat agreement,
the farmers of Western Canada have been
deprived of $488 million which they would
have received had our grain been sold on a
world's market-not at the peak of prices, but
at what the board actually got for the wheat
they sold other than to the United Kingdom.
This loss does not take into account the 80
million bushels sold to the Canadian people
at $1.55 a bushel, of which amount the buyer
paid 77 cents and the government, by subsidy, contributed the balance. It may be said
that the government had the right to say to
our people "You shall sell your produce at so
much," and I will leave out of the reckoning
the losses on that transaction.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Was the price not $1.25
the first year?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes for the first three
months, but I have taken the figure of $1.55,
because we are dealing in millions and I do
not want to get into a controversy over a few
dollars.
At the end of this crop year the money
held by the Wheat Board will be divided
among those who sent grain to the board.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I beg your pardon?
Hon. Mr. Howard: I said "right".

JUNE 12, 1950
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable gentleman
is so seldom here that I did not recognize
his voice.
Allowing for all possible adjustments-for
I want to fully meet the arguments of those
who support the board-the wheat farmers
lost $147 million in 1946, $236 million in 1947,
$73 million in 1948 and $32 million in 1949.
That adds up to $488 million. Including the
crop year 1945-46, which is properly taken
into account, and the present year, our
farmers have delivered to the board 1,293
million bushels, and on that amount have
taken a loss of 37 cents per bushel. Consequently, every western farmer who sent the
board a thousand bushels of wheat in any one
of the five years lost $370; and if a farmer
delivered 2,000 bushels each year-some producers sent much more-his loss over the
five-year period will be $3,600, for no part of
this money will ever be paid.
When, in 1947, the wheat agreement was
being discussed, we were told, "Wait till the
end of the period, and that 'having regard to'
clause will take care of all this loss." Honourable Mr. Howe, Minister of Trade and
Commerce, went to Britain the other day.
What did he say then he came back? He
told us: "The Wheat Board is wound up"or words to that effect; perhaps I should have
said "The British agreement is wound up".
To speak candidly, I take some credit for
f oresight in -this matter. The result bears out
exactly what I predicted when, standing in
my place here, I said: "This is economically
the worst agreement that has ever been
entered into by a Canadian government on
behalf of the producers of this country." The
facts prove that what I said is true. We were
told that we were going to get a permanent
market. The farmers of Western Canada
thought they were assured of a continuing
good price; the agreement would create so
much goodwill in the Old Country that never
again would Britain refuse to take our grain.
They did not know the Englishman. But
the man who preached this doctrine most
strongly in Western Canada was himself an
Englishman: he ought to have known, and he
did know. You say the farmers are in favour
of this, but you have only to read today's
edition of a magazine issued by the co-operatives in Winnipeg to see that they are sick
to death of the whole thing. They have been
bamboozled, and they know it, and they do
not know what is going to happen next.
I was not surprised at what the British did
about the Canada-United Kingdom Wheat
Agreement. In 1947, when we were discussing this agreement on the motion for second
reading of the Wheat Board Bill, I did not

ask that the house divide, because the government of the day had entered into a
specific contract and I could not for the life
of me bring myself to say that we should
repudiate it. Had I asked for a vote, I would
have been defeated; but when the motion
was agreed to, I said "On division."
I want to say without conceit that I think
I am the only member of parliament who
stood up and fought this wheat agreement
right from the start. I have been accused
by the Saskatchewan newspapers which support this bill of being a Winnipeg lawyer in
the employ of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.
In answer to that charge let me say that in
my 21 years of private law practice I have
never had one client in the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange. I challenge any man to show
that I have deviated one iota from the stand
I took at the very outset-that the CanadaUnited Kingdom wheat agreement was a
humbug and was in opposition to all the
laws of economics.
Wheat can be grown practically anywhere,
and the world produces about 6,000 million
bushels a year; but we all know that it is a
most difficult problem to set a value on
wheat. However, I shall come to this point
shortly.
Honourable senators, the Government of
Canada should make good the $488 millions
that the farmers of Western Canada have
lost in the last five years under this wheat
agreement. During the election campaign
last summer our farmers were promised that
they would be given an advance. Well,
between April and June the government did
give then an advance of twenty cents a
bushel, but nothing was said about the fact
that this advance would mean that all the
money in the Wheat Board would be taken
out and that the account would be overdrawn
by more than $5 million. I make the humble
prediction that when all the money is divided
this July 31, less than 5 cents a bushel will
come out of the Wheat Board. I think it will
be 4 cents a bushel. And this is for all the
grain that was sent to the Board during these
past years. You do not have to accept my
figure. If you refer to page 8 of the Board's
own report you will see that the deficit of
the 1945-49 pool account to July 31, 1949,
was $5,235,621.37.
All the money in the
Board was paid out, and the account was
overdrawn by $5 million. Was anybody
warned that this would happen?
Hon. Mr. Horner: And they had to pay
interest on the money that was borrowed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I attended many
public meetings, and I heard government
supporters boasting about the advance of 20

SENATE
cents a bushel. But they never uttered one
word about overdrawing the account by $5
million. I do not blame the government so
much for this as I do certain westerners,
especially the Minister of Agriculture and the
Minister of Trade and Commerce. They
knew what would happen, but they never
tried to avoid it.
The wheat pools of Manitoba, Alberta and
Saskatchewan supported this agreement to
the hilt. The farmers thought "We will get
$1.55 a bushel this year and $2 a bushel next
year. There will be plenty of money in the
pool and we will get well paid for years to
They lost
But what happened?
come".
money on every bushel they sent to the
elevators. This money just went down the
drain.
What will happen next? We have entered
into an International Wheat Agreement under
which four wheat-producing countriesCanada, the United States, Australia and
France-are the vendors, while approximately
33 nations are the purchasers. Depending on
certain factors, Canada is supposed to sell
either 203 or 206 million bushels a year.
Britain, buying 177 million bushels annually,
is the largest purchaser. Under the agreement the minimum price for our wheat this
year is $1.40 a bushel in United States funds,
and the maximum is $1.80 in United States
funds. If our money is at a discount the
minimum price will be $1.54 and the maximum $1.98. Next year the price will drop
another 10 cents a bushel.
Honourable senators, there is no question
at all that the Honourable Mr. Howe, Minister
of Trade and Commerce, is a very able man.
He has great ability; but he gets his business
and politics mixed up a little. I may be
wrong, but I think he does things better from
a business standpoint than from a political
one. He went to Britain, and if I read the
press reports correctly he came back with the
story that that country would take from 100
million to 120 million bushels of our wheat.
But no price was agreed upon. I shall tell
you in a minute or two just how the price
to be paid will eventually be established.
The grain growers in Western Canada have
said, "Men like Haig who preach against the
British Wheat Agreement are hirelings of the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange. They are bad
men, so don't have anything to do with them.
The Winnipeg Grain Exchange is against the
farmers". In the report of the Royal Grain
Inquiry Commission appointed June 27, 1936,
Commissioner W. F. A. Turgeon stated that
he could find one of the most economical ways
to sell grain. He made a wonderful report,
but where are we now? The Winnipeg Grain
Exchange is closed. Britain wants 177 million

bushels of wheat and is willing to take 100 or
120 millions bushels from us. What will the
price be? Will it be $1.40 or $1.80 a bushel?
I wish somebody would tell me his idea of how
the price will be arrived at. I suggest that it
will be based on the price of grain on the
Chicago Grain Exchange. The British and
Canadians will sit around a conference table,
and the Canadians will say, "We ought to get
$1.80 a bushel for our wheat"; but the Britishers will reply, "We ought to get it for
$1.40." An argument will ensue, and finally
some bright Canadian will remark, "Well,
what is the price of grain on the American
market?" and another Canadian will say,
"Well, wheat is selling on the Chicago market
for $2 a bushel, so we should get $1.80." Then,
because the Argentine is not a party to this
International Wheat Agreement, the British
representatives will argue, "Oh, no; we can
buy wheat from the Argentine for $1.20 a
bushel."
Ultimately we can ask Britain to take more
wheat under the agreement. But suppose she
says she can pay us only in sterling, and we
refuse to take it, what will happen? And
how are we going to be paid for wheat by little
countries that require up to 500,000 bushels
annually and have no American or Canadian
dollars? What will the procedure be? We
shall have to go back to asking the grain
exchange of the world to set the price. And
how do they set the price? Judging by some
of the wheat pool arguments, one would think
that the operators of grain exchanges sit
around a table like a lot of devils and say,
"Let us skin the farmer." But that is not so.
Men who buy grain are guided by their judgment of the future. They know there is so
much wheat in prospect in the United States,
in the Argentine, in Russia, in France in Canada, and in the world at large. At certain
times they may think there is going to be
a surplus.
Now, surplus is determined not only by the
quantity produced, but by demand. And
demand may fall, not because people do not
like to eat wheat bread, but because buyers
will not pay $2 a bushel for wheat when a
good substitute can be obtained at half the
price. The substitute may not be so good, but
circumstances may compel people to buy an
inferior food in order to have more money to
spend on other necessities. That is the kind
of thing that one is up against all the time
in this business. Men by the hundreds and
thousands, even in my lifetime, have tried to
guess what would happen on the world's
wheat market, but I never saw anyone make
money out of it. True, some men in the grain
trade are rich, but they made their money out
of handling the grain itself in elevators, and

JUNE 12, 1950
so on, which they owned. I am talking of men
who went on the market and tried to judge
what would happen.
Farmers like a stabilized price, for it saves
them from the work of thinking. If you are
a farmer you don't like to have to do a lot
of heavy thinking when you come in at
night, dead tired. It is a pretty wearisome
business to have to sit down then and try
to figure out whether you should sell your
wheat at 90 cents or hang on in the hope of
getting a dollar. The honourable gentleman
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) can tell you
what happened in 1929. Stories that I could
tell you of fellows who have cried over my
shoulder about the 1929 situation would
make you sick.
Let me mention, in passing, one little incident concerning a farmer who lived in a
Saskatchewan town which I will not name.
He bought a piece of land from a client of
mine, and I was the trustee to collect the
money for the vendor. The farmer sent me
2,000 bushels of wheat-the vendor's share
under the contract-and I immediately shipped it off to Fort William and sold it. In
October 1929 the price at Fort William was
approximately $1.25 a bushel, and I wrote the
farmer and told him his wheat had been sold
for $2,500, for which amount I was giving
him credit under his agreement. He wrote me
back a letter taking my head off. He said:
"You are another of those lawyer crooks
living in Winnipeg. You had no business to
sell my wheat at $1.25. You knew it was
going at $2, and you allowed the grain
exchange to rob me of 75 cents a bushel.
You have got to give me credit for another
$1,500." I replied, drawing his attention to
the agreement. I said: "This agreement gave
me sole authority to sell the grain, and I
have sold it. Now, get your lawyers and sue
me." That was in October 1929. By April
1930, as the honourable gentleman from
Churchill knows, wheat was down to about
90 cents. Then the farmer wrote me again.
In his former letter he had addressed me as
"Haig," but this time he called me "Dear
Haig." He now asked for my advice, whether I thought he should sow a hundred acres
in wheat, fifty acres in barley, and fifty acres
in flax, saying he had a very high regard for
my valuable judgment.
You may think that is an isolated case, but
it is not. The wheat pools of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta lost $23 million,
and the provincial governments had to come
to their assistance. Manitoba bought about
$34 million worth, Saskatchewan about $11
or $12 million, and Alberta about $7 or $8
million. The pools lost all this money because,
instead of selling wheat when they could
have got $1.25, they waited until the price

fell to 90 cents. The grain men did exactly
the same thing, and many of them lost their
shirts and were ruined. Those men knew a
lot about the grain business, but in gambling
· n the price they lost. And what I do not
like about this legislation is that it places on
the shoulders of the government the responsibility of gambling on the price, for there
can be no assurance as to what the future
price may be. The tendency of the government-and it would be my tendency too, if
I were in the government's position-will be
to sell at less than the highest price that
they might get, because they will be uneasy
and anxious to get rid of the wheat.
The next question is: Where is the money
for our wheat to come from? Under the
Marshall Plan it will have to come from the
United States. If European countries are not
given enough Marshall Plan money to buy
our grain, they will buy from the United
States, which country is going to have the
largest carry-over in its history. In fact, it
already has it, and attempts are being made
right now to plug our elevators full of American corn and other products.
I think it would be much better if the
people of Canada were to say to the wheat
growers of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta: "By federal legislation during the
war we took out of your pocket at least $500
million, and in the next four or five years,
when it may be difficult to sell wheat, we are
going to pay you back that money." If that
were done, people like me would be shut off
from cause for complaint. Maybe it is not
worth $500 million to get me to stop talking,
but the effect upon our Western farmers
would be far more beneficial. But instead,
here we are entering into another agreement
by which we are gambling on future conditions. If there is a crop failure in Western
Canada, in the United States, in Europe, in
the Argentine, in Australia and in Russia,
we may get $1.80 for our wheat; but if there
is an abundant crop in all these countries we
shall be lucky if the purchasers can be compelled to pay $1.40. Now, why should the
government take the responsibility of running that risk? I cannot understand it at all.
Honourable senators, I have spoken longer
than I had intended. Before me are notes on
former debates, but I will not weary the
house by going into them at this time. In
1948, when the first international wheat
agreement was brought in, I did not expect
that the disaster would become as great as it
has. But there was the possibility of serious
difficulty, as there always is in the grain
trade. I hope that this business of handling
grain by the government-for the Wheat
Board is a government agency-will be

SENATE
appeared to be-I am not sure that it wascontrary to public opinion in that part of the
country, is magnificent.
As I have said before, I have no connections
with the grain exchange at all.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The grain exchange has
been supporting the Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They have been, but they
are getting a little sick of it.
Since 1929 neither I nor any of the partners
in my firm have drawn a dollar from the grain
trade. Our business is for the most part a
rural practice. I have heard the f armers
discuss wheat agreements generally in the
light of present day conditions, and they
always come back to the statement: "We do
not intend to let the grain exchange get started
again." Why they take that attitude, I do not
know. But now we may take prices from
Chicago or Kansas City, or perhaps Great
Britain will open an exchange in Liverpool,
and we will take our prices from there.
In closing, I repeat my tribute to the

as the market is buoyant there will be no
difficulty under the international wheat
agreement; but as soon as the market gets
sticky, thirty-three parties will find thirtythree different reasons for getting out from
under the contract, and we shall be left holding the bag. If the United States should
declare that it has a wheat surplus, there
would be no more Marshall Plan money for
the purchase of Canadian wheat. What would
happen then? We are told that we can
expand our sales to Britain, provided we
purchase more goods from that country; but
we have not shown much inclination to
increase our purchases. I want to say to
some of the senators from Ontario and Quebec that if the people of the Prairie provinces
get into difficulties in the marketing of their
grain, the manufacturers in central Canada
are going to have a headache too.

Defence explained the bill, after which it
was given second reading and was then
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. The committee in the
course of its detailed study of the bill, held
eleven meetings, and its report recommended
74 amendments. These were concurred in
by the Senate on December 6. On December
8, the bill was given third reading and was
sent to the House of Commons, but prorogation intervened before that house had time to
deal with it.
This session Bill 133, which is now before
us, was introduced in the House of Commons.
It is substantially the same as the bill that
we passed last session, but there are some
differences. After the bill J-5 was passed
by the Senate in December last, and before
the new bill was introduced in the Commons
at the present session, the Department of
National Defence recommended thirty-four
additional changes and these, as well as those
made by the Senate committee, are contained
in the bill before us.
In its consideration of this bill the House
of Commons made 66 more amendments, of
which 51 were recommended by officers of
the Department of National Defence, the
remaining 15 having been proposed by the
honourable members of that house. It will
be seen, therefore, that since the bill left
us on December 8 last 100 additional amendments have been made to it. A list of these
amendments was prepared, and a copy was
placed in the post office box of every senator,
so that all would be familiar with them. I
doubt if any good purpose would be accomplished by enumerating them. Honourable
senators who have looked at them will know
that some are of relatively minor importance,
being simply improvements in phraseology,
but that others are substantial.
In view of the careful consideration given
to the bill last session, I would suggest to
the bouse that, if it sees fit, it should give
this bill second reading this afternoon. The
amendments could then be considered in the
committee to which I intend to refer the bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I received the list of amendments, as all
honourable senators did, and have gone over
them. Most of them consist of the substitution of a better word for one used in the
original bill, but do not change the meaning of
the sections in which they appear.
The main principle of this bill-to bring
the three armed services under one minister
-we have already agreed to. Those who
have followed the news in the American press
know of the struggle which accompanied the
movement for the amalgamation of the
armed services of the United States-and I

do not think all the difficulties have been
ironed out yet. It is a credit to our defence
forces that, with very little opposition, they
have agreed to this new administrative procedure. Provision is made that in the event
of war, what might be called "assistant ministers" may be appointed.
As I have said, the principle of the bill has
been agreed to by this house, and the bill
was given careful consideration in committee
last session. The department was represented before the committee by the Hon. Mr.
Lapointe, and it was a great treat to hear
his explanation of the bill and his account
of the work that went into it. With all due
respect to the other place, I doubt if their
amendments are any more important than
those passed by this house last session.
I am going to vote for second reading of
the bill on the understanding that it will be
referred to committee, and I reserve the
right to voice my objection when the bill is
reported back to the house, should there be
any point on which I do not agree. It is true
that by giving the bill second reading we
have agreed to it in principle, but I specifically reserve for myself and all other
honourable members the right to object, if
we feel we should, to any provision of the
bill when it is reported back to the house.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill

WHEAT BOARD BILL

SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 252,
an Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board
Act, 1935.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, in
rising to speak to the second reading of this
bill I am conscious of its importance and of
the principle that underlies it. Nothing is
more important to a citizen of a free country
than that he be left free from interference
by his government in the doing of the things
that are for him a natural right It is because
the bill violates that principle that I rise in
my place now to speak against it. I hope
the house will be patient with me as I
attempt to sketch briefly the background of
this legislation, how the principle of a wheat
board has worked out in practice, and what
is involved in the bill before us.

JUNE 13, 1950
As anyone knows who is familiar with the
development of Western Canada, the marketing of wheat has been for the last fifty
years a difficult, involved and much-debated
problem. It is only a little over half a century since the Canada Grain Act was passed.
And at this point I want to pay tribute to a
man who has long since left this world, and
who was not infrequently criticized; I refer
to the late Sir Clifford Sifton. He it was who
in 1899 introduced the bill which has developed into the present Canada Grain Act. As
originally drafted, it gave certain privileges
and afforded some protection to the producers of wheat in the prairie provinces.
The early years of this century saw the
growth of an elevator monopoly. Perhaps
under the circumstances that was a not
unnatural development, but it created among
the grain producers of Western Canada a
sense of grievance, and I am bound to say
that in some respects their complaints were
well-founded. As a result there came into
being the farmers' grain handling company
known as the Grain Growers Grain Company, which began business in 1906. The
company had no government assistance; it
had to meet the competition of the existing
grain trade, as it battled its way to success.
In the year 1912 the Government of Saskatchewan appointed a royal commission to
examine into the problem of grain marketing
as it affected that province. The commission
was headed by the late Dr. Magill, subsequently a chairman of the Board of Grain
Commissioners.
My honourable colleague
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) was a
member of the government which appointed
that commission, and I am sure his recollection of it is still vivid. As a consequence of
the commission's report, a co-operative elevator company was formed in Saskatchewan.
It received some government assistance but
had complete autonomy in the management of
its business. The government aided it financially in the construction of elevators, .and
the company undertook to repay the advances,
with interest-as I recall, 5 per cent-over
a period of twenty years. The Saskatchewan
Co-operative Elevator Company grew and
developed and became one of the main
marketing organizations in the province. A
similar company was formed in Alberta, and
by the year 1914 grain growers' grain companies were operating in all three prairie
provinces. Both the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company, in Saskatchewan,
and the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company, in Alberta, were controlled
and directed by farmers. In 1917 the Grain
Growers' Grain Company and the Alberta
Co-operative Elevator Company united to

form what is now United Grain Growers
Limited. Parliament passed the charter under
which that union took place.
I come now to the hectic days that followed the first war. Wheat pools came upon
the scene in the Prairie Provinces in 1923.
In large measure they owed their origin to
movements which began in the United
States. The principle of the pools was that
the farmer signed a long-term contract, in
the first instance for five years, to deliver his
wheat irrevocably to an organization set up
by the co-operative group of farmers, and
known as a wheat pool. It operated on the
basis that an advance would be made to the
farmer as soon as he shipped his grain to the
pool. Bodies similar to the one in Saskatchewan were organized in Manitoba and
Alberta; and these three pools-I ask honourable senators to note this, because of its significance to something I shall have to say a
little later-organized a co-operative or joint
selling agency for the marketing of the grain
which they received. The plan by which the
wheat pool was developed, imposed a levy of
two cents on every bushel of grain, for the
purpose of building elevators. No one could
take any exception to that. In addition, a
deduction was made of 1 per cent of the
value of the grain for what was called a
commercial reserve. That practice continued
for several years.
In 1928 Western Canada harvested what
was the largest wheat crop in its history. It
happened that good crops were general in
the wheat-producing areas of the world. In
1929 an advance, which I believe amounted to
a dollar a bushel on the wheat delivered to it,
was made by the pools. The principle on
which the pool operated was simple. An
initial advance was made on the wheat
delivered to its selling agency, and any surplus that accrued from sales was distributed
on a pro rata basis to the farmers who had
contributed grain to the pool. But it so
happened that the advance made by the pools
in 1929 was too large. The world descended
from its dizzy peak of economic activity; the
stock market crashed in October; there were
bank failures in Europe; and with the general
economic decline the prices of grain collapsed, so that by the spring of 1930 the pools
by reason of the advances of $1 a bushel
which they had made, had exhausted their
credit with the banks. That was a most
difficult period for the pools. Scarcely before
the banks were able to turn around the pools
owed them $25 million over and above the
grain collateral they had lodged with the
banks.
Hon. Mr. Haig: $23 million.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) stated yesterday
that this deficit was $23 million. At any rate
the three provincial governments then bailed
the pools out. In other words they pledged
their credit to the banks so that the banks
would continue their advances to the pools in
order that they could carry on their operations. By 1930 the pools had hundreds of
elevators situated all over the three provinces.
The provincial governments quite properly
had taken as security the tangible assets of
the pools. These assets were practically confined to the elevators, and these as just stated,
had been pledged to the provincial governments against the guarantees the provincial
governments had given to the banks. That
left the pools in this situation. When the
crop of 1930 commenced to move they had
no credit with which to finance the grain as
it came into their elevators. It was then that
the representatives of the pools made their
pilgrimage to Ottawa. I have a vivid recollection of the election that was held at the
end of July, 1930.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who has not?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My recollection is quite
vivid, because at that time I retired temporarily from public life with the full consent
of the electors among whom I was a candidate.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: When the election was
over the late Lord Bennett was Prime Minister
of Canada, and the representatives of the
pools came to Ottawa and placed their problem before him. They told him they wanted
his assistance in order to get the necessary
credit from the banks to enable them to carry
on business. I am bound to say that that
was a proposition for which Mr. Bennett did
not have much liking, but he recognized a
critical situation and agreed to have the
government guarantee the account of the
Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, which
was the pool-selling agency. He agreed to
guarantee their accounts to the banks on the
condition that they would appoint the late
Mr. John McFarland as general manager of
the Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited.
There was nothing else for them to do but
agree, and from 1930 until 1935 the Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, with Mr. John
McFarland as manager, operated with a continuous guarantee from the federal government to the banks which were giving the
pools the money to handle their business.
There was no limitation in the charter of the
Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited as to
the kind of activities they could carry on.
This was the situation in the spring of 1935

when the Prime Minister and his party were
facing an election. The general consensus of
opinion at that time-I think even within the
Conservative party itself-was that their
chances in the election were most doubtful.
Then the idea of creating a Wheat Board
was evolved in the spring of 1930.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 1935.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, 1935. I thank my
honourable friend for his correction. It is
interesting to note that just fitteen years ago,
almost to this very day, parliament was
debating the first Wheat Board legislation
ever put on the statute books of this country.
It is interesting to read the debate that took
place at that time. The legislation, containing three or four important features, was
introduced by Mr. Bennett in a speech in
which he gave a great deal of statistical
information, and in which I may add, he used
certain passages which only he could use. It
was a compulsory wheat board, and marked
the first occasion in the history of this country that the principle of compulsion had
been evoked in proposed legislation having
to do with the marketing of farm products.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What about the wheat
board set-up in 1917?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That was in wartime, and
I am speaking about peacetime.
What was the attitude of the Liberal opposition in 1935 to these compulsory features of
the Wheat Board legislation? It was the traditional attitude of the Liberal party to legislation of that kind. They opposed it vigorously,
and if anyone wishes to read a good speech
on the subject he can look up the late Colonel
Ralston's reply to Mr. Bennett's speech on
the second reading of the bill. The Liberal
party was on sound ground in opposing this
compulsory legislation, because any legislation that seeks to coerce the individual in a
matter where his natural rights are concerned can never at any time or in any place
be called Liberal legislation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The opposition to the
measure was so strong at that time in the
House of Commons that, on the request of
Mr. Mackenzie King, who was then leader of
the opposition, the bill was referred to a
special committee where evidence was heard
and the bill overhauled. When it came back
from committee the bill was vastly different
from when it had been introduced to the
house. The compulsory features had not been
removed, but a compromise had been reached.
The compulsory features were left in the bill
-they will be found in the original Wheat
Board Act in clauses 9, 10, 11 and 16-but

JUNE 13, 1950
they were not made operative, and were to
go into effect only on proclamation. The
Prime Minister of that day may have given
some private assurance that they would not
be proclaimed until after the election. As I
say, the sections incorporating these coercive
powers in the original Wheat Board Act were
not to be brought into effect until proclaimed;
and, honourable senators, they have never
been proclaimed to this day.
One or two other changes were made in
the original legislation. One change, an
important one provided that the Wheat
Board was to be an agent of the producers
and could buy grain from producers only.
Now it is a matter of record that during the
period from 1930 to 1935, when Mr.
McFarland was General Manager of the
Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers
Limited, that organization was buying and
selling grain on the market, and the Liberal
opposition rightly took the position that it
was no business of the Canadian parliament
to guarantee money accounts for purposes of
that kind. At every stage of that wheat board
legislation the Liberal party of that time was
on sound traditional Liberal ground. When
the wheat board was established in 1935, Mr.
McFarland was appointed chairman, an
office in which he remained until some time
after the change in government which took
place in October that year.
The next event to which I wish to refer
occurred in September 1943.
It will be
recalled by the house that the so-called freeze
order-the controls to stabilize salaries, wages
and prices generally all over this countrywas brought into effect by an order in council
passed by the government in November 1941.
For a reason which I think will become
clear in a moment, wheat was exempted from
the operation of that order in council. Wheat
prices had been tending to rise, but all
through the dark, black 30's the farmers of
the prairie provinces had sold their wheat at
prices which at one time were lower than they
had been at any time in three hundred years.
The government felt-and, I think, rightly
felt-that the farmers should be given an
opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, to
some degree at least. As honourable senators
from Western Canada know, the farm mortgage debt at that time was at the highest
point it had ever reached in our history. So
wheat prices were allowed to rise until they
touched $1.23 a bushel. After the pricefreezing order went into effect, in 1941, the
price -of wheat to the mills for the manufacturer of domestic flour was stabilized at
the then existing level. The mills of course
had to buy their wheat on the market at the
advancing prices, but the government paid
the mills a subsidy so that the cost to them

of wheat for the production of four would be
76 to 77 cents a bushel, the price they were
paying when the freeze order became
effective.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 77 cents.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: By that means it was
possible to hold the price of bread to the
figure set by the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board.
That was the condition until September
1943. It may be of interest to the house to
know that the 1943 order in council closing
the Winnipeg futures market in wheat and
putting sole control of the marketing of
wheat under the Wheat Board was passed to
keep the price of wheat from going higher.
I supported that legislation and I am prepared to defend it now. At that time wages
were controlled, although cracks in the control appeared here and there, and prices in
general were controlled, and the wheat price
had so risen that in the government's judgment it also should be controlled. Control
legislation was therefore enacted, and it remained in effect until we passed the Wheat
Board Act amendments, occasioned by the
British wheat agreement, which was in 1946.
Yesterday my honourable friend the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke about
the British wheat agreement. I disagree with
him on only one point. I cannot follow
him in his proposal that the treasury of
Canada should now make up to the farmers
of Western Canada what they lost under the
British wheat agreement.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I can give my 'reasons.
There can be no question that under the
British wheat agreement our western farmers
suff ered heavy loss, as compared with nearly
all other classes of the population. The agreement provided that starting with the lst of
August 1946, the beginning of the crop year,
Canada would sel wheat to Britain for four
years. In each of the first two years Britain
was to take 160 million bushels, at a price
of $1.55 a bushel at Fort William; and in the
third and fourth year 140 million bushels,
annually, the price for which was left open,
to be settled by mutual agreement. That is
where the famous "have regard to" clause
came into the agreement. Britain stated
that when the time came to negotiate the
price for the third and fourth years she
would be willing to have regard to how the
price at which she obtained Canadian grain
for the first two years compared with the
world price. In the negotiations for the
price for the third and fourth years Britain.

SENATE
claimed that she had regard to this point,
as the price for those two years was raised to
$2 a bushel.
But during the whole currency of the British wheat agreement and up to a few days
ago there was not a time when class 2 wheat,
that is wheat marketed by the board outside
the British wheat agreement, did not command a higher price-at times a very much
higher price-than was secured under the
agreement. There can be no question of that.
I know it has been argued that because of
the existence of the British wheat agreement
there was no world price for wheat. That
is just nonsense. In the "have regard to"
clause of the British wheat agreement the
British government stated that it would have
regard to the world price of wheat, and certainly there was a world price of wheat.
And during the currency of the agreement wheat was sold to countries other than
Britain, countries which had traditionally
been buyers of Canadian wheat-Holland,
Belgium, Norway, Denmark and others-and
the price obtained from sales to them was
known as the No. 2 price. And at one time, I
think it was in the crop of 1947, the No. 2
price for wheat sold outside the agreement
went as high as $3.40 a bushel. The amount
of the loss which the farmers suffered under
this agreement, as given by the leader
opposite yesterday, was I think well within
the mark, and could be shown to be beyond
any reasonable doubt.
A further pertinent criticism is that under
the policy adopted by the government, the
Canadian flour mills bought their requirements from the Wheat Board on the basis
of the prices fixed in the first two years
by the terms of the British wheat agreement,
and this applied also in the last two years
when the price paid by Britain was arrived
at by arrangement. So we have this situation which is beyond contradiction, that the
farmers of western Canada have bonused not
only the bread consumers of Great Britain as
against the world price, but also the bread
consumers of Canada. I know that here and
there some individuals are impatient with
the wheat growers, who in some quarters are
criticised as an unreasonable lot of people. I
think that is entirely unjustified.
As to the financial losses suffered by the
prairie wheat producer by reason of the
marketing policies adopted by the government, there can be no question. I repeat that
from the very day the wheat agreement was
entered into until almost the present moment,
wheat has been marketed independently
every year at prices higher than that which
Great Britain paid. True, a change has taken

place within the last week, when Class 2
wheat came down to the level of other wheat
under the agreement.
What was the origin of the British wheat
agreement, and why did we ever get into a
tangle of this kind? The only reason that I
have ever heard for the government going
into a compulsory wheat agreement is that
the farm organizations, the wheat pools and
the Federation of Agriculture asked for it.
The request of these bodies was taken as the
considered judgment of all the farmers in
western Canada. Well, that is a pretty large
order, and cannot be sustained. But even
granted this, is a government justified thereby
in doing something that may hurt an individual who has had nothing to do with such
organizations? Is the government-any government in peace time-justified in taking
away from a farmer any of his natural rights,
even at the request of organizations such as
the wheat pool and the Federation of Agriculture? Therein lies my profound opposition
to the principle involved in this legislation.
I repeat that the only reason that has ever
been given for this legislation is that it was
requested by farm organizations. I emphasize
that it is not good enough for any government
-whether Liberal, Tory or C.C.F.-to take
arbitrary action, merely at the request of
some organizations, which affects adversely
thousands of individuals. I hold that view
very strongly, as perhaps my honourable
friends in this house may have guessed
before this time.
Now I wish to examine the wheat board
powers for a few minutes from another angle.
I have not the slightest objection to the wheat
board as it existed prior to the beginning
of World War II. It was then a producers' board, and any farmer or farm organization who wished to use it for the marketing of his or their grain could do so. The law
did not compel individual farmers to market
their wheat by that medium. That it does so
now is my profound objection to this legislation.
Let us consider for a few moments the
amendments passed to the Canadian Wheat
Board Act in 1946, and the very flowery
language of the preamble which at that time
gave as the reason for the amendments the
implementation of the British wheat agreement. The amendments were not necessary
even to carry out the terms of the agreement,
for there was no reason at any time why the
wheat board could not have gone out, purchased wheat at the going price and filled
the contract of our government with the government of Great Britain within the terms of
the agreement. But under the cloak of the

JUNE 13, 1950
carrying out of the agreement, these mandatory and compulsory features were put
into the wheat board legislation. I could
spend fifteen minutes discussing the character of these amendments, but I choose to use
a few illustrations.
I am a farmer in Manitoba-and if I have
any occupation besides being a senator, it is
farming-and I have always had great respect for the farm people, the pioneers who
cleared the vast areas of this country. Under
the law as it exists today, I cannot market
a bushel of my wheat, a bushel of my oats,
or a bushel of my barley until I obtain from
the wheat board a permit to do so. I ask
honourable senators, is that not going pretty
far? Why should I as a producer of grain be
compelled by law to go to a government
board and obtain a permit to market my
grain at an elevator a few miles from my
farm? Have we ever passed similar legislation for any other class of people in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Howard: The provinces have.
Hon. Mr. Wood: And other countries have.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I say that it would be just
as reasonable for parliament to set up a
board imposing wages and hours of work
on working men as it is to set up a board
which says that I cannot market the products
of my labour without a permit to do so.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Will my honourable
friend permit me-?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I would rather not be
interrupted at this point.
Here is another example of the coercive
nature of this legislation. If I wish to buy
100 bushels of seed wheat from a farmer in
Saskatchewan, I cannot do so without the
permission of the wheat board; and if I
violate the law I can be fined or sent to jail,
or if the magistrate considers my offence
serious enough I may be both fined and
imprisoned. What justification in reason can
be offered for arbitrary, coercive legislation of that kind that penalizes me for
doing a simple thing that is my natural right
to do? When the bill which sanctioned the
British wheat agreement was under discussion, the only reason advanced was that
these powers were necessary in order to give
effect to the agreement and that claim never
had any valid basis.
I come now to the present bill. It not only
confirms and maintains ail those arbitrary
principles which I have been discussing, but
for good measure it adds a few more. The
amendments are not very important if you
accept the Wheat Board Act as it stands and
as it will remain until the end of July. By
virtue of amendments passed in 1946 the
55950-31

compulsory features of the legislation were
to cease to have effect on July 31, 1950,
which is about six weeks away: the board
would then revert to what it was before.
Hon. Mr. Maig: A voluntary board.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A producers' voluntary
board-which is what it should be. But the
provisions of the present bill extend the time
from July 31, 1950 to July 31, 1953, because
this famous International Wheat Agreement
has operated for only one year and has yet
three years to run. Also, the pool period is
to be changed, but that is not of so much
consequence.
Under the British Wheat
Agreement a five-year period was established.
Under the International Wheat Agreement
the pool period is one year. If there must
be a system of this kind, the change, I am
bound to admit, is a desirable one.
There is another provision which I think
may be useful, assuming that we are to be
saddled with this incubus for another three
years. When the Wheat Board makes the
final payment which marks what may be
called the clean-up of the pools, it requires
the producer to present the certificate which
is issued to him when he markets his grain.
As my honourable friends from Western
Canada well know, a farmer may lose his
certificate; he may have moved elsewhere
and forgotten about it; he may have died.
The present bill provides that the Wheat
Board may waive the surrender by any individual fariner of his certificate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would not the Wheat
Board have the records?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Oh, yes, they have
records.
It is interesting, although not
astonishing in view of the hundreds of
thousands of farmers scattered all over
Western Canada, to note that last July there
were outstanding from the 1940, 1941, 1942,
1943 and 1944 crop accounts over $2 million
of potential claims that had not then been
filed. It is a safe assumption that the larger
part of that amount will never be claimed
by the farmers: either they have forgotten
what was due to them, or they have passed
away. I take it that this fund will at some
future time enrich the treasury of the
Dominion.
I have said that this legislation seeks to
spread the net still wider. Today, because
of amendments made in 1946 to the Wheat
Board Act, all elevators and flour mills, even
little gristing mills located at points away
from a railway, are declared to be "works
for the general advantage of Canada". By
the adoption of that magic formula they have
been brought under the control of the Wheat
Board. I stated in a previous debate that

powers in the United States, and I doubt
if they are found, to anything like the same
extent, in any of the other exporting
countries who are parties to the agreement.
This is one of the reasons I am opposing this
legislation.
How is the Wheat Board going to operate
when the Canada-United Kingdom Wheat
Agreement is terminated and the International Wheat Agreement is put into
operation?
How will the Wheat Board
determine the price at which to sell Canadian
wheat, because the maximum price is held at
$1.98 a bushel and the minimum at $1.54.
Where is the Wheat Board to get the information upon which it can base an asking
price from the countries who want to buy
our wheat somewhere within this price
range? It may be asked "How has the Wheat
Board been able to establish a price on the
Class 2 wheat which it has been selling each
year outside the British Wheat Agreement?"
The answer is that the asking price of the
Board was determined on the basis of the
prevailing prices of grain on the Chicago
and Minneapolis markets.
Here we find
ourselves in the situation where we have
to go to the markets of an outside country
to determine the value of the produce we
have for sale. The Wheat Board is faced
with the same situation as it faced when,
under compulsory orders, it was given the
marketing of oats and barley. How did
they determine the price of these commodities?
They left the future markets in
Winnipeg open.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are quite right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
do not want a single word of anything I
have said today to be even remotely considered as being a criticism of the Wheat
Board. In my opinion we have been fortunate in having the kind of Wheat Board we
have had.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am sure that anyone
who has taken the trouble to read the report
of the Wheat Board for the crop year 1948-49
will agree with me that in a frank and full
way it gives all the information relevant
to the problems of the Wheat Board. My
quarrel is not with the Wheat Board. During
the past year it handled the marketing of oats
and barley in a way that is to be commended. These feeding grains were scarce
and, despite what the Ontario and Quebec
buyers might have thought, the prices asked
were what the market warranted. There
is no place, whether it be at an auction or
any other place, where the price of any
55950-31à

commodity can be better determined than
on a market where open competition
flourishes.
Honourable senators, I come now to the
conclusion of my remarks. I apologize for
speaking at such length, but I do feel strongly
about this bill. This is not the kind of
legislation under which this country has
been developed. It has been the self-reliance
and initiative of our individual citizens
which in the space of eighty years has
developed our vast resources. If our forefathers or even our fathers had been asked
in their day to contemplate legislation of this
kind I am certain that they would have
trampled it into the dust. This is not the
way by which Canada has developed, and
it is not the way in which its greatness can
be preserved.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators,
not being from Western Canada, I suppose
I should not participate in this debate; but I
should like to make a few remarks about
certain features of the bill.
First of all I want to congratulate the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) on the splendid historical sketch he
has given us, and to join with him in his
strong protest against the manner in which
this legislation interferes with the personal
and private rights of our people.
I do not profess to know much about the
marketing of grain, and I do not know what
effect the operations of the Wheat Board have
had upon the resources of Western Canadian
farmers-this may be a debatable point; but
in my opinion the Wheat Board has conscientiously administered the Act in the interests of not only the farmers but all the
people of Canada.
Legislation vesting such extraordinary
powers in the Wheat Board was probably
necessary during the war period and for a
few years thereafter. It is my opinion, however, that as the emergency has ended-that
is, the war is over, and instead of a shortage
of grain we now have a surplus which we are
trying to dispose of on world markets-we
must consider restrictive measures of this
kind very carefully. I am strongly in favour
of private trading, and I think it would be
beneficial to all our people, including western
farmers, if we disgarded this restricted form
of trading that is now imposed upon the
marketing of our grain. It is interesting to
note that this measure goes so far as to vest
in a board power to refuse permission to
import grain from other countries. In other
words, an importer of grain from the Argentine, South Africa, or other countries, must
first obtain a permit from the Wheat Board

SENATE
before he can bring any grain into Canada.
That is a most extraordinary power, which is
bound to interfere with the normal trade that
has always existed between Canada and other
nations.
The particular section of the bill upon
which I wish to comment is the one that was
referred to by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), namely, section
8. This section declares that the mills, feed
houses and, as the honourable gentleman put
it, chicken hatcheries, are works for the
general advantage of Canada. I submit that
this house should be most careful in considering a proposal of this kind. It is, in my
opinion, an attempt to interfere with property
and civil rights, a direct invasion of provincial rights. If the Parliament of Canada
has control over all flour mills, feed mills and
so on, as stated in the section, it is not necessary to have a declaration of this kind in the
bill. I suggest that the object of this section
is to give to the federal parliament jurisdiction over operations which are matters of
property and civil rights, and entirely under
the jurisdiction of the provinces.
If in legislative matters the Senate is to
protect provincial jurisdiction, and property
and civil rights, this section should be examined by us very carefully and minutely. I
find it impossible to imagine that the mills
and "hatcheries" referred to can honestly be
declared to be necessary works for the general
advantage of Canada. They are plants which
operate exclusively under provincial jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction should not be
invaded by legislation of this kind.
I am greatly troubled to discover a reason
for such legislation at this time, unless it is
that grain is to be bought and sold and
entirely controlled by the Wheat Board.
But it does not seem necessary to tie up
all the facilities for the handling of grain,
as proposed by the bill. During all the time
that grain bas been merchandised by other
means in Canada, these same facilities have
existed, and they were able to carry on without any drastic legislation vesting complete
control over mills and warehouses in a board.
I submit that the continuation of control, as
provided for in section 8, is unnecessary for
the successful handling and merchandising of
the grain crops of this country. In the preamble to the amending legislation of 1947 it
was stated that the changes there set out
were needed by the government to enable it
to carry out the wheat agreement with the
United Kingdom. Now I think it is important to honourable senators to note that section
9 of the present bill repeals that preamble,
although the powers vested in the Wheat
Board are to be continued.

I urge that it is the duty of the Senate, as
a house of parliament, to examine this bill
very carefully and see that it does not contain any provision that is unnecessary or contrary to the facts. As a lawyer, I should say
that if in a case that came before the courts
there arose a question whether a certain flour
mill was within federal or provincial jurisdiction, the matter would be judicially
weighed on the evidence; but when the courts
are confronted with a declaration such as is
contained in section 8 they are inclined to
assume that before passing the section parliament took into account all the relevant facts
and that in the light of those facts a majority of members of both houses believed the
law to be necessary and proper.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, is
there a rush to give this bill second reading
today?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As my honourable
friend knows, I am always quite willing and
happy to accommodate honourable members
as far as possible. I had taken the liberty
of advising some interested parties that if
this bill were given second reading today it
would come before the Banking and Commerce Committee tomorrow morning. If it is
the desire of the house, I am quite agreeable
to have discussion on the bill continue this
afternoon and, if necessary, this evening. If
that is not the desire, I shall have to change
the arrangements made for tomorrow morning's meeting. While I had hoped that the
debate would be concluded this afternoon, I
am not pressing the point. I am in the hands
of the house.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
would humbly suggest to the leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) that he permit the discussion to
continue, even though this should make necessary some change in the time set for the committee meeting. I wish to say a word or two
on the bill along an entirely different line
from what has been said so far. This is an
important matter. I think that in our handling of this bill the very existence of the
Senate as a legislative body in the constitutional set-up of this country is at stake, and
we should make up our minds whether we
are or are not going to meet the situation. If
we do not do that, we are simply adding one
more statute to the record which one day may
be used against us.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
with leave of the house I move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Why not discuss the
matter now?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Very well, I will. I had
intended, before speaking, to get some

JUNE 13. 1950
information from the speeches delivered in
opposition to the board in 1935 by the late
Dr. Motherwell; however, honourable senators are no doubt f amiliar with that phase of
the question.
At the outset 1 wish to say that I do not
entirely agree with some of the remarks made
by the bonourable leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Haig), and in many respects I arn in
agreement with the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). It does seem,
that by some means he and I have got into
a world different from that which we had
pictured and believed in. I well remember
a remark made by the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen on one occasion, to the effect
that man was given either a scythe or a
cradie, and that with eitber he could earn bis
livelihood. But the amalgamation of huge
capital interests and organizations of varlous
kinds resulted in the setting up of combines
the details of which the best detectives cannot search out; and it was in this world that
the western farmer f elt the need of some
form of board or pool to market bis product.
I take issue with my leader on this side
when he says that farmers sometimes refuse
ta think. I presume he means that they
refuse to concern themselves witb the gamble
of the grain exchange. 1 say ta hlmi that the
farmers who do not think do not stay on the
farm; they are forced ta go into cities and
towns and enter the legal profession.
Some Hon. Sonators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The honourable senator
from Churchill spoke of the United Grain
Growers and the old co-operative elevators.
I have always been very proud of the record
of these organizations. I spent a great deal
of time organizing the co-operative elevator
in my district. This method of marketing
worked very well, and ail the elevators made
a good return on the capital investment. I
sometimes get letters asking me ta be loyal
to my co-operative elevator. But it was a
co-operative in name only, for the man who
took his grain to an independent elevator
shared in the benefits whicb the co-operative
sale of my wheat helped ta produce.
The co-operative elevator was managed by
a board, wbich held an annual meeting of
delegates sent fromn each elevator company.
I arn very proud of the part I took at the
last annual meeting, when I moved a resolution for the sale of the co-operative elevator
ta the wheat pool. That sale brought about
much better conditions for the farmers, and
I have neyer regretted my part in it. Only
those who draw wheat and remain loyal ta
their own company received any benefit from
or own any shares in the pool elevator.

The United Grain Growers is operated for
profit; its dividends are paid, not on the
basis of wbeat delivered but on the basis of
the money invested in the enterprise.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Will my honourable
friend permit me ta correct a remark? The
United Grain Growers today pay a patronage dividend.
Hon. Mr. Horner: My point is that that
scheme was adopted by the line elevators
after the pool elevators began to pay a dividend, the reason being that the line elevators
were forced ta compete witb the pool.
The honourable senator from Churchill in
his remarks said that wheat reacbed its lowest price during the thirties. I remember
that in the faîl of 1907 I bought wheat for
ten cents a bushel, and even at that price
there was no demand for it. In fact, it was
impossible ta take out a load of wheat and
sell it at any price; the elevators closed their
doors.
Han. Mr. Crerar: I apologize for interrupting my friend again, but if he will permit me,
I think it was in 1933 that wbeat on the
international markets dropped ta the lowest
point in 300 years.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: What year was that?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: 1933.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: 1932.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There was a financial
crisis in 1907, and the grain markets closed
down entirely. I do not know whether that
condition extended througbout the world, but
I well remember that it existed in my part of
the country.
My honourable friend also spoke about
grain organizations and the method of reporting crop conditions-adequate rainfaîl here or
drought there; that the farmer was thinking
of selling bis grain or of holding it, and s0 on.
But at one time, notwithstanding the fact that
the farmer puts every thing he bas into bis
wheat crop, there was no organization through
wbich he could sell it. Let me compare the
strong organizations behind the manufactured
products wbicb the f armer buys with the
uncertainty wbicb the farmer formerly faced
in the marketing of bis produce. For instance,
wben a farmer goes ta a machinery company
such as Massey-Harris, John Deere, MeCormick, or Oliver, ta buy a combine or any
other piece of equipment he finds that each
company's price is the same. The companies
are organized-if you wish, they have a pool
-and noone is able ta report that a million
combines are coming in from another country

SENATE
at a lower price, thus forcing down the market
and enabling the farmer to buy his machine
cheap.
How would the members of the legal profession like it if their services were offered on
a mart, as it were, where their services could
be bargained for? If that were to happen, we
might even hear that Haig was in poor shape
today and offer him low fees for his services.
Would our lawyer friends like to do business
in that way?
For thirty years a large percentage of the
farmers of Western Canada have, rightly or
wrongly, been opposed to the operations of
the Winnipeg Grain Exchange as the only
medium for the sale of their wheat. I remember that in 1917, 1918 and 1919 the wheat pool
provided the most satisfactory marketing
method the farmers of Western Canada had
ever had. Of course there was the usual
complaint that the Tories would not honour
the participation tickets, and many foolishly
gave them away. The scheme worked quite
well, and ever since that time the farmers
have been in favour of a board of some kind.
I do not intend to enter into a discussion of
how much the farmer may have lost, but I do
know about the low prices which he has
received. One of the worst years was 1937,
before McFarland was dismissed, when the
board gave away the wheat.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That was 1935.
Hon. Mr. Horner: My party was suffering
by reason of the poor market, and although
the West produced in that year 130 million
bushels of wheat, there was no farmer on the
board. At that time it was not a political
board, as it is today, and the farmers insisted
that they be represented.
I come now to coarse grains. Certainly, the
western farmer is not satisfied with what
is being done in the way of marketing his
coarse grains. The authorities today take
his products and sell them to the farmers of
Ontario for less money than the producer
could get for them. It is this sort of procedure that the western farmer objects to.
To understand the severe drought conditions in Western Canada in 1937, all that
anyone had to do was travel across the three
Prairie Provinces. There was no crop; it was
all burned up. At that very time there were
about 200 million bushels of wheat on hand,
and the board boasted that it had sold some
70 million bushels. In a press interview I
protested that this was a crime, because the
farmers who held participation certificates
thought they still owned the wheat and did
not wish to give it away. The understanding
was that when there was no crop, wheat
should sell at $1.25 or $1.50 per bushel; but
the board sold some wheat at 70 cents. In six

months the price went up to $1.54. The
farmers could not understand why in less than
a year the market went up as much as 75 cents
a bushel. The giving away of this wheat in
1937, to which the late Dr. Motherwell
objected, was little short of a crime. In my
opinion the western Canadian farmers lost a
great deal more money through what happened
in that year than they did from the operation
of the British Wheat agreement.
Not so long ago the British Government
wanted the United States to strengthen the
position of sterling in relation to dollars by
purchasing the great accumulations of rubber
which had piled up in Malaya. If need be, it
was suggested, the production of synthetie
rubber could be reduced. What is the situation today? There is not only no surplus of
rubber; there is a great shortage. If honourable senators who are interested in questions
of exchange could give a satisfactory explanation of such occurrences, I should feel more
content. It is beyond the competence of any
man, certainly of the individual farmer, to
protect himself from price fluctuations. One
farmer, more fortunate or perhaps wiser than
his neighbour, could sell his wheat on the
Grain Exchange for $1.50 a bushel; another
man, with perhaps the same family obligations, could get no more than a dollar. Under
such conditions there is bound to be dissatisfaction. It was experiences of this kind
which drove the farmers to the point where
they were willing to pool their grain. In
1931 or 1932 the pools operated on a monthly
basis. I wanted to pool my wheat on a yearly
basis; and I know that for eleven cars of the
best wheat I ever grew I got only 32 cents
a bushel. For the next crop I received up
to 70 cents a bushel. That was the period of
low prices of which the honourable senator
for Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has spoken.
I should not have pooled my wheat had I
realized that the organization was operating
on a month-to-month basis.
I do not object to some measure of government support of the pools. May I remind
honourable senators that, of all the loans
made to the pools by provincial governments,
every cent has been repaid. This much can
be said for the pools, that they managed to
pay their loans and give their farmer members better service than they received from
the line elevator companies. I assert that
without fear of contradiction from any
quarter. I advise any honourable senator
who is interested in the subject to get a
copy of the late Dr. Motherwell's speeches in
opposition to the treatment by the government of the Bennett Wheat Board after the
Liberals were returned to power in 1935.

JUNE 13, 1950
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: I shall not detain
the house for more than a few minutes. I
should like to draw attention to one oustanding aspect of the consideration of this bill;
I refer to the functions of democratic government in this country. I had intended to
speak today on another item on this agenda
which will be held over until next Monday,
and my remarks would have borne directly on
the responsibilities of the Senate in the Parliament of Canada.
The bill we are now considering raises
very definitely a point of view which might
be adequately expressed in the discussion on
the resolution submitted by the honourable
senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte),
who unfortunately, under most regrettable
circumstances, is absent.
As to the present bill, we have had from
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), as we usually do when he deals
with this subject, a very enlightening address.
He has described the sequence of events that
have affected the marketing of western Canadian wheat during this last forty years, and
which have led to the present situation. A
good deal of what he said is familiar to me,
because I was associated with him intimately
some thirty years ago in connection with the
development of the co-operative farm movement and in the creation, after the first war,
of the Wheat Board. He might have said
more about the first Wheat Board and
its effect upon the thinking and point of
view of the grain growers of middle western
Canada, because it was then and there that
the seeds of what was to come were sown.
All of us remember the circumstances which
surrounded the approval some five years ago
of the Canadian Wheat Board Act. I was
opposed to it. I thought, and still think, that
it gave sanction to a most regrettable transaction, which was simply the selling ahead
of time of five successive wheat crops; or, to
put it in an old parlance, selling the wheat of
Canada five years short,-something that a
private institution or group of people engaged
in the business would no more think of doing
than of cutting off their heads. It was a
most improvident and regrettable transaction; and we can now look back on the history of the last five years and estimate just
how unbusinesslike it was. The honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in
his speech yesterday referred to this chapter
of events; but I submit that when one happens to have been involved in a public transaction there is not a great deal of satisfaction,
either from a public or a personal point of
view, in being in a position to say "I told
you so". There may be some political advantage in ocupying such a position, but there is

very little that is either gratifying or exhilarating. The fact of the matter is that this
body, the upper chamber which is supposed
to represent the sober second thought of parliament, failed to do its duty in connection
with that legislation; and I think it will fail
to do its duty in connection with this bill.
I come now to the central thought of what
I have had in mind. When, five years ago,
the scheme embodied in the Wheat Board Act
was introduced, the only view that I know
of which was expressed here in opposition to
the bill was the view of those of us who
pointed out the unsoundness of it, the lack
of any contractual obligations, and the probability, from a business standpoint, that
financially it would not return as satisfactory
a result as was expected of it. But the organized farmers of Western Canada and the
Canadian Federation of Agriculture wanted
to have a long-term contract to enable them
to look forward to a stable market and a
known income. This point of view prevailed
in the end, despite the judgment of more
experienced people who based their opinion on
the merits of the legislation. Those responsible
for introducing the measure said that they
were doing so because of the demand of the
organized farmers. They said, "We must give
them what they want."
Let us consider whether in Canada today a
dernocratic government is justified in giving
the grain producers what they want, or
whether it should tell them: "You do not
know what is good for you. We refuse to do
what you want, and we shall adopt other
measures which we think will be for the
financial benefit of the whole country." Not
one person inside or outside parliament, apart
from a few members in this chamber, was
willing to assume the responsibility of saying
such a thing.
Should a democratic government respond
to the demands of the public and let the public learn its lessons through bitter experience,
or should it do the things which in its wisdom
and judgment it feels should be done regardless of the demands of organized groups? It
is my opinion that such legislation as this
which has been put on our statute books,
particularly in the past ten years, has largely
been the result of pressure applied on the
government by organized groups; and I do
not belleve any pressure group has been
more successful in obtaining results than
organized agriculture. Labour has had some
success, but certainly the political power of
this country has shifted from what we all
once recognized as the middle class, or business group, to agriculture and labour. Anybody who cares to study this whole issue will
find this to be true.

SENATE
Honourable senators, the bill before us, like
the original Act, is based ostensibly, on an
agreement-the International Wheat agreement-and I do not think there is any
guarantee that this agreement will work out
more successfully than did the British Wheat
agreement. Therefore, I ask, are we in the
second chamber of parliament going to quietly
say that political considerations will be
observed here at the expense of convictions?
It seems to me that this is the real issue
presented to us by this bill, and it is with
this thought in mind that I look back on the
discussion which took place when the original
Wheat Board Bill and the British Wheat
Agreement were before us. Fundamentally
and basically I think these points are worth
considering.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh: Honourable
senators, I do not propose to discuss the
theory, principles or ancient history of
wheat, but I want the members of this
chamber to compare the financial position of
the western farmer before the inception of
the Wheat Board with his position since. I
simply want to point out what has actually
happened. I maintain that the setting up
and functioning of the Wheat Board bas produced good results for our farmers. I have
not belonged to any farmers' organization
since 1921, so it cannot be said of me that
I belong to one of those pressure groups
which have been mentioned here this afternoon. I am a farmer-and not one who has
left farming to take up a law practice or
anything else.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: I am just a plain,
ordinary farmer. So let me say that at no
time in the history of Canada has the
Western farmer been as happy and prosperous
as he is today. That is a pretty good state
of affairs; and I think that one of the reasons
why we are here is to perpetuate legislation
which will keep our farmers in a happy
frame of mind. There is not even one
farmers' organization in my district, and yet
nine out of ten of my neighbours and farmer
friends with whom I have associated for the
last thirty years are, like myself, in favour
of the Wheat Board. They have definitely
told me so, and have passed resolutions to
this effect at their conventions. It is for this
reason that I propose to back this legislation.
On a question of this kind I prefer to accept
the advice of organized or unorganized
farmers rather than that of any person from
Winnipeg, Toronto or Ottawa. Therefore I
am strongly in favour of this bill.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aseliine: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to delay the house, but I have
never missed an opportunity to speak about
legislation of this kind. I would first congratulate
the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) on making a
very fine speech. I enjoyed every word he
spoke, and I really think it was the best
speech he ever made in this chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No person is more capable of discussing wheat problems than is the
honourable gentleman, because for many
years he was president of the Grain Growers
Grain Company and later of the United
Grain Growers Limited. Although he has
not been so active in the marketing of wheat
in the past few years, he is still a farmer.
I do not intend to discuss the British Wheat
agreement, because I have already dealt with
it on two or three occasions. It came to us
as an accomplished fact and we could not do
much about it. We did not like it, for we
were afraid that it would not work out well,
and we said so; but in the end we allowed it
to go through, hoping that it would turn out
to the advantage of the farmer.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) stated that the money which
our farmers lost by virtue of the British
wheat agreement should not be refunded to
them by the Canadian government. I asked
him why not, and he said he would give his
reasons, or that he was coming to that. Perhaps he is like me, in that when I am interrupted and asked a question I say "I am
coming to that," but I seldom do come to it.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I want to make my
position in this matter as clear as I can. I
agree with a great deal of what was said
by my leader (Hon. Mr. Haig), and the
honourable senators from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh).
Coming as I do from a farming district, I am
vitally interested in the growing of wheat.
I wish to inform the house that 80 per cent
of the farmers in the territory where I live,
and I think throughout the whole West,
are in favour of a wheat board of some sort.
The other 20 per cent are opposed to ny
kind of a wheat board, as they wish to be
free to market their grain on the open
market. Of the 80 per cent who are in
favour of a wheat board, 60 per cent would
prefer a board with compulsory powers for the
handling of coarse grains as well as wheat.
The remaining 40 per cent of the 80 per cent
cent would like a wheat board of a voluntary

JUNE 13, 1950
type-that is, one to which they could seil or
flot, as they pleased-and, operating along
with that, an open mnarket. And ail who are
in favour of a wheat board want one that is
non-political and on which farmers are
represented.
They are of opinion that if
the government had flot interfered by making the British wheat agreement the Wheat
Board would neyer have made one of its
own accord. I too arn quite satisfied that
if there had been no agreement, the board
would have sold the wbeat on the open market
and obtained for the farmers much more
money than they received.
That is the
situation as I see it.
I do not think the International Wheat
Agreement has much to do with the question.
At any rate, it runs for only one year at a
tirne, so we shall fot be selling five years
short as we did in the past. However, we may
be selling one year short; and, as my leader
(Hon. Mr. Haig) bas stated, we rnay be
dependent on the open mnarket in the United
States to fix a price for the wheat that we
do seli. I ar n ot going to takp any definite
stand on that, except to say that I arn doubtfui that the International Wbeat Agreement will work out any better than the
British agreement did. The only thing I
can say in favour of the international agreement is that it is to run for only a year
at a time instead of for a longer period.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Before my honourabie
friend sits down, would be indicate the
source of bis definite and specific percentages as to the preferences of farmers?
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: He bas been "Galluping"
around.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I imagine that would
beHon. Mr. Lambert: -an estimate?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: He is "coming to that."
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I get around quite a bit
among farmers' organizations in the community where I live, and these percentages
are based on my own observation. Information of that kind is not obtainable from the
Bureau of Statistics.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Is the bonourable
gentleman speaking as a farmer or as a
lawyer?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As both. I arn satisfied
that tbese percentages are approximateiy
correct; that the average farmer prefers a
wheat board of some kind, but does not want
a political board.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
whiie for some twenty years it has been my
priviiege to listen-nostly in the house of
Commons-to speeches on wheat and its
55950-2

marketing, this is the first time tbat I have
risen to take part in debate on a bill dealing
with the subi ect. There is a very good reason
for that. In tbe House of Commons wben
a bill like the present one is being considered
it is usuai to leave the discussion to members
from the wbeat growing provinces. In fact, s0
strong bas this custom become in that house,
that if a member from other tban one of the
Prairie Provinces ventured to say anytbing,
about a wheat bill, he would be tbought to
have something wrong witb bis bead, However, as I corne from a province that buys
wheat, I make no apology for speaking on
the bill now before us.
The other day I asked tbe leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) if this bill
was intended to apply to the whole ten
provinces, and he said it was. I wonder bow
many honourabie senators bave read the bill
carefully and reahize its full implications. To
my way of thinking this is a case wbere, as
usuaily happens, power is being granted more
power. A similar thing is happening to the
Labour government of Britain, and I doubt
if it can turn back in the direction of hess
power. Generaliy speaking, once a government starts on the road towards depriving
people of their rights, there is no turning back,
and in my vièw this bill provides a striking
proof of that statement. Look at section 8,
bonourable senators. Read it carefuhhy. The
board is given control over flour mîis and
other establishments in every province. Listen
to what the section says:
..it is hereby declared that ail flour mills, feed
mills, feed warehouses and seed cleaning mills,
whether heretofore constructed or hereafter ta be
constructed, are and each of them is hereby declared ta be works or a work for the general
advantage of Canada.

If this bill passes, in one feil swoop every
flour miii, feed warehouse .and grain elevator
in Canada will corne under the control. of the
Wheat Board. I ask you honourable senators,
is that what you want?
It is because I believe the powers given
under this bill wiil bave a bad effect upon
ail the provinces-not merely the wheat growing provinces alone-tbat I rise up in protest. As if it were not enough for the Wheat
Board to bave autbority over ail grain elevators and milis in the country, it is given
besides control. over the importation of grain.
Thus, anybody in British Columbia who may
wish to bring in grain from the United States
or any other country will not be allowed to
do so uniess he flrst gets a permit from the
Wbeat Board, which is situated many miles
from our province. I say, honourable senators, that the powers which it is proposed

SENATE
to give to the board are altogether too sweep'ng, and I am delighted to see this honourable
Senate devoting so much time to the con-ideration of this important measure.
I would remind my honourable friend fron
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) that people who
attend meetings of organizations are often
easily carried away by spellbinders and soapbox orators. I well remember when it was
first proposed to place the control of coarse
grains under the Wheat Board. I was then
a member of the House of Commons, and I
received a communication on behalf of
farmers in my district. They had been told
that they were being robbed, through transactions on the exchange which were describel
as gambling, and that this resulted in their
having to pay excessive prices for oats and
barley. I was notified that if I did not support the placing of coarse grains under
the Wheat Board two thousand members of
their organization would campaign against
me and help to defeat me at the next election.
Like the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), I tried to point out the
path they were following; but they went along
with the Wheat Board. Today the British
Columbia farmers, without the gamble which
they said was the cause of their distress, are
paying 40 per cent more for the coarse grains
than they did before. So I say to my honourable friend from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh)
that I know something about organizations,
and I know that a man with a glib tongue
can lead a group of people up the wrong path.
I sometimes think that is what has happened in many organizations in the Prairie
Provinces.
I say emphatically that I cannot accept the
proposed provisions of this bill.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to let this measure pass without
expressing my views on it. I am not very
enamoured of the compulsory feature of the
Canadian Wheat Board Act; in fact, some
two years ago, when oats and barley were

brought under the provisions of the board, I
stood in my place and voted against the
proposal. Nevertheless, we must examine the
facts and be practical in what we think and
say.
I live among and am very intimate with
the wheat producers of Western Canada, and
I know that they have come to believe, and
I think rightly so, in stability. When the
farmer sows his wheat in the spring he wants
a reasonable guarantee that when his crop is
harvested he will receive a certain price for
it.
The British Wheat Agreement has
brought about such stability. I do not say
that without the wheat agreement the farmer

would not have got more for his grain, but
I know that the stability resulting from the
agreement enabled the farmer to meet and
liquidate his obligations. In my opinion the
farmers of Western Canada are in a better
financial position today than ever before in
history. I do not say that the British Wheat
Agreement deserves all the credit for this,
but it certainly has helped.
To learn how well off the farmers of
Western Canada are today one only has to
inquire of the mortgage companies how many
farms were mortgaged prior to the war and
how many are today free of debt, or to visit
the Land Titles Office and see how many
farmers have clear titles to their properties.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Would the honourable
member permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Yes, of course.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: Does my friend wish to
imply that if it had not been for the British
Wheat Agreement today's prosperous conditions would not prevail? I find it hard to
believe that the agreement is the sole reason.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The farmer knows
when he plants his crop that he is going to
get a certain price when be harvests it, and
he plans accordingly.
The honourable member from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) made the statement that
80 per cent of western farmers were in
favour of the Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In favour of some kind

of board.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I would say that if a
census were taken today amongst the western
farmers-and in my district they are as independent as any other class of people-it
would be found that 90 per cent prefer the
compulsory Wheat Board to trading on the
Grain Exchange.
I am not in favour of compulsory marketing, but the facts speak for themselves. The
farmers, like the labouring classes who are
looking for pensions and medical protection,
want security-in other words, a stable marketing system. Notwithstanding the losses
mentioned by the leader opposite and the
honourable member from Churchill, the
operations of the Wheat Board have made
the farmers more contented and happier. I
say that with all its shortcomings the Wheat
Agreement has been a success.
Coming now to the question of the payment back to the farmers of $450 million or
$500 million-the leader opposite certainly
does not know the right figure, and neither
do I-I may say in the first place that the

JUNE 13, 1950
final payment has not been made, and my
honourable friend can only guess at how
much it is goinig ta be.
Han. Mr. Haig: Well, how much do you
think the last payment will be?
Hcn. Mr. Beaubien: I have no idea.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I prediet that it will not be
more than five cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, I do nlot know,
and I arn sure my friend does nlot.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The report shows it.
Han. Mr. Beaubien: The amount of $450
million ta compensate the farmers for what
they have lostHon. Mr. Lambert: It is $357 million.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I thought my friend
said $450 million
Hon. Mr. Haig: I said $488 million.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Anyway, the farmer
through the wheat pool and the Federation
of Agriculture asked for this contract. Those
were the anly twa arganizatians which made
representatians ta the government ta put the
contract thraugh. But there was no guarantee ta the f armer that, if the wheat was
sold at less than the world price, he would
be campensated for the loss. There was fia
contractual obligation.
Han. Mr. Aselline: Then what does' the
phrase "have regard ta" mean?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Well, what does it
mean?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are talking about price.
Hon. Mr. Aselline:
It means the lasses
would be made up.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: As far as I arn concerned, I would of course be pleased ta accept
a cheque fromi the government for anything
I may have lost through the selling of my
wheat under the British Wheat Agreement;
but there was certainly fia cantractual obligation ta compensate the farmer if he suffered
a loss. The organizations which represented
the farmer were satisfied with the cantract
in the farm in which it was signed, and in
practice it has worked very well.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If we could get away
from the compulsory feature of marketing I
would favour it; but we are living in unusual
times when every other country in the world
is doing considerable buying through government agencies.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend says that he
wants ta get away from the compulsory
Mature. May I ask him what there is ta
55950-321

prevent the board from buying wheat on the
open market ta fill an international agreement?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I do nat know that
there is anything ta prevent that pracedure,
but I say ta my honourable friend that if the
Wheat Board was ta use the option marketHon. Mr. Haig: Not the option market.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If the board wanted ta
buy, it would have ta do so in the option
market on future deliveries.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, fia.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: If that was done, the
wheat growers of western Canada would be
up in arms and protest that they did not want
any transaction carried an in the Grain
Exchange. Mark you, I admit that many
farmers cannot give any reason for their
attitudeHon. Mr. Lambert: Not a satisfactory
reasan.
Han. Mr. Beaubien:-nevertheless that is
the frame of mind of the western Canadian
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me ask another question.
In 1946 and 1947 the board sold about 80
million bushels in the open market. Why can
it nat buy wheat the same way it seils it?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The Wheat Board got
delivery from the farmers because they were
compelled ta deliver it ta the board.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Haw did the board fix the
price at which it sold the grain?
Han. Mr. Beaubien: It sold through the
Grain Exchange ta the variaus countries that
wanted wheat.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, it did not seil any
through the Grain Exchange.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It got its prices from
a grain exchange, either in Chicago or
Minneapolis.
Hon. Mr. Haig:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: And today it is using
the Grain Exchange for transactions in oats
and barley. I repeat, that in practice the
stabilization of wheat prices bas created contented farming cammunities ail over Western
Canada, and alter all, if you have got the
farmers contented you have accomplished
something.
Hon. Arthur Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I shahl take but a few moments ta express
my position.
Like the honourable the senior senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) and the
honourable senator from New Westminster

SENATE
(Hon. Mr. Reid), I speak with some diffidence
on the matter of wheat. Like them, I am not
in the grain business and it is many years
since I took part in the sale of a bushel of
wheat. Nevertheless, I am very much interested. I listened to the speeches made by
honourable senators who do know something
about the wheat business, and I see no reason
to change from the position that I have held
for many years on this type of legislation,
and, since I have been a member of the
Senate, on this particular legislation. What
we see demonstrated by it here and elsewhere, may be said to flow from the philosophy of Karl Marx. When, as a boy, I took
part in the growing and selling of wheat, I
often heard it said "You can buy wheat frorn
the Liverpool Corn Exchange at a lower
price than you can buy it in Winnipeg." The
reason was that a number of skilled business
men ransacked the markets of the world to
buy the best wheat at the lowest price. That
sort of individual enterprise was successful:
it handled the problem of supplying the
United Kingdom more efficiently, in all probability, than it has been handled since.
With the advent of the Socialist government now in power in Great Britain, the
Liverpool Corn Exchange was abolished, and
a government official was appointed to do
all the buying. With many millions of people
depending on his judgment, and with all the
power of the government

behind him, the

acts of individuals conferring behind green
baize doors became international incidents.
As I see the picture, as a result of that action
by the British Government we in Canada
followed suit: we, too, abolished the free
methods of carrying on business and substituted the selling of wheat by government.

In my view, it is as objectionable for a
government to go into the business of selling
as it is for it to go into the business of buying, and I am opposed to this measure not
because I know the details of wheat trading,
but as a matter of principle. While I personally have not grown wheat in recent years,

and while the constituency I represented in
the House of Commons is not engaged in the
production of wheat, the portion of the province that I now represent, as well as the
rural communities of Ontario, are interested
in this measure. If you want an illustration
of why we are interested, observe the demand
which is now being made that the general
body of Canadian taxpayers shall repay to the
farmers of the West a supposed loss of $488
million.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Pay it up!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Pay it up, yes. As a
consequence of this government flyer in

wheat, the general taxpayers are to pay $488
million to the western farmers. If the people
of the city and of the province from which
I come are not concerned when suggestions
of that kind are made, I do not know what
we are interested in. What is involved is
not solely the techniques of growing, buying
and selling wheat, but general business; and
all of us are interested in the general business of Canada. I think I can say fairly
definitely, on behalf of the informed people
in the province and the city from which
I come, that we are opposed to this kind of
legislation. I am, at all events.
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) has said that we have failed
in our duty. I think he is right. He has
also charged that we have allowed political
considerations to take precedence over principles. That is not so in my case. I have
opposed this type of legislation on every
occasion that it has arisen; and I shall oppose
it on this occasion. If there are only two or
three who agree with me that does not matter;
we shall still oppose it.
I propose to vote against this bill.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Before the
question is put, I should like to say a word
or two with respect to the discussion which
has taken place.
At the opening of his remarks, the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
said he regretted the fact that there were so
few in the chamber who have an intimate
knowledge of the grain trade and who would
be able to participate in the discussion; and I
noted a look of utter amazement on the face of
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) that I should venture for a
moment to say a word about a business of
which I have but a very limited knowledge.
To the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who contributed
at great length, but not at too great length,
to a most illuminating discussion, I would
say that theirs is no case of a sudden conversion. Consistently, year in and year out,
they have opposed this type of legislation,
and they could find no merit at all in the
British Wheat Agreement. So with whatever
else I might charge them, I could not accuse
them of inconsistency.
I was particularly interested-and this I
say with no thought of reflecting on the
address of the leader of the opposition-in
the excellent and informative speech of the
honourable senator from Churchill. In the
conflict of opinions expressed on both sides
of the house, it presents the views of those'

JUNE 13, 1950
who are convinced that the interests of agriculture would be better served by a reversion
to the business era which preceded 1929, and
which was characterized by entire absence of
control or regulation or support of the marketing system: the days of what is popularly
referred to as the "boom or bust" policy, the
times of $3 wheat or 30-cent wheat, as fortune
might dictate. I suppose, if we were living
in a world of free trade such as is envisaged
in the resolution introduced by the honourable member from Kitchener (Hon. Mr.
Euler), there might be such a reversion; but
I am convinced that no Canadian government
will ever again throiv agriculture to the
wolves of uncertainty and wide fluctuations.
The tragic circumstances which followed the
adoption of the type of policy advocated this
afternoon are so vivid in the memories of
Westerners that something different has got
to be done.
I am not prepared to say whether the
British Wheat Agreement or certain regulations which were put into effect to control
prices in this country were the essence of wisdom, but I do not think anybody will deny
that the economie affairs of Canada during
the last World War and immediately thereafter were better handled than they were during the corresponding period in relation to
the first World War. And if there should be
another war-God forbid it-I would hope
that the progress of knowledge of the
Canadian people would enable them to handle
their affairs at that time even better than we
have handled ours. In any event, I am convinced that no future government will ever
put agriculture out on the limb again and
place the farmers in the position in which
they found themselves in the 1930's.
My honourable friend is constantly advocating the lifting of all restrictions on wheat, but
I have never heard him clamouring for the
removal of tariff protection from this country's
secondary industries, so as to leave them to
the mercy of open competition. My honourable friends must be fair. They cannot have
full protection for their particular interests
and argue that agriculture must be exposed
to a sort of simon-pure Liberalism, and subjected to the whims and chances of uncontrolled private enterprise, no matter how
bitter the consequences. No future government will consent to this. It may be that
improvements can be applied to the present
method of maintaining a fair market price and
keep a floor under it, not only as regards the
immediate future but in the event of uncertainties yet to be encountered. But I believe
that neither this nor any other government
faced with similar conditions, will leave the

basic industries of this country open to fluctuations, no matter how much some of our
friends make obeisance to the god of private
enterprise, particularly while the industries
which supply our farmers with goods enjoy a
sort of protection to keep their prices up.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
from Churchill knows that, and indeed my
earliest recollection is that his was one of the
most eloquent voices I ever heard expounding
the theory that we should not protect some
industries to the detriment of others.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I believe the honourable
leader is under a misapprehension. I do not
object to the Wheat Board, but I object to
the compulsory features involved in the carrying out of the International Wheat Agreement.
I do not like a number of persons arbitrarily
and coercively saying to me that I must do
thus and so when it is not necessary in the
carrying out of the agreement.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is a pertinent
statement which I am not in a position to
answer. My point is that I would be departing
from my traditional Liberalism if I were to
support anything that would protect one
industry to the detriment of another. Let me
repeat: No matter what government may come
into power, it will not act differently. As a
matter of fact we now have a peacetime regulation-the Agricultural Prices Support Act
-which contemplates that prices of agricultural products will not fall below a certain
level, and the government is committeed to
this undertaking. That statute cannot be made
workable unless in some, way or other a
relationship in maintained between prices and
the total quantity of commodities produced.
So unless we are prepared to remove every
obstacle to the free flow of trade and to allow
agriculture to take its chances in open competition with the secondary industries, there
will have to be some form of regulation or
control.
I was interested in the most ingenious argument of the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) that the wheat producers have
suffered a heavy loss. My honourable friend
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and another
honourable gentleman seemed to be willing
to accept this premise. In the historical outline that my honourable friend from Churchill
gave us this afternoon he mentioned that when
price controls were first established, in 1941,
wheat was exempted out of consideration for
the producers who had been forced ta sell at
disastrously low prices in the thirties. He
said that control was not placed on the price
of wheat until it had risen to I think $1.23,
which was considered to approximate parity

SENATE

with other commodity prices that were frozen
at the time. In the intervening period varying
prices have been received by the producers
from their sales on the domestie market and
for export; and, looked at in the light of the
prices fixed for other products, the net return
from wheat would seem to have been a pretty
fair one. If I am wrong in this assumption, I
cannot understand how it happens that our
agricultural economy is in such excellent
shape, as everyone admits. My honourable
friend opposite (Hon Mr. Haig) says that he
does business with farmers in Manitoba. I do
not suppose he has ever known the agricultural economy in his province to be on a
sounder basis than it is at the present time.
I think that is a fair statement to make. The
apparent advantages arising from a wheat
price of $3 or $3.50 might for a while have
brought about a boom in which prices in
general would pyramid and there would seem
to be great prosperity; but, as my honourable
friend knows better than I do, the uncontrolled
market had in it seeds of economic collapse
which virtually ruined the economy of the
West.
Whatever the price that was fixed, whether
by direct control or in consequence of the
British Wheat Agreement, the prosperity that
the West has enjoyed would indicate that
the price must have been fairly reasonable
in relation to the cost of production. My
friend contends that the farmers could have
obtained $488 million more than they did.
This is the extra amount that he estimates
they would have received if there had been
no British Wheat Agreement, or other form
of price control, and if for the portion of
their wheat that was sold under the agreement they had been able to realize, not the
top-notch Argentine price, but a price higher
than was obtained under the agreement,
and if Canada and the United States had continued to provide money to enable purchasers
to pay the higher price, and if legislation
had been passed to exempt farmers from
taxation on the $488 million. And be now
says that parliament should vote $488 million
to be paid to the farmers over a period
of years.

the wheat sold to Canadian consumers his
estimate of the amount lost by the farmers
would have ta be increased.
Here is another reason why I cannot
understand my honourable friend's argument.
Wheat was not the only product subjected te
price contral when sold either for domestic
consumption or for export. Take steel, for
instance. Suppose steel producers were to
base a claim for compensation on the extra
amount they could have obtained during the
war period if there hai been no price coatrol
on their domestic and export business, ani if
they had been exempted from the payment of
excess profits taxes. I venture to say that
their claim, though perhaps it might not run
to $488 million, would at least be in the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The same could be said
about lumber.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes. The lumber
industry also was controlled as te its donestie
and export business.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my honourable friend again? Did we refuse to sell all
the wheat that was needed for the production of flour and bread in Canada? No, we
met the full demand.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I suppose the lumber
dealers met the full demand in Canada too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, they did not.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is not an important point. The truth is that for the benefit
of the people as a whole the price of everything produced in Canada was controlled to
some degree. All producers could, if they
wish, build up a hypothetical bill against the
government for the additional money they
would have received had no controls been
exercised.
I would point out to my honourable friend
that the higher prices which he claims the
farmers could have got on a free market would
have been conditional upon the ability of
purchasers abroad to pay. It is one thing
to sell goods to foreign purchasers and another
thing te get paid for those goods. I suppose
that every bushel of wheat that has been sold
abroad by this country in recent years has

JUNE 13, 1950

from the farmer's point of view, the inestimable advantage of any such agreement is that
it creates a floor under which the wheat price
cannot fall.
And let me here remind wheat producers
of the West that not all primary industries
are in as favourable a position as theirs. By
way of illustration I will mention two of the
major products which my province of Nova
Scotia has been accustomed to supply to the
United Kingdom market, apples and lumber.
It is fortunate for the economy of Canada that
at the moment Britain is willing to buy our
wheat and the Americans are willing to
finance the purchase. Make no mistake about
that. Britain does not want our apples just
now, and a long-established trade that we
have enjoyed with the United Kingdom is in
consequence gone. And Nova Scotia's British
lumber trade, which existed long before anybody knew that wheat could be grown north
of the forty-ninth parallel, has shrunk to
relatively small proportions. It has not
entirely disappeared, although a few weeks
ago most lumbermen in the province fearei
that it had. And the United Kingdom demand
for pit-props has ceased entirely.
Well,
honourable senators, wheat producers have
not been up against anything like that. Partly
I take it, because the English are able to buy
wheat here cheaper than anywhere else, and
partly because the Americans are willing to
finance the business, our sale of wheat has
continued without interruption. And apparently it is going to continue indefinitely.
I have great admiration for our Prairie
Provinces, and I am desirous of doing my part
to see that they are never again faced with
the terrible conditions which the muchpraised free market brought about. I seriously
doubt if anyone could show that the British
Wheat Agreement, and the stabilized market
that Canada continues to hold, have not
directly and indirectly resulted in very great
advantages to the economy of this country. I
need hardly say to my honourable friend that
when the price of wheat goes to $3.00 or $3.50

a bushel the inevitable consequence will be
that the buyers will start growing the product
themselves or looking for another source of
supply. Though I am not prepared to say
that the British Wheat Agreement is in every
respect the perfect answer to the marketing
problem, it is infinitely better than the alternative of an unstable market, and it promises
to be still better in the future.
Many of my honourable friends know much
more about the question of wheat marketing
than I do, but it is my belief that the system
of controlled prices during and after the war
has served Canada well. Certainly she is a
great deal more prosperous today than she
was in the aftermath of the earlier war when
there was no price control.

RED RIVER FLOODS
RELIEF CONTRIBUTION FROM NORMANDY

Hon. Thomas Vien:

Honourable senators,

the great catastrophe that has befallen citizens
of Winnipeg and of a large part of Manitoba
has aroused deep sympathy not only in
Canada but outside as well.
During the war and the post-war period,
in my capacity of National Executive ViceChairman of the Canadian United Allied
Relief Fund, I had occasion to send relief
goods of all kinds to France, Belgium, Holland,
Greece and elsewhere; and some to Normandy
which had been extensively devastated by
the military operations during the invasion,
the occupation and the liberation.
I have received from the Marquis of
Clermont-Tonnerre, Director of the French Red
Cross Society, District of Calvados, Normandy,

My dear Marquis,
I was deeply moved by your letter of the 2nd
instant, which expressed in so touching a manner
your sympathy on the occasion of the catastrophe
which has befallen our city of Winnipeg and its

environs.

We are most grateful for the concern you are so
kindly taking in this disaster, which affects our
people in Manitoba and has caused material havoc
.
ta the extent of nearly $100,000
I will deem it an agreeable duty ta convey your

generous contribution to the Prime Minister of
Manitoba and to the Mayor of Winnipeg. This
token of sympathy from the beautiful Province
of Normandy, which has itself been so severely tried
by the war, goes to our hearts. We appreciate the
high value of the gesture, knowing that the offerings of the donors come not from their own abundance but rather from their actual want, ta relieve
the distress of their Canadian brothers. We prize
much more the quality than the amount of such a
donation, for we know it is heartfelt.
I thank you most sincerely, and pray you to
express our profound gratitude to all those who
have so generously responded to your appeal on
behalf of our Canadian sufferers.

JUNE 14, 1950
Please accept, my dear Marquis, the assurance of
my high consideration. and the expression of my
kindest regards.
Thomas Vien, Senator
President,
Canada-France Committee of Montreal
Honourable senators, this is eviden- - of
the deep grati.ude towards Canada of the
peoples that we have aided, and of that
human brotherhood which exists between
the nations of the western and democratic
world, and which is growing stronger every
day.
I hope I have adequately and properly
expressed the feeling of honourable senators
in my reply to the Marquis de ClermontTonnerre.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: As a senator from Manitoba, I want to thank our distinguished colleague from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) for
the sentiments of appreciation he has expressed

to the people of Normandy for their fine
gesture of sympathy for the people of
Manitoba. On behalf of our people, and
especially those of the Red River Valley, I
can assure my honourable friend that we are
extremely grateful for this contribution. I
can say quite candidly that all contributions
are sorely needed. The tokens of sympathy
which have been extended to us from peoples
everywhere have made the people of Manitoba realize what a small place the world
really is.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
DEFENCE SERVICES PENSION BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 134, an Act to amend the Militia
Pension Act and change the title thereof.
He said:
Honourable senators, before
explaining the amendments contained in this
bill, may I first give a brief outline of the
Militia Pension Act, which it is proposed to
amend? In effect, the object of the bill is to
widen and make more liberal the provisions
under which the men in the active services
may qualify for pension or retirement allowances.
The Militia Pension Act, like Topsy, has
just grown up over the years, and now consists of five parts. The first part, which was
enacted in 1901, applied only to those who
served in the army. In 1928 Parts II and III
were added for the purpose of including
those who served in the Royal Canadian Navy
and the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1937
Part IV was added, and this provided that
pensions paid under Parts I, II and III

should be paid on a monthly basis. Part V
of the Act was added in 1945, when a committee of the House of Commons, upon the
advice of Mr. G. D. Finlayson, recommended
that, for pension purposes, principles similar
to those which apply to civil servants under
the Civil Service Superannuation Act be
made applicable to members of the armed
forces.
The first amendment proposed by the bill
would change the title of the Militia Pension
Act to the Defence Services Pension Act.
Under sections 4 to 12 of the bill all officers
pensioned under Parts I to IV, and who are
employed in the public service of Canada,
are to be dealt with in the same manner, in
so far as remuneration and so on is concerned, as.are those who come under the
Civil Service Act. Under the Act, officers
and warrant officers contribute 5 per cent of
their pay to the pension fund, and provision
is made for their widows and dependents.
However, no contribution is made by those
below the rank of warrant officer, so when
they pass on their widows and dependents
are not taken care of.
I believe that the scale of pensions for our
armed forces is more liberal than that of any
other nation. The following figures will give
a few illustrations of the pay and of the
pensions payable to married men with thirtyfive years of service:
Pay

3,468.00
Major ......................
5,232.00

Pension
$1,772.40
2,427.60
3,662.40

I will now deal briefly with some of the
other amendments. Contributors under Parts
I-IV of the Act who wished to become contributors under Part V were required to
make application before March 31, 1948. In
the process of reorganization of the forces
after the war a number of members of the
forces were in some way or other not given
a proper opportunity to elect to corne under
Part V. Section 9 of the bill, therefore,
extends to December 31 of this year the
period within which anyone may elect to
become a contributor under that Part.
The present section 45 of the Act provides
that a serviceman may, within one year after
he has become a contributor, elect to contribute for the whole or any part of his prior
service. This section is repealed, and the
new section 45 extends the time within which
a serviceman may elect to count prior noncontributory service to six months after the
coming into force of the amendment.
Pensions were formerly applied for and
granted on the authority of the government
and the recommendation of the Treasury

SENATE

Board. Section 50 of the bill sets up a
Service Pension Board, with power to grant
pensions.
There are certain other minor changes, and
corrections of anomalies, to which I need not
refer.
Finally, I may point out that the government intends to introduce within two or three
years a completely new Defence Services
Pension Act in a consolidated and, it is hoped,
simpler form than the present statute.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: What is the wish of
the house? Is it the desire to have the bill
sent to committee?
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If it meets with the
wishes of the house, I move the third reading
now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. F. W.

Gershaw

moved

the second

reading of Bill 209, an Act to amend the
Prairie Farm Assistance Act, 1939.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish to
thank the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) for asking me to move the second
reading of this bill and explain the few
amendments it contains.
Prairie farm assistance, commonly known
as the dry bonus, has been in operation since
1939. In general the scheme provides that
where there is a crop failure and the yield
is less than four bushels per acre, a farmer
may secure a bonus of $2.50 an acre, up to
a certain acreage. If the yield is from four
to eight bushels an acre, the bonus is $1.50.
That scheme has proved rather costly. A
bonus bas been paid in ten of the eleven
years since the Act has been in force. Contributions are made by farmers at the rate
of 1 per cent of the value of all grain
marketed, and these have brought in a total
amount of about $45 million. Bonuses paid
out total about $124 million, the difference
having come from the treasury.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Can the honourable gentleman tell me how much was contributed by
and paid out to farmers of each of the three
Prairie Provinces?

Hon.

Mr.

Gershaw: Manitoba

has

paid

about $71 million and received about $22
million; Saskatchewan bas paid about $24ý
million and received about $94 million;
Alberta has paid about $13 million and
received about $26 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thought that Manitoba had
paid more than its share.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: During the early years
of this century homesteaders crowded on to
the free range land that the federal government opened up for settlement. I can remember seeing long lines of men standing in front
of the land office, all day and all night, awaiting their turn to file on land. In 1915 and 1916
the crops were good; but in general, partly
because of poor prices but chiefiy as a result
of drought, the settlers suffered great hardship, and indeed often were on the verge of
starvation. In some years almost every small
town had its own relief office, to which farmers
applied for food or seed or fodder for their
cattle.
Gradually it came to be felt that these
people should be encouraged to put in crops
and to help themselves as much as possible,
and in 1939, with this end in view, the Prairie
Farm Assistance Act was passed. The only
people who received assistance under the Act
were those whose principal occupation was
farming and who lived on the land or close
to it from May to November of each year. No
payments could be made out to land companies
or speculators.
The first amendment adds a paragraph (c) to
subsection 3 of section 3 of the Act. Paragraph (a) provides that the bonus shall be
paid only on half the cultivated acreage, and
(b) limits the acreage on which bonus may be
paid to not more than 200 acres. The new
paragraph (c) narrows the application of the
Act to the extent that the bonus shall not be
paid on certain lands leased from the
government.
In ten of the eleven years in which the
Act has been in force the bonus has been paid;
eighty-five townships have qualified for the
bonus in each of the ten years, and some 339
townships have qualified in nine out of the
ten years. The bill proposes to exempt
certain lands from these benefits.
Other benefits have been extended to the
farmers in dry areas. For instance, some 1,400
persons have been assisted to move to a more
productive area. Under the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act, 44,000 reservoirs for irrigation and the watering of stock have been
constructed. It may have nothing to do with
this amendment, but I should perhaps say that
1,750,000 acres of dry land have been taken
out of cultivation to be used as community
pastures.

JUNE 14, 1950
To sum up: The first amendment provides
that if certain government lands were so poor
that they were not taken up before December
31, 1940, they would not now be eligible for
the bonus if a crop was scratched in.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Before the honourable
senator leaves the first amendment, may I ask
him if the ineligible farmers are obliged to
pay the 1 per cent when they market their
grain, with no hope of benefiting from it?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: That is quite true. Like
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), who perhaps will never benefit
under this Act, the farmers in the area to
which I refer pay a levy of 1 per cent on all
their marketed grain. While it may be considered unfair, it must be remembered that the
levy, which covers only about one-third of the
cost of the administration of the Act, is made
on persons engaged in the industry and is paid
back to the industry. There are a few exceptions by which some lands leased from a
government may qualify for the bonus.
Government-owned lands which are under
the Soldiers' Settlement and Veterans' Land
Act are not affected by this amendment. In
each district there is a Veterans' Land Act
board which is very careful to see that dry
lands are not sold to veterans. It does, however, happen occasionally that some returned
man wants to settle near his childhood home,
or for some other reason acquires a piece
of dry land. In those circumstances he is
entitled to the benefit of the bonus, if the
board has approved his purchase of this land.
In the province of Alberta the government
mapped out certain special areas, where the
farmers have received a cultivation lease and
a grazing lease. These areas are entitled to
the bonus.
In the province of Saskatchewan certain
land has only become available since December 31, 1940. For instance, the Matador
ranch has been taken over by a co-operative
organization, and that land is still under the
bonus. Some lands which were set aside for
school purposes were not sold before 1940,
and the purchaser of those lands will be
entitled to the bonus if his crop fails. Under
the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act community pastures were established. In order
to accomplish this, some of the settlers were
moved from the dry area to irrigated or
cleared land. These people still come under
the benefits of the Act.
The Minister has said that the amendment
which excludes certain land not taken up
prior to 1940 is more or less an experiment,
and that if it works any hardships the legislation may be reviewed at the next session
and, if necessary, revised.

The second amendment in the bill does
away with the requirement that, in order to
benefit by the bonus, areas not in an eligible
township must be of rectangular shape. When
the Act was first passed it confined the benefits strictly within township Unes. In the
yield in a township was below eight bushels
per acre the township became eligible for
the bonus, but if the average yield was above
that figure the township was ineligible. This
arrangement led to a good deal of trouble
for one farmer would become eligible for the
bonus, and his neighbour across the road,
but in another township, might be ineligible.
Unfortunately, the rain did not stop or start
on township lines.
The Act was later amended to provide
that rectangular areas adjoining a dry township were entitled to the benefits. Section 2
of the bill removes that limitation, and provides that an area adjoining a dry township
need not be rectangular in shape to benefit
by the bonus. This amendment entitles the
man with a poor crop to get the bonus, whether he is in an eligible township or not,
provided that he is in a block of more than
six sections contiguous to an eligible township.
The amendment under section 3 of the bill
proposes to exempt from the 1 per cent levy
certain mills, or feed dealers, who during
the war manufactured flour. As they do not
now manufacture flour, and are only feed
dealers, they should not be required to make
the 1 per cent deduction.
To sum up, honourable senators, the first
amendment in the bill removes certain leased
lands from the benefits of the Act; the
second removes the limitation that dry lands
adjoining an eligible township must be of
rectangular shape; and the third relieves the
feed dealer from the responsibility of deducting the 1 per cent levy.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the honourable senator another question? Although I
do not come from Manitoba, I am interested
in the situation in that province. This year
many areas which were flooded will not be
put in crop. Will those who farm that land,
but will not get any crop, be eligible for
awards under the provisions of this bill?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: That question bas come
up, but no decision has been reached. The
bonus is paid for loss from drought, and
destruction by hail and frost, and almost any
other cause which reduces the yield. But
the direct effect of the flood to which the
honourable senator has referred is something
new, and, as I have said, the question has
yet to be decided.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Before the bill is read
the second time I want to make a very few

SENATE

remarks with respect to it. In my opinion
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act has been
of great value to farmers in dried-out areas.
Though personally I have never received any
part of the bonuses mentioned by my honourable friend, other farmers in the district from
which I come have had considerable sums
of money from this source, and, when the
crops were poor, for several years in succession.
I have previously mentioned the chief
objection I had to the Prairie Farm Assistance
Act. A farmer who lived in one of these
rectangular areas and harvested forty bushels
to the acre might receive a bonus on two
hundred acres; that is, just as much money
as some farmer a mile or two away who had
no crop at all. In some of our districts there
are great variations of yield. For example,
on a few sections of heavy Regina clay a
good crop is assured practically every year;
but a mile or two away you may run into
sand or some type of light land where crop
failures are frequent. But the man on the
good land will collect as much as the man
on the light land. Of course, the farmer who
has a good crop pays income tax on the money
he receives; but the existing situation is not
satisfactory. To a certain extent that condition is remedied by section 2 of this bill. I
think that is quite an improvement.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
rise to congratulate the honourable senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) upon
the fine job he made of explaining the amendments, and to say to the honourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), who put a
question about payments to provinces, that
the answer only emphasizes what I have
already pointed out,-the great importance
of Saskatchewan. It will be noticed that, in
spite of crop failures in many parts of that
province, no less than $24 million was paid
into the fund by our farmers. That amount
is five times as large as Manitoba's contribution.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And what did Saskatchewan
farmers get out of it?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Also it is almost five

times what Alberta paid. I admit that we
received a larger share than they did; but
the figures indicate the pre-eminence of
Saskatchewan in agriculture. It is our wish
and hope that the time will come when the
proceeds of the 1 per cent paid in will equal
the amount which is necessarily paid out.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

PRIME

MINISTER'S

RESIDENCE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the

second reading of Bill 266, an Act to Provide
for the Operation and Maintenance of a
Residence for the Prime Minister of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
provides for the maintenance and operation
of a residence for the Prime Minister. Before the bill was drafted, the government
examined methods by which the residence
of the Prime Minister in England and the
White House in the United States were
The Prime Minister of Great
financed.
Britain is supplied with two residences, one
at No. 10 Downing street, the other at
Chequers. Both of these are wholly maintained by the government. In the United
States the government maintains the White
House and supplies a skeleton staff. The
President pays for the remainder of the staff
and provides for the running expenses of
the house. He is given a sum of $75,000
annually, against which he can draw for
these expenses.
In the case of Canada the circumstances
were modified by the insistence of the Prime
Minister that he should not be any better
off as a result of occupying this proposed
residence, and his determination to make
This bill would provide
some payment.
that the government shall pay the full cost
of maintenance of the residence, but that
the Prime Minister shall pay $5,000 per
annum for food and lodging for himself and
his family.
By section 3 of the bill, the Department
of Public Works will be responsible for the
repairs and heating of the residence, and
the Federal District Commission will maintain the grounds, and under section 4, the
Governor in Council is empowered to appoint,
maintain and fix the remuneration of the
staff to be employed for the management
of the residence. The steward or housekeeper may engage casual help on the advice

JUNE 14, 1950
of the Prime Minister, and the Prime
Minister's chauffeur can be provided with
free lodging. Section 5 provides for the
annual payment of $5,000 by the Prime
Minister. Section 6 provides for payment
of the staff of the residence, for the purchase
of food, for cleaning, laundering, and for
official entertainment.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
my stand in relation to this bill is materially
different from any that has been taken in
the other place. I think a serious mistake
has been made. I fully concur with the
idea that the Prime Minister should have
an official residence. I wholly agree that
the people of Canada should buy it and
pay for it. I am quite willing that the people
of Canada should maintain it, and that the
Prime Minister, during his occupancy, should
not be charged anything for it; but I cannot
understand why we should turn this residence
into a castle and make it a place of entertainment for visiting diplomats and other
people.
It is my opinion that the Prime Minister
has the most difficult job in the country.
Much depends on his leadership, and he has
a tremendous responsibility to meet not only
when parliament is in session but when
directing his cabinet the year round; he also
has to do a certain amount of public speaking.
I sometimes feel that the present Prime
Minister is trying to do too much. But that
is his own business.
I think Canada should have asked the
Prime Minister and his wife to indicate to
appropriate officials the type of residence
they would have liked as a home; and
whether it had cost $50,000 or $100,000 it
would have been all right with Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, but it might not have
suited the next Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it would have. I do
not imagine a castle-like home will ever suit
any Prime MinisterHon. Mr. Euler: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -as long as he has the
interests of his country at heart. There are
recognized places for entertaining people;
we have fine hotels and splendid country
clubs-and do not forget that Canada has
been able to get along quite well for eightythree years without an official residence for
its Prime Ministers. We have had our Macdonald and Laurier, our Borden and our
King-all distinguished Prime Ministers-and
they never had an official residence. I hold
that under our system of government it is
not necessary for our Prime Ministers to
have a residence in which they may receive
distinguished guests from at home and abroad.

I never will be Prime Minister; but if I
were, I would want a place where I could
get away from all the turmoil of public
affairs, and I would want my wife to have a
peaceful spot in which she could escape the
constant glare of publicity. I realize that no
Prime Minister can hold his job unless he
mixes with the people to a certain extent,
but I am old enough to know what my wife
and I both like. We would want a place
where we could get away from public affairs.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: A place to call home.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. Even though this old
structure is now in the process of being
remodelled, the Prime Minister has seen fit
to buy a quiet place somewhere in the country. I cannot understand why the government-quite apart from the Prime Minister
-- ever agreed to this stipulation of $5,000 a
year.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Under our system of taxation it means that $8,000 or $9,000 will be paid
annually for this accommodation. This may
prove useful in bringing home to the Prime
Minister the fact that we have heavy
taxation; but really, honourable senators, we
should not ask him to pay $5,000 a year for
his official residence. He already has to pay
income tax on $21,000 of the $23,000 yearly
income that this country pays him, and I
think his services are worth more than that.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps the members of
the House of Commons cannot say these
things for fear they might be open to criticism from their own constituents; but this
is one place where a person can speak
frankly and openly. I make the prophecy
that within three or four years the Parliament
of Canada will come to the conclusion that
my statement is correct, and that the Prime
Minister should not have to pay $5,000 a
year for his official residence. I am sure
this prophecy will come true, and that the
people of Canada will say: "It does not matter
what the conditions, the Prime Minister is
worth his hire."
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) chooses
to refer to me as a lawyer. Well, I am a
lawyer, and just an ordinary one at that.
But I am also a businessman, and as such I
want to say that if I owned this country and
wanted to hire a man to run it I would not
dare to pay him less than $100,000 a year.
And I would be getting him cheap at that.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: As one whose country
has been exceedingly good to him, and who
has enjoyed a happy and successful life in
the raising of a family and so on, I do not
believe I can look the Prime Minister straight
in the eye and say to him, "We are paying
you $23,000 a year, and you have got to pay
for your keep". That is not a good thing at
all, and I want to say so most emphatically.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
since last year I have apparently gained some
support in opposing the establishment of an
official residence where the Prime Minister
may undertake large-scale entertaining. My
quarrel is with the method that the government adopted in going about this business,
because it led the Prime Minister to the
position where he insisted upon paying this
annual boarding-house keep of $5,000. This
property, which had been serving the
Australian High Commissioner quite handsomely, was purchased by the government at
a cost of $140,000, and estimates as to the cost
of repairs to the building itself vary anywhere
from $150,000 to $250,000. This means that
when the residence is finally remodelled the
total cost may be as much as $500,000. What
will the people of Canada think about this?
I want to repeat what I said in this chamber
on one previous occasion. It is not the duty
of the Prime Minister and his wife to entertain the public in their home. I agree with
what the honourable leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has said on that point. The White
House is the only official residence of the
United States where diplomatic people visiting that country may be entertained, but in
Canada we have the residence of the Governor
General for that purpose. Here we are
spending thousands of dollars for an official
residence for our Prime Minister, but what
will happen to the staff-the cooks and butlers
and so on-when the Prime Minister and his
family go to their summer home? Will the
members of the staff just stay on and cook

place is entirely out of line. It is a monstrous
business and represents one of the greatest
pieces of bungling of which any government
of Canada has ever been guilty. It will be
proclaimed all across the country that, in this
time of housing shortage, an Ottawa house
which was providing necessary accommodation is being converted into a home for the
Prime Minister, and at a total cost which no
one seems able to estimate closely. It may
be anywhere from $200,000 to $500,000. As
I understand it, no tenders were called for,
nor is there a contract for a specified amount.

The work is probably being done on a costplus arrangement, and we know what that
means.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The total cost will be
$500,000.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It will be $500,000, and
perhaps more. But for $40,000 we could have
built a residence that would have been
entirely suitable. How many people will be
required to staff this palace? Let me say
again that what has been done so far towards
providing a home for the Prime Minister is
the greatest piece of bungling I ever heard of.
Certainly, after a fiasco like this, the federal
government has no right to suggest economies
to any provincial government.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
with most of the remarks made about this
bill I personally am in accord, as I think
most senators are. I am one of those who
think that we are far too close to the event
to form a proper judgment on its historical
significance.
Many are withholding their
criticism, so as not to embarrass the present
Prime Minister. I know of nothing that
would be more likely to embarrass the Prime
Minister than criticism of this bill, with its
clause requiring him to pay $5,000 yearly for
food and lodging for himself and family.
That is one of the cheapest things I have ever
seen in any bill, and it causes me to hang my
bead in shame.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why not have the clause
taken out?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Just a minute; I had that
in mind. I do not know whether it would
be in order for me to move that the clause be
deleted.
I agree that there has been bungling in
this matter. In the other chamber it was
explained that the reason for not building a
new residence was that the Edwards house,
which is being remodelled, was too large and
too valuable to be torn down. Well, during
the twenty sessions that I have spent in
Ottawa I have witnessed the demolition of
more valuable properties than this. I remember, for example, that a large building which
would have lasted for another one hundred
years and was worth more than the Edwards
property, was destroyed to make way for the
Confederation Square.
As I say, we are too close to the event to
get a good perspective. In considering the
bill, many of us are thinking of the present
Prime Minister; but we should look at it in
the light of the fact that the residence is
being provided for all future Prime Ministers
as well.

JUNE 14, 1950
It has been openly stated that the Edwards
house, when renovated, will cost $500,000.
As I see it, the income tax may provide one
reason for the requirement, in section 5 of
the bill, that the Prime Minister shall pay
$5,000 yearly for food and lodging. If he
had to include in. his income return the full
annual value of the lod-ging provided him
in that house, he would have nothing left
out of his sessional indemnity and official
salary. Though it may not be in order for
me to move for the deletion of section 5, I
will at least suggest that the bill be referred
to a committee where we can discuss the
whole matter thoroughly. Members of the
House of Commons felt, as I do, that criticism
of the bill would be highly embarrassing to
the Prime Minister. But, after all, we are
providing a home for Canada's Prime Ministers for a long time to come, and I for one
should like to be able to feel sure that we are
doing the right thing.
I realize that we in the Senate cannot raise
the Prime Minister's salary, but at least we
can call attention to its inadequacy. We
seem to be very niggardly indeed in, our
treatment of the head of our country. He is
the chief officer of a corporation doing an
annual business of $2J billion; yet he is paid
only about half as much as is the Governor
of the Bank of Canada, or about one-third
what we give to the President of the Canadian
National Railways.
The Prime Minister of this great country
should have an official residence in keeping
with his position, and nòt a place such as the
old Edwards home. It has been stated that
this house has an historical interest. Well,
for people in Ottawa it may have; but no one
outside of this city ever heard of it. I challenge honourable senators to tell me of anyone in the east or west of Canada, for
instance, to whom the Edwards home means
anything at all.
I should like to see inserted in the bill a
clause giving a name to the residence. The
White House, No. 10 Downing street and
Chequers are names known all over the
world. It will take a long time before the
one we choose for our Prime Minister's
residence becomes as widely familiar as any
of these, and we should not postpone our
choice indefinitely. I do not propose to suggest a name, for I know how much controversy would be aroused if I did.
I agree that a modern and suitable home
could have been built for the Prime Minister at a cost of not more than $75,000. What
we are providing is an establishment appropriate for a millionaire, and some of our

Prime Ministers may not have the financial
means to enable them to keep up the style
expected there.
I consider that the provision for payment
of $5,000 yearly by the Prime Minister for
food and lodging cheapens the whole bill, and
I am going to protest against it as strongly
as I can. I sincerely regret it if my criticism will cause any embarrassment to the
Prime Minister, for whom I have great respect, realizing as I do that although we pay
him a mere pittance he has renounced a
large profesional income in order to carry on
in his high office in response to the wishes of
the people. I certainly hope that the bill
will be referred to committee, in order that
we may amend it and place on the statute
books an Act of which we can feel justly
proud.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, in
some respects this bill is a difficult one to deal
with, for it touches matters that even to a
Prime Minister are of more or less personal
concern. I warmly support the proposal
that the Prime Minister of this country, whoever he may be, should have an official residence. Whether good judgment has been
used in the selection and renovation of the
building referred to in this bill, is a matter
of opinion.

It is certainly not a matter in

which the Prime Minister himself should be
in any way involved, for the man who holds
that office is not only the leader of his party,
but in a peculiar sense is much more than
that-he is the leader of his country.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The provision of an official residence for the leader of our country
is only the meed of respect due him, and an
evidence of public recognition of the financial
obligations always associated with his high
office. If I were to offer criticism of this bill,
it would be as to the manner in which the
whole thing is being proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Section 3 of the bill places
the duty of looking after the furnishing,
maintenance and the heating of the residence
upon the Minister of Public Works.
I do not know that a great deal of exception can be taken to that.
I very much fear, however, that the
provisions of section 4 of the bill may in
the future lead to embarrassment and possibly
unpleasantness. It may be that in our political
battles in this country we are becoming a
little more understanding, shall I say a little
more civilized, than we have been in the
past.

WAR VETERANS' ALLOWANCE BILL
THIRD RIEADING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
third reading of Bill 180, an Act t'o amend
the War Veterans' Allowance Act, 1946.
Han. W. M. Aseltine: 1 had intended to
make a f ew remarks on this bill yesterday,
when the report of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce was presented;
but I did not hear the motion for adoption
0f the report, and before I knew it the
report had been adopted. So I am obliged
to, make my remarks now.
When this bill was before the standing
committee, I made a more or less strenuous
objection to the decentralization proposais
provided for in part V, and it is in connection with those proposais that I wish to
speak today.
Part V is entirely new. The first clause,
subsection (1) of section 31, is as follows:
The Minister may establish regional districts of
the Department and, wlth the approval of the
Governor in Couneil. for each district establlsh a
District Authority consisting of such number of
persorns employed in the department as the Minister
niay prescribe.

Before dealing with that clause 1 should
like to make a few statements with regard
to the whole matter of veterans' allowance.

In 1930, by the War Veterans' Allowance
Act passed in that year, provision was made
for the setting Up of a board empowered to
make ailowances to what are generally
known as "burnt-out veterans"-people who
had served in an actual theatre of war and
who from one cause or another, bad health,
or pensions that were not large enough-were
unable to provide for themselves. That board
was composed of five commissioners, and
during the twenty years that the Act has been
in force it has done, in my opinion, wonderfui
work.
Hon. Mr. King: I should like to correct the
honourable senator's statement that the class
of veterans comprised in the Act. included
those with smail pensions. The Act did not
deal with pensions.
Han. Mr. Assumie: What 1 meant was that
the board had power to make allowances to
veterans who had no pension at ail, or whose
pensions were insufficient, s0 that they and
their families would not suifer. As I have
said, the board has done excellent work.
At the present time 33,000 veterans and
their dependents receive assistance by way of
allowances under the Act, and if the first part
of this bll goes into eifect, approximately
3,000 more will be added, increasing the total
to 35,000 or 36,000.
The usual amount set aside each year for
distribution by the War Veterans Allowance
Board is $25 million, and it is expected that
another $3 million will be added, making a
total for this year, and perhaps subsequent
years, of about $28 million.
The present board, which is absolutely
free fromn politics, enjoys the confidence of
the veterans, and I do not know of any criticismn that has been made of it in the twenty
years it has been in existence. That is quite
a record. It is one of the boards to which
you can freely go if you are making repreyou sit
sentations on behaîf of a veteran:
down at a table with the five commissioners,
read over the file and frankly discuss the
case in hand, and then go away fully satisfied that the whole matter has been deait with
in a f air and proper manner. I arn afraid
that if Part V goes into force this kind of thing
will be at an end, because we have been told
that it is proposed to, set up sixteen provisional district boards for the whole of Canada.
I know of no demand for any such thing. No
representation has been made for this fromn
our local organization, of which I happen to
be honorary president. I arn absolutely
opposed to the establishment of these district
boards. The mînister has stated that they
would tend to speed Up the handling of veterans' applications for assistance, but I do flot
agree.

SENATE

My chief objection to the setting up of
these district boards is that for the most part
the men in charge will be inexperienced. The
present board in Ottawa consists of five commissioners, and there is a trained staff of
sixty, who are kept busy checking applications and so on. I ask, honourable senators,
do you think that a regional board in Toronto
could handle an application for veteran's
allowance more expeditiously and capably
than the central board which sits in Ottawa,
where all the military and other pertinent
records are readily available? Do you suppose that a board in Winnipeg or any other
city could speed things up? It is more than
likely that these district boards across Canada
would be obliged to keep referring to the
central board in Ottawa for information
before they could render a proper decision.
I am afraid also that we shall have sixteen
different kinds of decisions.
As I said before, in my opinion the present
board is absolutely free of politics. But can
anyone suggest that these district boards will
not have a lot of pressure brought to bear
upon them in the making of decisions? I think
they will; I should be ,surprised if it were
otherwise. And their decisions will be final.
Of course, an applicant who is dissatisfied
with the decision of a district board will be
able to appeal to the central board at Ottawa,
which is to continue in existence. But suppose
an applicant in Vancouver is granted say $50 a
month, and the local board's finding is forwarded to the central board. Can anyone
imagine that the central board will of its own
volition reduce that allowance, or rule that no
allowance at all should have been granted? I
do not think that will happen at all. I think
the central board will be placed in an unfortunate position, for politics are bound to enter
into the decisions of the district boards.
Instead of saving expense the new procedure will, I submit, be more costly-for a
long time, at any rate-because the district
boards, being composed of members inexperienced in these matters, will be obliged to write
back and forth to the central board at Ottawa
for information and direction.
Those are the chief reasons for my objection
to the bill.
I will indicate now what I hope will happen.
Honourable members will have noticed that
the first line of Part V reads:
The minister may establish regional districts ...
My hope is that, even though the bill does
become law, the minister will consider what
I have said and take time to go into the whole
matter carefully before deciding whether this
Part should be put into effect.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I did
not know this matter was coming up today,

and I regret that I was not present at the
committee when Part V was being discussed.
I am inclined to concur entirely in what has
just been said by the honourable gentleman
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
The War Veterans' Allowance Board has
been in existence for twenty-odd years and
has built up a good record throughout Canada.
When the original legislation was introduced
I was minister of the department, and together
with the deputy minister and General Lafleche
-then Colonel Lafleche, who was at that time
president of the Canadian Legion-I went to
Montreal, where we consulted Sir Arthur
Currie, who had been the head of the Canadian forces overseas in the First War. He told
us that if the government adopted that
measure the veterans should be well satisfied
for years; and there is no doubt from what
has been said here today that it has served a
very useful purpose.
Without having any knowledge of what the
minister said in committee or what his
intentions are, I too hope that he will
thoroughly consider the matter before making
up his mind whether to establish the proposed regional boards. I cannot see the need
for them, unless the present department is to
be absorbed entirely into another. I trust that
the minister will study the question most
thoughtfully before he disturbs the existing
system, which has served well the veterans of
the First and Second World Wars and the
people of Canada as a whole.
Hon.

Thomas Reid: Honourable

senators,

when this bill first came before the Senate I
rose in my place and asked certain questions.
I was informed that the bill would be sent to
committee, where I would have an opportunity of getting the information I desired.
There was a reference to the Banking and
Commerce Committee, and at the first meeting when the bill was under discussion someone in the committee was good enough to
notify me in my room by messenger. As I
am not a member of the committee, that was
a nice courtesy to me. I then went to the
meeting and asked a number of questions of
officials present there, and I think I can say
without fear of successful contradiction that
the questions I had asked were not answered.
Before the committee adjourned it was
intimated that the officials could not give the
information I requested, and that the minister would be appearing at a later meeting.
Now, I know that I had the right to be
present at that later meeting, but I was not
aware when it was held. I presume that in
my absence another senator asked my questions which had been left unanswered. If
this was not done I consider the committee
was wrong in allowing the bill to go through
without giving me some notice, because at

the first meeting I appeared not only as a
senator, for the purpose of asking certain
questions of the officials, but also, in a sense,
as a witness.
I am a little perturbed to find this new
Part V in the bill, and I join with those who
have preceded me in protesting against it. I
wish to say here that I think a great deal of
credit is due to the senator from Kootenay
East (Hon. Mr. King), who introduced the
original War Veterans' Allowance Act-one
of the finest pieces of legislation that parliament has ever passed on behalf of returned
men. I pay tribute to the honourable gentleman for the wonderful work he did while
minister of the Department of Soldiers' Civil
Re-establishment.
I can quite understand
his dislike of the proposed change in the
present system, for, so far as I know, the
War Veterans' Allowance Board has given
complete satisfaction. I have never heard a
word of complaint against it. This board has
at Ottawa a staff of, I think, thirty-eight.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is sixty now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That may be so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what we were told
in committee, in answer to a question.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then, there has been an
increase in the staff-and the number of
employees will be much larger if this new
proposal for regional boards is adopted. I am
not against decentralization as such, for I
feel that many things now being done in
Ottawa could perhaps be done better in the
provinces. But the War Veterans' Allowance Board is one body whose work has been
entirely satisfactory, and I am wondering
what is behind the move for decentralization
in this instance.
Besides the staff at headquarters of the
War Veterans' Allowance Board, there are in
each province officials whose duty it is to
receive applications from returned men seeking an allowance. A veteran may apply
directly to the local officials or he may obtain
an application form and fill it out himself.
An unemployed veteran of sixty years or
more has a better chance than a younger man
of receiving an allowance, and anyone under
sixty must furnish a medical certificate to
show that he is incapable of working. In
every application the local officials clear the
decks, as it were, before the application is
sent to Ottawa. That is, they see to it that
all information required under the Act is
set forth. And when the board at Ottawa
receives the information, it follows the simple procedure of checking it over and thereupon deciding whether an allowance should
be granted or not.
When I was present at the committee I
asked what benefit would accrue from the

new set-up, and I was told that the handling
of applications by regional boards would
make for speedier decisions. I believe that
in many instances this will not be so. Let
me point out to the house what is a fairly
frequent procedure under the present system.
If the application of a veteran te the Canadian Pension Commission is rejected, on the
ground that he is ineligible for a pension, all
information accompanying the application is
then turned over to the War Veterans' Allowance Board. If the veteran then applies for
an allowance under the War Veterans' Allowance Act, this system expedites the handling
of the application. Many men whom I have
assisted in making application for pension
have been granted benefits under the War
Veterans' Allowance Act instead.
Subsection 2 of the new section 31 would
give to the district authorities all the powers,
duties and functions of the board under
Parts I, II, III and IV of the Act. I quite
agree with the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), that the
appointment of sixteen boards will result in
sixteen different interpretations of the Act.
My first complaint against the passage of
the bill is that the questions which were
asked in committee have not been, so far as
I am concerned, satisfactorily answered. The
Minister may have answered them-I do not
know.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Not to my satisfaction.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think a satisfactory answer
should be forthcoming. The specific question regarding men who served in the Italian
forces, and are now resident in Canada, has
not been answered. For instance, a man
may have served around Milan or Leghorn,
or some other place hundreds of miles from
the combat area; yet, after twenty years
residence in Canada, he becomes eligible for
the war veterans' allowance. I asked the
question: would a man who served in the
local Italian forces-not in a combat zoneand who has been resident in Canada for
twenty years, be eligible for the war veterans'
The answer was: "In most
allowance?
cases, yes".
I vigorously oppose the principle of this
bill for the reason that many Canadian lads
who volunteered for service in World War I,
and who through no fault of their own never
got out of England, would not benefit under
this measure. To be entitled to benefits, a
man in this category must have a disability
pension of at least 5 per cent from the first
war or be a veteran of the second war,
whereas the man who served in the local
forces of the Italian army and who has been
resident in Canada for twenty-five years,
becomes eligible for veterans' allowances.

SENATE
In most circumstances I am in favour of a
policy of decentralization, but in this case I
am very much against it. Where did the
complaints come from which brought about
the recommendation that the government set
up sixteen regional boards to do work that
is now being done by a central board in
Ottawa? I am sure that the additional boards
will mean more staff, with no improvement
in the administration of the Act. On these
grounds I strongly object to the bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: I do not think the
criticisms which have been voiced on third
reading of this bill should appear unchallenged in Hansard. Having attended all the
meetings of the committee at which this
measure was considered, I must say that I
derived an impression very different from
that of the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the honourable member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid).
May I deal first with the last point raised
by the honourable senator from New Westminster? Apparently he believes that under
this legislation a veteran of World War I who
served with our allies-that is, either a
French or an Italian soldier-in a garrison at
say Naples, in Italy, or Dijon in France, and
who has been resident in Canada for twenty
years, would be entitled to relief under this
legislation. The honourable member could
not have been at the meeting of the committee
when the minister was in attendance and
gave, in my view, very satisfactory answers.
The minister told us that section 2 of the bill
requires any such veteran to have served in
an actual theatre of war, which, in World
War I, was specifically defined as a place
Therefore, an

Italian veteran of that war who served only
in a garrison in Naples, and did not see

this bill. That point was made abundantly
clear to the committee, and in fact it follows
from the wording of the measure.
Now may I deal for a few minutes with
the criticisms of the honourable senator
He
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)?
objected to the power which Part V of the bill
gives to the minister, and pointed out, quite
properly, that it is a power which the minister
may or may not exercise, according to his
discretion.
The honourable senator objected to decentralizing the operations of the board
which are now carried on in Ottawa, and
to the establishment of sixteen regional
boards. It was explained in committee that
the local offices throughout the country have
been dealing with applications in the first
instance, and that, as one honourable senator
has said, they take all particulars of the

case. At the present time every applicant's
file has to be sent to Ottawa, where a final
decision is made by the central board. The
only purpose of this amendment is to permit
the local offices to render the final decision,
and thus avoid the delay of submitting the
case to the central board. The minister gave
committee positive assurance that the change
did not involve any additional expense to
the public, as the officers who will constitute the local boards are the same persons
who now deal with the applications in the
first instance.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I be permitted to ask
a question?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has my friend any information as to the present staff at the head
office in Ottawa, and whether or not it will
be reduced when the sixteen boards are
set up?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: We were informed
that the probable result of the passage of
Part V of the bill would be a reduction in
the staff at the head office, and perhaps an
increase in the personnel in the regional
offices; but the minister was very specific
in saying that he did not contemplate any
additional expense. The sole purpose of the
amendment, as I have said, is to permit
regional boards to deal with cases locally,
without referring them to Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. King: May I suggest to my
honourable friend that if we adopt that
principle in relation to war veterans' allowances, it must also apply to the whole pension administration in Canada. I do not
think that the minister would like to go that
f ar.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have no information
on that point.
Hon. Mr. King: Perhaps not, but I think I
should draw it to your attention.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It may be that the
minister is considering devolving the pension
administration as well.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In many cases the
veterans' allowance is much larger than a
pension would be.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should like to deal
rather specifically with the four objections
which my honourable friend has raised to
this measure.
He complained that the cases would be
dealt with by inexperienced local boards
that would not have the benefit of the experience and judgment possessed by the
central board at Ottawa. The answer to
that point is perhaps twofold. As I have

JUNE 15, 1950
already said, the men who will constitute
these local boards are the very men to whom
the applications are at the present time being
made, and who must therefore be expected
to have some experience.
My honourable friend also suggested that
the setting up of local boards throughout
the country would result in varying decisions.
But the legislation is careful to provide that
the central board shall have the power of
control over the local boards, and that it
can, if it so wishes, vary a ruling given by
any local board.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But for political reasons
that will not be done.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend's
third objection was that if local boards of
this kind are set up, they are not likely to be
free from local politics. Well, if the men
who are to constitute these local boards are
the men who are already in the employ of
the department, and who took the original
applications and forwarded them to Ottawa,
there is very little likelihood, it seems to me,
that any political implications will arise
merely because, instead of having them
collect the information and send it to Ottawa,
you give them the primary right to decide
the matter for themselves.
My honourable friend's fourth objection
was that this devolution would entail additional expense. I think I have already
answered that, in so far as it is possible for
me or any honourable senator to answer it,
by saying that the minister told us most
emphatically that this devolution would
involve as far as he knew, no additional personnel and no additional expense.
So, though I am glad that honourable
senators have expressed their views before
the house, I believe that those of us, or at
least a majority of us who attended the meetings of the committee at which these matters
were explained, derived a very different
impression of the effect of this legislation
from my honourable friend from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
Hon. Mr. Reid: If a man's application is
rejected by the local board, where will his
appeal lie? To a local board, or to Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Under section 32, his
appeal would be to the central board. That
section provides also that the central board
can of its own motion review any decision
made by a local board.

that I sent him word about the first meeting,
and thought he would probably know about
the next one.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The fault is mine.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am very much impressed
by the remarks of the honourable senator
from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), because
he is the man who initiated all this veterans'
allowance legislation. I attended every meeting of the committee, and one thing that is
as plain as the nose on anyone's face is that
there will be sixteen boards; and from my
experience it rarely happens that the type of
official who is employed to get local information or to receive applications and send them
to Ottawa, is as competent as a central board
to deal with problems of this kind. That is
one reason why I object to the bill.
I object also to decentralization. Who has
asked that these boards be set up? Apparently
the only person who thought of it was the
minister himself. I have never had such a
request, and none was made before the committee. I did not hear any representations
in favour of it either from the central board
or any of the veterans' organizations in my
province; and I may say that all of them
know me.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The minister said it
was his idea.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The minister admitted it
was his idea. Like the honourable senator
from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), I
know of no demand for the new set-up, nor
of any reason for it. The honourable gentleman who promoted the original act felt, as
I think all oY us did, that veterans who fell
within the categories named were in a difficult
position, and that they should be protected,
especially when they reached the age of
sixty. In that respect the legislation is all to
the good.
But, though I hope the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will be
justified in his expectations, I venture to
suggest that two years hence, if these boards
are established, the cost to the country will
be much greater than it is now. There will
be sixteen boards; and no doubt each board
will find that it must have secretaries and
stenographers, and the whole paraphernalia
of administration. That is how these things
always develop.
When my honourable friend from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) spoke of "political pressure", he did not mean pressure inspired from
CCF, Conservative or Liberal sources but
Hon. John T. Haig: With reference to the local pressure on a local organization. Central

representatives to Ottawa to present or support their claims; and this fact relieves a
body located at the capital from a great deal
of embarrassment. I had the honour, or the
burden, during the first World War of being
one of a committee set up under the Military
Service Act to decide, in a certain district of
Manitoba, whether this or that young man
should be required to serve. It was a very
difficult thing to do.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You were lobbied?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, we were not lobbied;
I will not say that. The late Mr. Stovel, I
remember, was one of my colleagues on this
committee, which served in the eastern half
of Manitoba; and we found that to give a
decision was much more difficult when some
young man came in person to present his case
than when the representations were made in
writing. We all know that if, as members of
some committee, we meet applicants face to
face, we do not like to turn them down;
usually we postpone consideration until a
subsequent meeting, and we may decide
against them then. That is human nature.
Under this bill personal applications will
be made to sixteen tribunals. I admit that
this arrangement is more convenient to applicants. But remember, awards in their favour
are a matter of grace. Their legal entitlement to allowances would be under the
Pension Act, but their rights have been
exhausted. Both my honourable friend from
Rosetown and myself questioned the minister
quite closely on the matter of delays, and
what he had to say about the advantage
which would result from this bill was not
very convincing. In none of thèse cases is a
delay of a week or two a life-or-death matter.
There is, in any event, no claim in law. I
agree with the honourable senator from New
Westminster that in a matter of this kind
centralization makes for uniformity clear
across the country.
I shall not vote against the bill, because if
I did it might be misunderstood by the veterans, and we do not want to hurt anybody's
feelings. But I honestly believe that the
minister's policy as embodied in this bill is
wrong. Holding the views he does, he should
first have reviewed the history of the department and the dealings with veterans over
the past twenty years, and then have shown
the existence of a real demand from all over
the country for the establishment of these
boards. He has done neither of these things.
If we vote for this bill we shall be voting to
set up these boards. It is quite clear to me
that such is the minister's intention, and that
it is his idea: apparently no one else evolved
or contributed to it. I could understand how
a minister, acting under pressure, might put

on the statute books legislation of a permissive nature, allowing himself plenty of
time to put it into effect.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: May I at this point
ask the honourable senator a question? He
said that he has had no complaints about the
Act and no requests for boards of this kind.
Has he not had any complaints about delay
in the hearing of applications? I have had
many complaints about delays encountered in
dealing with applications once they have
reached Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have been in this city only
fifteen years, but it has been my experience
that whenever I made inquiries on these
matters I always received satisfactory replies.
I remember, for instance, inquiring as to
whether or not a man had been legally married, and on another occasion my question
was directed to whether a certain applicant
for allowance had served in a bona fide
theatre of war. Those questions had to be
answered, and I must say that as a member
of the opposition I certainly would have
raised an issue had I received any real complaint. I remember one complaint being
made, but it did not reach the Board. A
certain individual was seeking a pensionit was not an allowance-and I placed the
facts before the minister, who gave the matter

young man placed in the Deer Lodge Hospital
in Winnipeg for two weeks, where he was
examined by competent medical authorities.
I was pleased with the manner in which the
minister dealt with this case, and when he
refused the application I felt that he was
quite justified in doing so. I knew the parents
of this boy, and I was able to explain to them
why their son's application had been refused.
That was the only case where any real
question was raised, and to my mind it was
answered just as satisfactorily as the routine
inquiries I had made about marriage certificates and so on.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In some cases the
inquiry has to do with domicile?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. When the question
came up about increasing pensions, the parents of many boys who had served in the war
came to me with requests of various kinds;
but I have never heard any demand or seen
anything in the press about setting up these
regional boards. I told the minister this, and
he admitted that it was his own idea. I think
my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) will agree on that.
I hope the minister will not put this part of
the Act into effect until he looks into the
matter more carefully. Perhaps some of the
things we have said today will help him in

JUNE 15, l9O
making a final decision. The honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
will agree that the minister was fearful
about the amount of work that would be
involved in taking in an additional 3,000
people under the Act. This may give him
grounds for not putting this Part of the bill
into effect; but whatever he does we shall
have to abide by his decision.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May 1, with the indulgence of the house, be permitted to make one
further observation? It seems to me that
in suggesting the idea of setting up regional
boards, the minister is probably following a
successful precedent established in the early
part of the war. Honourable members may
recall the Dependents Board of Trustees,
which was established to adjudge claims
made by the dependents of servicemen for
special allowances in cases of hardship, such
as illness, fire and so on. I happened to be
chairman of the Dependents Board of
Trustees for Military District No. 4, and I
should imagine that throughout the country
the organization was set up on a regional
basis much in the same way in which the
minister proposes to set up the district boards
to handle applications for veterans' allowances. In the case of the Dependents Board
of Trustees, regional boards were set up in
each military district, and had the power to
adjudge claims for special allowances that
were made to them from within the respective military districts. A central board operated in Ottawa. It had the power to revise
the decisions of the regional boards and to
give directives every now and then as to the
basis on which the regional boards should
make their decisions.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: Were those boards not
operating on a temporary basis?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: They were in effect for
five years.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is what I mean.
This is going to be something permanent.

55950-33à

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The point is that the
Dependents Board of Trustees functioned on a
regional basis and enabled dependents in each
district to apply directly to the board in their
own particular district. A person living in
Vancouver, for instance, did not have to apply
to a board in Ottawa. In the result, the
individual regional committees were able to
reach almost identical conclusions and to
award approximately the same allowances for
the same types of claims. It was only on the
rarest occasion that the central board had to
alter a decision made by a regional board. I
just wanted to point out to the bouse that
this type of organization-with regional
boards making local decisions, and a central
board having the power to revise all caseshas already been found to be extremely
satisfactory.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, on division, and passed.

My only object is to economize time as much

Hon. Mr. Haig: Fortunately I have had an
opportunity of reading the bill, which is for
the most part a consolidation of the present

which deals with the position of a person who
by reason of marriage or some other circumstance, is deemed to be a national of two
countries. The bill is not, I confess, easy
to understand, and I think it should be referred to committee, where questions could

is a lengthy bill and will take up a lot of
time in committee. Personally I should like

be referred to committee; and the details categories.

JUNE 19, 1950
I do not propose to detain the house with
the consideration of these minor changes, but
there are a few additional amendments
importing new matter into the legislation,
and I think it would be well for honourable
senators to have them under their consideration. To some extent these are changes in
substance, and the first relates to section 5
of the present Act which provides that a
person is a natural-born Canadian citizen if
he is born in Canada or on a Canadian ship.
In view of the change in methods of transportation that have taken place in the last
few years, one alteration which has been
made to section 5 is to widen -the definition of
a Canadian ship so as to include a Canadian
airplane. I do not know whether it is likely
that many people will be born in Canadian
airplanes; but if they are, by this amendment they will automatically become Canadian citizens.
The sêcond change in section 5 has been
brought in to deal with the cases of families
of diplomats and of ambassadors accredited
to this country to whom happy events occur
while they are in Canada. I do not know how
extensive the birth rate is in the ambassadorial corps, but I think honourable senators
will appreciate 'that if the wife of the Ruritanian ambassador to Canada, for instance,
should happen to give birth here to a child
where her husband is occuping the position
of ambassador to this country, it is not right
that that child should automatically become a
Canadian citizen. Section 5 has been accordingly amended by exempting from the general
provision those children born in Canada to
persons who are here in the diplomatic
service of foreign countries.
The next change was referred to by the
honourable leader of the other side (Hon. Mr.
Haig) a moment or two ago. It is a widening
and enabling provision dealing with the case
of any married woman who has lost her
Canadian citizenship either by marrying a
national of another country or because her
husband, though originally a Canadian, has
become a citizen of another country. This
amendment, which is to be found in subsection 3 of section 10, provides that any such
woman may apply to the minister for permission to resume her Canadian citizenship,
and the minister may grant a certificate of
Canadian citizenship in those circumstances.
Cases of this kind are not infrequent. A
Canadian woman marries a citizen of the
United States, for instance. He may spend
the whole of his life in Canada without
becoming a Canadian citizen, but upon his
death his widow may wish to resume her
status as a Canadian citizen.
A further provision is for the assistance of
people who happen to have lost their

Canadian nationality under circumstances
other than marriage. Suppose, for instance,
a child is born to a Canadian father and
mother who subsequently go to the United
States, where the father becomes naturalized.
Should the child later return to live in Canada
and wish to resume the nationality which he
originally had at birth, he may, upon submitting proper proof, obtain a certificate of
Canadian citizenship from the minister.
A provision which will be found in section
6 of the bill is designed for the benefit of
children who are not Canadian citizens but
are adopted by Canadian citizens. The provision, which is an addition to the present
Act, is that the minister, in his discretion may
grant a certificate of citizenship to a child
who has been lawfully admitted to Canada
and who has been adopted in the Canadian
courts by a citizen of Canada. The same
applies to a child who has been legitimized,
if the father of the child is a Canadian citizen.
On page 11 of the bill honourable senators
will find a change dealing with citizens of
the Republic of Ireland whose status has
been a matter of some doubt since Ireland
formally left the confines of the British Commonwealth. Subsection 3 of section 23 of the
Act, as it is now proposed to be amended,
provides that for purposes of Canadian law
citizens of the Republic of Ireland shall be
considered as being British subjects.
Two other points in connection with section
23 I think deserve consideration. The first
is that subsection 1 declares that every person
who is a citizen of one of the countries listed
in the schedule to the bill has in Canada the
status of a British subject. The countries
listed are Australia, Canada, Ceylon, India,
New Zealand, Pakistan, Southern Rhodesia,
the Union of South Africa and the United
Kingdom.
Subsection 2 of section 23 of the bill con:
tains the new term "commonwealth citizen",
which apparently is used instead of "British
subject" by some of the member countries of
the commonwealth. This section states that
anyone in Canada who has the status of a
British subject may be called a "British subject" or a "commonwealth citizen", and that
the terms shall have the same meaning.
The only other proposed amendment to
which I should draw the attention of honourable senators is a procedural matter. It
is section 19 of the bill, which would amend
section 46 of the Act. In effect it states that
naturalization proceedings begun, but not
completed prior to January 1, 1947, under the
old Naturalization Act-which was repealed
and replaced by the Canadian Citizenship
Act, shall be allowed to continue as if the.

apparent reason for this change is that after
the lapse of some time a number of people
who had started proceedings under the
Naturalization Act had obtained their naturalization papers under this Act, that the Department of Justice gave the opinion that that
procedure was not correct, and that in the
Canadian Citizenship Act there was no machinery by which proceedings under the
Naturalization Act could be continued. In fact,
I understand that the courts in one of the
western provinces gave a judgment to that
effect. This would result in considerable
hardship on, for instance, a man who in the
middle of 1946 filed his declaration of
intention to apply for Canadian citizenship
under the Act then in force, and a year later
was informed that his notice of intention was
ineffective and that he would have to begin
all over again. This amendment, which declares that naturalization proceedings commenced under the Naturalization Act can be
continued and completed under the Canadian
Citizenship Act, is designed to be of benefit in
cases of that kind. It is also provided that
subsection 3 of this section shall be deemed to
have come into force on January 1, 1947. In
that way the new section covers l11 cases
about which there might be any doubt if ithis
provision had not been included.
I think, honourable senators, that I have
covered all the principal changes provided
for by the bill. As the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) has said, it is a
fairly substantial bill and involves a good
deal of redrafting of some of the provisions
of the present Act. I am quite certain that
if the bill is referred to a standing committee
honourable senators will consider the proposed amendments with the care, which this
house always shows in dealing with legislation of this character.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

the said Niagara Diversion Treaty, signed at Toronto
on March 27, 1950, and that this House do approve
same.

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose

of the treaty which this resolution would
approve is to provide for the permanent
regulation of the diversion of water from the
Niagara river, and also to guarantee a sufficient flow of water to protect the scenic
beauty of the river and the falls.
The diversion of water from the Niagara
river was first regulated in 1909 by Article
V of the Boundary Waters Treaty. This provision permitted the United States to divert
20,000 cubic feet of water per second, and
cubic feet per second.
Canada 36,000
Although Canada was permitted to use more
water than the United States, she exported to
that country much of the resulting electric
power. In this way the use of diverted
waters from the Niagara river made approximately the same amount of additional electric
power, available to both countries.
The Second World War caused a very
heavy demand for additional electricity. After
negotiations, the United States was authorized
to divert an additional 12,500 cubic feet of
water per second, and Canada 13,000 cubic
feet per second. These authorizations were
made on a temporary basis only. The end of
the war saw the demand for electric power
still increasing, and it ýbecame evident that
there was great need for a permanent agreement on the diversion of water from the
Niagara river. In consequence, discussions
were held in Washington last December, and
this treaty was signed on February 27, 1950.
The previous agreements as to the use of
Niagara water specified the amount of water
ea.ch country could use. The remaining water
would flow over the falls. In this treaty the
procedure is reversed: Article IV reserves
definite quantities of water that will flow over
the falls, and Article V authorizes the use
of all remaining 'water for power purposes.
It is considered that this method of diversion
will provide the most effective use of available

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament

the Niagara Diversion Treaty between Canada and

on February 27, 1950, and do approve an agreement
between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Ontario with respect to

disposal, the Canadian export licenses for

conditions at that time make such a course
advisable.
The treaty further provides for certain
works to maintain the scenic beauty of the
falls. In 1929 the International Niagara Board

JUNE 19, 1950
recommended that works be carried out which
would so distribute the water as to produce
an unbroken crestline on the falls.
Article II is to provide for these works
when plans have been drawn up by the
International Joint Commission and approved
by both governments.
This treaty is of primary interest to the
Province of Ontario. For this reason representatives of that province were present in
an advisory capacity at the negotiations in
Washington; and the treaty has the approval
of the Ontario Government.
On the Canadian side, the object of the
treaty is to provide more power for Ontario,
and that province has recognized that it should
assume any financial commitments which
result from it. Accordingly, on May 27 last,
an agreement was signed at Toronto between
the federal and the provincial governments.
This agreement provides that Ontario will pay
the cost of all work which may be necessary
under Article Il. For its part, the Canadian
Government undertakes to consult the Government of Ontario before it approves any
plans of the International Joint Commission
which have to do with the nature of such
works.
It is hoped that the United States will ratify
this treaty as soon as possible; but I wish to
emphasize that this redevelopment at Niagara
will in no respect take the place of the power
development which this country so urgently
needs and which it expects to obtain from the
development of the St. Lawrence.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADA-UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
TAX CONVENTIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill K-10, an Act to amend
the Canada-United States of America Tax
Convention Act, 1943, and the Canada-United
States of America Tax Convention Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to approve certain amendments
of the existing tax conventions between Canada and the United States. These amendments have reference only to the income tax
and succession duty fields. They have been
approved by both the Canadian and the
United States governments.
The basic principles of the tax conventions
are in no way altered by these proposed
changes. In many cases the present principles are extended to give greater relief to
the taxpayer; in other cases the changes are
designed to clarify the existing conventions.
In no case is it anticipated that the amendments will result in an increased burden to
any taxpayer.

I do not propose to deal in detail with the
many technical changes; but in order to
indicate the general principles that are
involved, I shall make some reference to the
chief amendments.
One of these seeks to broaden the exemptions applicable to persons of one country
temporarily performing services in the other
country. This provision has worked very
satisfactorily since the convention was signed,
and it has been decided to go further in the
same direction.
Both countries agree to
abolish taxation at the source on literary
royalties paid to residents in the other
country. Another provision will permit professors and teachers from either country to
work temporarily-up to two years-in the
other, without being taxed by the country in
which they are visitors. Provision is made to
remove hardship in cases where employers in
both countries simultaneously levy a tax on
the same salary.
These are examples of changes affecting
the income tax field and which further simplify the existing problems of double taxation
between the two countries.
The main proposed amendment to the Succession Duty Convention is the insertion of a
codification of the rules of situs of property.
This codification follows generally the pattern worked out between Canada and the
United Kingdom, and represents a step
towards greater uniformity in the provisions
of our tax conventions in this field. The rules
of situs of property generally conform to the
common law, although certain departures
have been made in the interest of administrative convenience and simplicity.
I have no doubt that the, bill contains
other matters in respect of which honourable
senators will desire information, and if the
house sees fit to give it second reading I
shall be quite willing to have it referred to
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have no comment to
make on the bill, which I have read. I
should like to have it sent to committee, not
in order to ensure its passage, but so that we
may the better understand its provisions.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTSCONSENT OF PROVINCES
MOTION

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
8, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Marcotte:
That in the opinion of the Senate, whenever an
amendment to the constitution of Canada is made,
or is to be made, requiring the consent of one or
more of the provinces, the said consent can only be
expressed by act or by resolution of the legislature
or legislatures of the provinces concerned.

Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I am sure that we are all very
grateful to the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) for the obvious
care and thought which were reflected in the
speech he delivered here some ten days ago
in support of the resolution that is now
before us. I should like to express to him
my appreciation of the very fine record of
loyalty to this chamber which he revealed
during the course of his remarks, and the
hope that he may be spared many years to sit
in this chamber and give us the continued
benefit of his presence.
Some Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I also desire to acknowledge the contribution made in this debate
by my good friend and colleague the senator
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin). I shall
have occasion to refer to certain statements
of his later on. In dealing with the legal
rights as distinguished from the broad point
of view of interest, which I intend to
emphasize, he approached the matter from a
point of view entirely different from my own.

I must say, however, that his speech, replete
with a wealth of documentation and full of
erudition, will be a valuable source of historical information for those of us who wish
to pursue this subject in the future.
As I listened to the remarks of my honourable friend from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte)
and upon having read them later, I found
very little difference between us. As a matter of fact I came to the conclusion that his
resolution represented a peg upon which a
good many hats can be hung; but in view of

the pending discussions between federal and
provincial authorities it seemed to me that
this resolution might be regarded as a hypothetical one. It suggests that when the time
comes for any amendment to the constitution
of Canada requiring the consent of a province or provinces, thorough-going democratic
procedure should be followed and such
amendments should be embodied in an Act
of the legislature of the province affected.
The honourable senator did not say so in his
speech or in the resolution to which he
addressed himself, but I assume that he
would not be averse to having the same procedure followed in the Parliament of Canada.
In that way there would at no time be any
chance of constitutional changes being made
without full representative action being taken
by all parties concerned.
In his speech supporting his resolution the
senator from Ponteix indicated that such procedure should have been followed in the past,
and certainly should be followed in the
future. He held that the Senate is responsible
for insisting upon such practice. He said:
The Senate is the protector of the rights of the
The Senate represents the provinces
provinces . ..
. . . The Senate is important not only for what it

does, but for what it prevents others from doing.
My honourable friend referred particularly
to the Family Allowances Bill of 1944-45, and
to the Redistribution Bill passed in the session of 1946, claiming that these measures
should have been the subject of consultation
with the provinces before being made law.
While I do not agree with some of the statements made by my honourable friend during
the course of his speech, I simply wish at this
time to point out that anything I may have
said or written outside about the Senate and
the Parliament of Canada is not contradicted
by anything contained in the honourable senator's resolution or speech. As a matter of
fact, had it not been for the very friendly
references the honourable gentleman made
to myself, I doubt if I should have risen to
speak on this resolution; but his courteous
allusions to the statements I made elsewhere
certainly demanded from me the corresponding courtesy of making a reply.
The point that I have endeavoured to make
in any remarks of mine is that whatever may
have been expected to happen in this chamber
following confederation is very different from
what has happened. The honourable senator
from Ponteix says that the Senate represents
the provinces and is the protector of the
rights of the provinces. In contrast to these
claims, I maintain that the record since confederation does not show any such thing. If
the honourable gentleman is right in his
claims, then, I ask, "Why has not the Senate

JUNE 19, 1950
fulfilled its duties?" If I may answer this
question at once, I would say that the historical reasons for the beginnings of our
confederation have been overshadowed by
the realities of political growth. That, I take
it, is the real reason why an attempt is now
being made to overhaul the constitutional
machinery of this country.
Nobody can possibly dispute the importance of the Senate as a factor in making
confederation possible. We are ýall familiar
with what was involved in the principle of
equal territorial representation in our second
chamber. The Honourable George Brown,
as the honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) pointed out in his learned
speech, made this quite -clear during the
confederation debates of 1865 in the Parliament of Upper and Lower Canada. But the
working out and development of our federal
system, with its emphasis upon strong central
government, has now made necessary a
clarification and re-definition of constitutional relations between the provinces and
the dominion. As to the Honourable George
Brown's statement, which was absolutely
correct and true in 1865, I should like to
mention that he spoke after the discussions
in Quebec in 1864, when the famous Quebec
resolutions were adopted. Those discussions
were the basis of the declaration by the
Parliament of Upper and Lower Canada in
1865; but that declaration was made and
put on record without having had the benefit
of the discussions which took place in London
in 1866, when the resolutions which were
agreed upon, with the support and participation of the representatives of -the Maritime Provinces, formed the real basis of the
British North America Act.
I think that when we refer to the theory
of compact which Brown supported we
should remember that he was speaking only
on behalf of those representing Upper and
Lower Canada. It is true they represented
the vast majority of the people in the country
at that time, but they did not speak for the
final act of agreement on the part of all the
parties to confederation.
In dealing with this question and in considering the broad political situation in this
country, both domestic and international, I
think it is important to avoid any suggestion
that "dominion" and "provinces" are mutually exclusive terms. The dominion and
the provinces are complementary to each
other; indeed they are more essential to
each other today than ever before.
My good friend the senator from De Salaberry said that the plan of his address was
to describe the nature of the rights of the
provinces as defined by the Privy Council.
55950-34

I shall not attempt to discuss this question
from the point of view of legal rights. I
shall try to emphasize broad political and
social interests as distinct from rights. My
thesis here is the encouragement of national
unity in this country, and the more effective
use of the Senate to that end. Every Canadian
has his or her well-defined threefold citizenship-municipal, provincial and federal-and
a fourth dimension is taking the form of an
international citizenship, the approach to
whch obviously lies across the federal field.
When the senator for De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) declared, "We must always
remember that federalism was the cradle of
our Canadian nation", I was in entire agreement with him; but when a moment or two
later he said, "In my opinion, independence
in financial matters is essential, but nothing
exceeds in importance the status of minorities", I could not agree.
I find myself asking: What does financial
independence in provincial matters mean?
What about the rights of majorities? What
about the parts being greater than the whole?
I am inclined to believe that financial
independence in provincial matters in this
country means, in the long run, the independence of the two principal beneficiaries
of confederation, namely, Ontario and Quebec; and the dependence of all the other
provinces on something else-something outside themselves, something more equitable in
the distribution of material welfare than was
the machinery that functioned prior to 1940.
My object here, however, is to connect the
Senate with these federal and provincial
problems in a more vital way than has been
evident in the past. In support of anything
that I may have said or written outside this
chamber about the position of the Senate as
a guardian of provincial rights and interests,
I wish to quote briefly a few extracts from
a book which doubtless is well known to
members of this chamber, The Unreformed
Senate of Canada, by Robert A. Mackay.
Even though published in 1926, it is still, I
think, the best source of reference on the
Senate. To senators particularly interested
in reading a little more widely on this subject,
I would commend especially pages 74 to 77,
81 to 96 and 118 to 145. In those sections of
the book may be found not only a long list
of examples of legislation in which the Senate
has exercised considerable influence, but
some very interesting comments as well. I
shall quote some of these comments briefly,
first from page 138:
The career of the Senate as the protector of
provincial and sectional rights, the role it was
ostensibly created to play, has been a varied one.
In part this is due to the fact that the Senate is
only incidentally the protector of the provinces or
of the sections, and performs such duties only

SENATE
through its functions as a secondary branch of the
legislature . . . The Senate, therefore, bas rarely
been appealed to as the champion of provincial
rights, and, as the following instances will show,
even when appealed to it bas net consistently supported the claims of the provinces.

dominion was involved, since the watershed Included dominion lands within the Province of
Manitoba and extended across the international
boundary line . . .

There follows a quite extensive list of
instances where the Senate has exercised its
influence in relation to measures that affect
provinces, particularly with reference to the
franchise; and, I should say, in more cases
than not, the Senate has exercised its influence in deciding against the province. For

On the dangerous questions of language and
education the Senate has consistently followed the
lead of the House of Commons.

example:
In 1874 the Mackenzie government brought in a
bill to accept the provincial franchise in every
province, except Prince Edward Island where manhood suffrage existed. The Senate amended the bill
so as to accept the island's franchise as it stood, and,
despite the opposition of the government, carried
its point. Similarly, in 1898, when the Laurier government passed through the Commons a bill to readopt the provincial franchise, the Senate again
compelled the Commons to accept an amendment
protecting that of Prince Edward Island. On the
other hand, in 1885, when a federal franchise was
established, the Senate acquiesced on a strict party
vote. Again in 1918, on the Woman Suffrage Bill,
the majority of the Senate refused to accept amendments offered in the interests of the provinces which
had not yet adopted woman suffrage.
In some cases, indeed, the Senate bas declared
flatly against the policy of a province. Thus in the
bill of 1882 the Senate inserted an amendment to
enfranchise government railway employees in Nova
Sceotia who had been disenfranchised by the provincial government. On the Franchise Bill of 1898 it
insisted on amendments requiring the allowance of
appeal to the courts in New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, and Manitoba, where there were property
qualifications for the suffrage, and where the
assessor's estimate of property determined the right
of the citizen to vote ...
On several occasions the Senate has refused requests of provincial governments for legislation.

For example, in 1879 the Government of
British Columbia asked for an additional
judge for the Suprerne Court of the province,
and in 1900 the Government of Quebec asked
to have three new judgeships created in
the province; but the Senate refused each of
these requests, on the ground that it was
made on the eve of an election and that the
Senate should not do anything which might
affect the course of the election. I wish to
refer to this expression of view later, when
I come to some more modern measures to
which my honourable friend referred.
Another instance mentioned in the book is
the stand taken by the Senate as to the Lake
of the Woods Control Board. I am reading
from the bottom of page 139:
In 1919 the Government of Ontario and the federal
government agreed to set up a joint control board
over the Lake of the Woods watershed. The Ontario
Government, failing to carry out its part of the
bargain, requested that dominion legislation providing for the board should be repealed. The Dominion
Government brought in a repeal bill in 1922 and
1923, but on each occasion the Senate rejected the
bill on the ground that the general interest of the

And on page 140:

Instances cited are the Manitoba Act of 1875,
the Northwest Territories Amendment Bill
of 1890, and, in 1905, the bills creating the
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The
author adds:
Although from time to time resolutions on the
rights of racial and religious minorities have been
introduced and debated at length, the Senate has
rarely added fuel to the lire of racial and religious
strife.

There is one marked exception in which
the Senate can take credit for having definitely intervened on behalf of the provinces.
J refer to the introduction by the government in 1903 of legislation to set up a

railway
various railway Acts. At that time the Senate
refused to allow the control of the provinces
and municipalities over local railways to be
disturbed, and the point of view of this house
prevailed. In dealing with that question in
1919, when the Crow's Nest Pass agreement
between the Canadian Pacific Railway and
the provinces of Manitoba and British
Columbia was at stake, this chamber, under
the leadership of Sir James Lougheed, refused
to pass the House of Commons bill that had
been submitted to it asking for the cancellation of the contract. I think tribute should
be paid, especially by the western members,
to the stand taken by Sir James Lougheed
and the members of the Senate at that time.
The author goes on to say:
Such instances throw much doubt on the value of
the Senate as a guardian of provincial or sectional
rights. Party loyalty has always been stronger in
the Senate than sectional or provincial loyalty. The
only important case in which the Senate withstood
the government of the day on the grounds of provincial rights, when the same party was in the
majority in both Houses, was the Railway Acts
Consolidation Bill of 1903 already mentioned.

At page 144 of the text I find this paragraph:
In addition to party tics there are other reasons
why the Senate is not a mirror of provincial or
sectional opinion.
The majority of its members
have had long apprenticeship in public life or in
business or professional life. The horizon of the
political world for such members is wider than the
province or section. Indeed, the Commons, because
it reflects in its membership the opinions of the
electorate, is much more likely to represent provincial and sectional opinion than the Senate is. In
addition, the prospect of the next election is con-

stantly before a member of the Commons.

His ear,

therefore, is nearer to the ground, and his eyes
more closely upon the Press Gallery than are those
of a senator.

JUNE 19, 1950
The paragraph which I shall now read is
particularly appropriate and seems to support
my thesis. It says:
The desire for an upper bouse which will protect
the proirinces or the sections is a relie of pre-federation particularism, a theoretical consideration rather

than a practical necessity of the present. The pro-

tection of legal rights afforded by the courts, the
federal nature of the party and of the cabinet,

the representation afforded each province or section
in the Commons, are surer bulwarks than any upper
bouse could be.
I conclude my quotations with ithis final
paragraph:
Even if the Senate represented nothing but party
loyalty it would be of greater utility to the dominion

than an upper bouse constructed strictly on provincial or sectional lines, for the very reason that the
party in Canada is a nationalizing force which tends
to adjust conflicting sectional and provincial in-

terests, and to subordinate them to the national
welf are.

I come now to 'the Senate as we have it
today. First may I point out that since 1926,
when the book to which I have referred was
published, we have seen examples of legislation which I think go to prove my argument
that the Senate has not particularly represented the provinces. I would point to the
Family Allowances bill and to the Redistribution bill of 1946, both of which were passed
by this house and the other house without any
insistence on provincial rights, except my
honourable friend's suggestion that the provinces should be consulted. I may also mention the private bill having to do with oleomargarine, which' was introduced by the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler). I did not hear anyone but my honourable friend argue that the Dairy Industry
Act was ultra vires of the federal parliament
and should be considered as within the
provincial jurisdiction. It remained for the
court to arrive at a decision in that matter,
and results were achieved which apparently
were not possible in the Parliament of Canada. It seems to me that such instances affect
the entire function of the Senate in its relation to provincial rights.
The method of making appointments to the
Senate is still pre-eminently a matter of
party consideration; but I believe that for
the past ten years the Senate, in its devotion
to legislation and special issues of the day
that came before it, has been .more independent than at any other time since confederation.
One could cite examples to support that contention, but time does not permit.
There is, however, a reason for the trend
towards a greater degree of independence.
The changes that have taken place in political
party interests in Canada have had their
effect, particularly in the attitude towards
measures which come before this house.
Canada now has four parties, whereas she
55950-341

formerly had two. We may conclude that
in connection with party policies we have
seen a marked trend away from fundamental
and historical principles, distinguishing one
from the other, to a basis of expediency
and opportunism. In the use of those words
one is conscious that the whole organized
business life is more or less on the same
basis today. An institution having in its
charge business considerations must adjust
itself to the principles of the day. It is
impossible to lay down long-term plans and
fundamental ideas for the operation of any
business. It is natural enough in face of
the course of world affairs since and before
the last war, that governments and parties
have felt compelled to resort to what may
be described as expediency and opportunism.
But that development should make it easier
for members of this second chamber, who are
supposed to be actuated by motives of nonpartisanship and of justice, to consider in the
light of those principles the work which
comes before them.
I refer here to the point of view which
was forcibly expressed in 1932 by our venerable senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth). He maintained that the standpoint of the Senate and its members should
be essentially non-partisan and judicial. He
added that he would even favour the introduction and adoption of legislation to disfranchise the members of this house so that
they could the more consistently take an
impartial attitude when legislation came before them; in other words, they would be
in the same position as the members of the
Bench. I doubt that we are yet ready to
adopt this suggestion, but I believe that the
changes in connection with party policy which
have taken place, the difficulty of identifying
party policies with traditional principles and
fundamentals, have released members of
parliament from conventions to which in the
past they felt duty bound to adhere. Therefore, it seems to me, the effect of party
influence on the deliberations of the Senate
is declining, in favour of a more detached
and judicial point of view.
I was going to refer to exceptions to that
trend as indicated in the case of the Family
Allowances Bill of 1945 and the Redistribution
Bill of 1946. My honourable friend from
Ponteix alluded to the Family Allowances
Bill from the point of view of consultation
with the provinces. Although I do not share
this view, I have thought that the Senate
would have been justified in refusing to pass
the bill at that time because it was presented
to us on the eve of an election and without
any appreciable demand for it from any part
of the country. I think that, had the Senate
taken the same position that it adopted in

SENATE
years gone by when it refused to appoint
certain judges in British Columbia and
Quebec, it might have been on stronger ground
in relation to this whole question now before
us. It would have been on stronger ground
than if it had sought to prevent the bill from
going through on the basis that the provinces
should have been consulted. In connection
with the Redistribution Bill of 1946 in view
of the fact that, by the British North America
Act, Quebec was given a fixed representation
of sixty-five members, and the representation
of all other parts of Canada was based on that
allocation, I believe there was strong ground
for maintaining that the amendment of this
British North America Act at that time should
have been subject to consultation and
conference.
So far as the future is concerned, one can
only hope that the position of the Senate may
be strengthened by making it more selective
and less partisan in method of appointment.
As a step in this direction, I should like to see
the provinces given a measure of direct contact with the Senate, thereby developing its
influence into a great balancing power in a
consolidation of this country's national
interest.
We have discussed the question of whether
the Senate has been and is intended to be a
guardian of provincial rights. I have tried to
show that it has not exercised that guardianship in any particular way. I hold that it is
necessary that the provinces shall have a

greater stake in the federal interests of this
country, because, as I emphasized earlier, the
complementary relationship between the provinces and the dominion must be developed,
increased and improved, if Canada is to
achieve the destiny which the Fathers of
Confederation foresaw in 1867.
In conclusion, may I suggest that senators
must remember that they are members of an
integral part of the federal parliament. We
cannot approach any of our duties apart from
the standpoint of what is in the broad federal
or national interest. This does not imply the
exclusion of provincial interests. The provinces have a vital federal interest: it exists in
the common ground of mutual relations in
trade and commerce, in taxation, in defence,
in social standards and security. In short, it
exists in the sphere of all-round national welfare. Our duty is to see that matters of concern to the provinces are clearly and definitely
presented here, free from the partisan considerations which in the past may have stood
in the way. Our duty is to see that emphasis
is put in the right place, and that unity of
democratic purpose shall be promoted
throughout this land, regardless of language,
race or creed.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dupuis the debate

NATIONAL DEFENCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill 133, an Act respecting National
Defence.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, before the motion for third reading is
carried, I wish to make a few comments. I
should like them on record, because while
the bill has received a great deal of study
and attention, both in this house and in the
Commons, the fact remains that it is a long,
difficult and important measure. It is the
consolidation of what might be called the
Criminal Code of all three of the armed
forces of Canada. It presents the criminal
law of the services in a uniform way and
makes certain many things which in the past,
because of varying provisions applicable to
the separate forces, have been a bit hazy.
Thanks to this consolidation, many more
people will from now on understand what
the law is, as applied to the armed forces.
I think the bill will do a great deal of good.
Its general purpose is an excellent one, and
I am entirely in accord with it.
This is not the last that will be heard of
this legislation. The Criminal Code of Canada, which was adopted shortly after confederation, codified what prior to that time
had been the general law, the common law.
Prior to the first enactnent of the Code the
whole general law was thoroughly studied by
a commission in Britain, and afterwards
there was an intense study of it here. Yet,
year after year we have been amending
the Code; and I understand that at present
the Department of Justice is engaged in a
broad examination of its provisions and
general structure, with a view to its substantial reorganization. So it will not be
surprising if this National Defence Act,
despite the thorough study given to it in both
houses, comes back for amendment year
after year. And when I mention some difficulties as to certain clauses, I am, I think, only
anticipating amendments which will be presented in years to come.
The first clause of the bill to which I
should like to call attention is 240. I shall
refer to clauses in numerical order, rather
than in order of merit or importance. Clause
240 reads:
240. (1) Every person who
(a) procures, persuades, aids, assists or counsels
an officer or man to desert or absent himself with-

out leave; or

(b) in an emergency, aids, assists, harbours or
conceals an officer or man who is a deserter or an
absentee without leave and who does not satisfy
the court that he did not know that such officer or
man was a deserter or an absentee without leave,

is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary
conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand
dollars and not less than one hundred dollars or to
imprisonment for any term not exceeding twelve
months or to both fine and imprisonment.

In my opinion that clause is aimed at the
relatives-the father and mother, brothers and
sisters-and the civil acquaintances-perhaps
only chance acquaintances-of the soldier who
is absent without leave. I think it is a
bad policy to extend military offences to persons in civil life, and to give the military
authorities power to lay charges against the
relatives, neighbours or friends of a soldier
who is absent without leave-or is even a
deserter, which is much the same thing.
The army authorities should have to do
with preferring charges against service personnel, and not against members of the
public who may be guilty of such an offence
as this section mentions. As honourable senators know in our statutes we already have
laws covering such an offence. Section 84 of
the Criminal Code reads:
Every one is guilty of an offence and liable, on
summary conviction, to six months' imprisonment
with or without hard labour, who
(a) persuades any man who bas been enlisted ...
or
(b) knowing that any such man is about to desert,
aids or assists him in deserting.

The difference between section 240 of the
bill and section 84 of the Criminal Code
is that under the Code the Crown must establish that the accused knew that the soldier
was a deserter, whereas, under the 'bill the
obligation or burden of proof to show that he
did not know that the man was a deserter
is placed on the accused. In my opinion it
would have been much wiser to have continued to rely on the law as provided by
the Criminal Code.
The next point to which I should like to
turn-and which, as I have said, is not in
order of merit-has to do with appeals. I
most heartily approve of section 196 of the
bill which, for the first time, makes provision
for appeals from military tribunals to the
Supreme Court of Canada. Though the procedure outlined here is highly commendable
I do not like the provision that appeals are
to be restricted to cases in which there has
been dissent in the military board.
Subsection 1 of section 196 reads:
A person whose appeal has been wholly or partially dismissed by the Court Martial Appeal Board
may, where there bas been dissent in the board,
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada with leave
of the Attorney General of Canada.

That is to say, a person who considers himself aggrieved in some way by a decision of
the military board can take an appeal from
that decision, provided that there is dissent
on the military board and also that he gets the
consent of the Attorney General of Canada.

JUNE 20, 1960
Honourable senators well know that the
fact that a tribunal is unanimous in its decision is no complete guarantee of justice, or
that because a tribunal is not unanimous is
no sure indication of injustice, and I fail to
see any reason for providing that one of the
requisites of the right of appeal must be
dissent in the board. It would seem to me
that the consent of the Attorney General is
all that should be required. This section looks
all right, but in practice it is quite illusory;
and I predict that it will be used very infrequently, because it will rarely happen that
an accused will get both a dissent in the
board and the consent of the Attorney
General. The measure could be of considerable value, but, as I say, it is now purely
illusory.
Another clause to which I would draw
attention is section 121, subsection (6):
A person upon whom a punishment of dismissal
with disgrace from Ris Majesty's service has been
carried out shall not, except in an emergency or
unless that punishment is subsequently set aside or
altered, be eligible to serve His Majesty again in

any military or civil capacity.
Paragraph (d) of subsection (4) of this
section states:
Where a service tribunal imposes a punishment

of Imprisoniment for two years or more upon a man,
the service tribunal may in addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this part, Impose a
punishment of dismissal with disgrace from Ris
Maiesty's service.

So in both of these subclauses it is provided that to the penalty of two years' imprisonment there may be added-by a
military board-dismissal with disgrace. Of
course the offences for which this punishment can be imposed are fairly numerous.
One of the sections in which dismissal
with disgrace is specifically mentioned is
95:
Every person who wilfully or negligently or
through other default loses, strands or hazards, or
suffers to be lost, stranded or hazarded any of His
Majesty's Canadian ships or other vessels of the
Canadian forces is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable to dismissal with disgrace from Ris
Majesty's service or to less punishment.

That is but one of many clauses to which
my objection applies. Some captain of a
ship who does not exercise what is held to
be due caution, and thereby hazards-merely
hazards-his ship, or perhaps actually strands
it-as was done quite recently by an officer
of one of the United States capital shipsis subject to dismissal with disgrace.
Hon. Mr. Duff: It happened to one of our
own ships, too, only last year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It will happen in the
ordinary course of events, beyond peradventure, from time to time.

Hon. Mr. Haig: The American admitted he
was guilty.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Exactly. Yet he was
not dismissed with disgrace; at least I do
not think so. But I am sure that, had he
been dismissed with disgrace, the consequence of which I spéak, and to which I
object in connection with these particular
clauses, would not have followed. Of course
punishment must be handed out, but in my
view the events of military life should be
kept separate from those of civil life. The
military should handle the affairs strictly
within its own jurisdiction and pertaining to
military life; but a person who is dismissed
with disgrace, under such conditions as I
have mentioned-the loss, or stranding, or
the mere hazarding of a vessel, or any offence
which under the Code carries a punishment
of more than two years-should not be
debarred for the rest of his life from serving

His Majesty in any military or civil capacity.
What this means is that an individual, who
because of some event which took place in
connection with and during his military
service is so unfortunate as to incur this
penalty, is de-citizenized from that time
henceforth. He can hold no position in the
civil service. I do not suppose he could be
a member of parliament or of the Senateit is not likely that he would be eithernor could he hold any office in the service
of His Majesty. I submit that that provision is unjust. I am horrified at the
potentialities of such a penalty. I think
that when a man is kicked out with disgrace,
that should end it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If a sentence is imposed
he should serve it; but when, having done
so, he leaves the Army, he should be on the
same basis in civil life as other people are.
I am assured that this penalty is seldom
inflicted, and then only for the mpst serious
of offences. But that, to my mind, is not a
complete answer. The penalty can be imposed for any of the things I have indicated.
Moreover, in civil life, when a man has been
sent to jail and has served his term, we do
everything possible to terminate the penalty
with the completion of the term of imprisonment. To use a common phrase, he has then
paid his debt to society. A man convicted of
manslaughter, and in some circumstances
even of murder, may serve a term and be
discharged, and he is then not debarred
from all service in civil life which may be
in the interests of His Majesty. I do not
see why, in connection with military matters,
it is necessary to treat an offender with this

extreme harshness.

SENATE
I might go on to comment on a good many
other sections. The bill is a well-studied
piece of legislation. It was subjected last
session to scrutiny by a committee of this
house of which I had the honour to be a
member, and which held many meetings. In
general, I like the bill. ' wish, however, it
did not contain the two or three flaws-for
such I deem them to be-that I have felt it
my duty to point out. But it is not to be
supposed that I am condemning the bill. I
am not; and I hope that in due season amendments will be introduced to cover the points
I have mentioned.
May I, in conclusion, express my appreciation to the leader for having allowed the
bill to stand until I was able to attend.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

I will ask that the bill be not proceeded with

The Hon. the Speaker: The order stands.
DÉFENCE SUPPLIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 302, an Act respecting
Defence Supplies and Projects.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
would replace the present Department of
Munitions and Supply Act, which was originally passed in 1939 to meet the immediate
emergency that arose from the declaration of
war. The Act served its purpose well, both
during the war and after; but it was designed
to deal with a state of war and the immediate aftermath of war. It is now considered
advisable to replace it with legislation which
will be more nearly suited to the conditions
of today.

Although we are presently at peace, we are
by no means free from the threat of aggression. Indeed, much of our national energy
must be devoted to meeting that threat, and
clearly this is no time to take any action
which would hamper the defence of this
country. With these considerations in mind,
this legislation was framed to safeguard the
interests of defence in the field of procurement of supplies.
The bill would grant the Minister of Trade
and Commerce the general authority to procure defence supplies, to stockpile strategic
materials, to construct defence projects, and
to let contracts for government shipbuilding
and ship repairing. It would also give to the
minister the power which may be necessary
to obtain the completion of defence contracts.
This government has always received the
closest co-operation from the industrial suppliers. Nevertheless, even with the best
co-operation, because of other commitments,
conditions may arise which will make it
impossible for suppliers to fulfil government
requests for materials. For this reason the
bill gives the minister power to obtain for
defence contracts priority over other contracts, and power to ensure delivery of
materials essential to the production of
defence supplies or the completion of defence
If the minister exercises this
projects.
authority to demand completion or fulfilment
of defence requirements, he must make payment at the fair market price. If the supplier concerned does not believe payment has
been made in accordance with this condition,
he may appeal to the Exchequer Court. In
case the minister's order makes it impossible
for the supplier to fulfil his obligations under
any other agreement, such failure will not be
a cause for action before the courts.
Before the minister enters into a contract
the approval of the Governor in Council
must be obtained, except: (a) where in the
minister's opinion the contract must be executed immediately in the interests of defence;
(b) where the estimated expenditure does not
exceed $15,000, and (c) where the estimated
expenditure does not exceed $50,000 in cases
where competitive tenders have been obtained
and the lowest tender accepted. The minister,
however, will report to the Governor in
Council contracts involving more than $5,000
which have been entered into without the
approval of the Governor in Council.
The minister is granted authority to enter
into contracts without calling for tenders,
as required under section 36 of the Public
Works Act, in four cases:
(1) Where the disclosure of the specifications would, in the opinion of the Minister

SENATE

I repeat that I am amazed at this proposal
to give so much power to one man. And
what particularly puzzles me-I say this
quite candidly-is that the proposal is made
in cold blood, by a Liberal administration,
when there is no war and when the best prophets say there will be none. There is no
more likelihood of war today than there was
in 1930. As a Westerner I was suspicious
in 1929 that we were going to have war with
Germany, and I will tell you why. It did
not take much brains to form the opinion.
In that year Germany placed a tax of about
$1.85 a bushel on the importation of wheat.
It was an outrageous tax, and it prevented
the entry of any wheat into that country
from abroad. What was the purpose behind
it? The German government wanted its own
people to grow grain so that when war came
they would not be starved out, as they had
been in the first war. That was before Hitler,
remember, but it was plain enough to anybody then that Germany was getting ready.
But, as I say, the best prophets today predict that there will be no war. I do not think
that there is any doubt that Russia is getting
ready; but whether there will be a war or
not is another question. Many things will
enter into the decision on that point. Here
in Canada we are a long distance away from
a possible enemy. We are told that he could
come down over the northern country, over
the Arctic Ocean and Alaska, and bomb us.
Well, Operation Sweetbrier, which was held
up in that country, did not amount to very
much: airplanes ran into all kinds of trouble
and could not contend against the cold. It
is to be remembered further that we live
alongside a nation which is preparing for
war, as we are.
I do not object to the $650 million that we
are spending on defence preparations this
year, because money is of no importance in
comparison with the lives of the men and
women who would have to take an active
part in hostilities. But I cannot understand
why the government brings down a bill like
this. I have already pointed out that when
my honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) asked the Minister of
National Defence how it was intended to raise
the army, air force and navy if war came, the
reply was that the government of the day
would decide that issue. All right; well and
good. But here is a bill, sponsored by another
minister, asking parliament to make one man
a dictator. Only a few of the powers given
to him are conditional upon his obtaining the
consent of the Governor in Council, whereas
everything he does under this measure
should have required that consent. In any
event, should it suddenly appear necessary

to give one man all this power to build up
stockpiles of materials, why could parliament not be called together and asked for
the authority? War is not going to come so
soon as to make it impossible to do that-it
could not come so soon as that. Besides, the
government already has power to buy all the
defence materials it wishes, and there is no
need for this measure. The minister can purchase copper, zinc, raw rubber and so on,
wherever the goods are available, and build
up stockpiles.
I repeat that I am utterly unable to understand how a government supported by
Liberals can bring in legislation of this kind
and ask parliament to pass it. If a Tory
government was in office, and I, as leader of
the Senate, moved the second reading of a
bill like this, my Liberal friends here would
get up and say, "The old Tory party is conspiring to give one man power to run the
country." But the Tory party, far from

house, about 186 are Liberals. Yet this bill
was passed there and sent over for the
approval of the Senate, where Liberals outnumber Conservatives about 6 to 1, and I
presume that Liberal members here will vote
for it. How can a Liberal who votes to give
one man the dictatorial powers provided for
in this bill face public opinion?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is not Liberalism we

have now, it is National Socialism.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is National Socialism with
a bang.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is my honourable friend
intimating that dictatorial powers reside in
the Tory party?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, but that is what you
would say if the Tory party were in power
and brought down a bill like this. My honourable friend 'from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) would be one of the gentleman who
would get up and say, "The Tory party is
placing dictatorial power in one man's
hands."
Hon. Mr. Euler: Do you mean that that is
to be expected from the Conservative party?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, but you would say that
it was only what you expected from that
party. But for forty or fifty years I have
listened to talk-or perhaps it was twaddleabout Liberals being free traders and
believers in democracy, and I never thought
I should hear it stated in a legislative hall that
they supported legislation of this kind. Even
yet I cannot believe that in the secret recesses
of their minds the honourable gentlemen

JUNE 20, 1950
from Churchill and Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Crerar and Hon. Mr. Euler), for whose judigment I have a high regard, are not opposed
to this measure. I am unable to picture these
two gentlemen of long parliamentary experience-and others whom I could name-as
voting for the bill. I really do not know what
could get into such men to make them do
anything like that.
In my objection to the bill I have nothing
personal against anyone. Some people have,
but not I. I am opposed to it because its
underlying principle is inconsistent with parliamentary government. The parliamentary
system is being challenged tod'ay in Britain,
the United States and Canada. We in this
country are drifting away from parliamentary
control of the government. I think that we
are heading towardis a development such as
they have in Britain, by which the Prime
Minister becomes too powerful. He controls
his cabinet, for he appoints the members, and
anyone who happens to incur his dislike must
get out. And all the time the tendency is for
more and more power to accrue to the government.
The other day I read a newspaper account
of the by-election campaign in a Nova Scotia
constituency, and it was said that the people
were told, "You ought to elect the government supporter, because you may needi something; and the government, being in power,
can give it to you." That is the kind of thing
which goes on. And this very bill before
us seeks to add to the power of a minister.
If the bill is passed, he will not need to call
for tenders before making purchases or ordering the erection of buildings. There will be
no restriction at all on anything that he may
do within the limits of the bill; he will not
even need to submit his ideas to the cabinet
for approval.
I am opposed to this kind of legislation.
There may be some demand for it, but I
doubt it. Some may say that we were not
properly prepared for the second World
War, though we had the experience of the
previous war of 1914-18.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: We do not want a repetition of our experiences.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Following the first World
War the Liberal party was in power almost
continuously from 1921 to 1930, and in all
those years they never proposed legislation of
this character; and the Conservative government, which was in power from 1930 to 1935,
did not choose to propose this kind of legislation, although it must have known that the
threat of war then was just as great as it is
now, perhaps greater. I think there was much
more likelihood of Germany-and I do not

mean the German people-going to war under
the dictator Hitler in the years before 1939,
than there is of Russia declaring war today.
After observing the representatives of the
Soviet at the United Nations for a period of
two and a half months, I came to the
conclusion that I could not believe a word
they said and that they could not be trusted
at all. The Russians have, however, a native
ability to know their own limitations, and I
say that they will never go to war unless they
believe, beyond a shadow of doubt, that they
can win. The experience of Germany, first
in the war of 1914-18 and later in war of
1939-45, has had a sobering effect on the
Russian powers that be. They have seen how
free men and women can rise up, prepare for
and fight a war. I wish to say no more on
that phase of the subject.
I am personally shocked at the government
introducing this kind of legislation in this
day and age, when parliament can be called
together and, within a week, pass whatever
legislation is necessary. In asking for the
power to vote war supplies, we must not forget that in the future we will need a system
under which men and women can be raised
in the event of war. That is a more difficult
problem. After all, though our equipment
may be the most efficient and modern that
money can provide, it is still the aviator, the
gunner, the sailor and the tank driver-the
man behind the gun-who wil give us
strength to win a war.
Such legislation as this leads to dictatorship. Certainly it is bad in principle for a
democracy. This bill does not provide for the
calling of tenders on any project, but gives
the minister full power to go ahead on his
own. I am therefore oppçsed to the bill. In
my opinion the passage of this legislation by
parliament will be a backward step.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: By any process of
reasoning, honourable senators, this bill is an
extraordinary measure to ask a peace-time
parliament to pass. The Munitions and Supply
Act, which was passed in a war crisis, quite
properly gave to the appropriate minister
extraordinary powers for the purpose of
enabling him to procure the instruments of
war.
It may be, as the leader said in his opening
remarks, that this bill does not give to the
minister the powers which the Munitions and
Supply Act gave. I have read the bill rather
hurriedly, but at the moment I do not know
what power, if any, it fails to give. I repeat
that the Munitions and Supply Act was passed
in the heat of war, and conferred extraordinary-even dictatorial-powers on a minister
to procure the necessary munitions of war.

SENATE
We are now in times of peace. If there
was a likelihood that we would face war
within a few months, I could understand the
advisability of placing in the hands of the
Minister of Trade and Commerce such extraordinary powers. If everything pointed to an
outbreak of war in the near future, there
would be good reason for preparation and for
such a measure as this. But from what we
read in the press and hear from public men
in our own country and abroad, we are led
to believe that the danger of war with the
only possible aggressor, Russia, is less today
than it was a year ago.
Any person who reads and analyses section
3 of the bill can only reach the conclusion that
it places extraordinary powers in the hands
of the Minister of Trade and Commerce. Now,
he is an old friend and a former colleague of
mine; we marched together in the bitter days
of the war, and no one knows better than I do
his capacity for efficiently handling wartime
tasks, notwithstanding the criticisms that
were from time to time directed at his administration. But I come back to the position
that in peacetime I am opposed to the concentration of power in the hands of any
individual. If parliament fails to criticise and
restrain legislation of this character, undoubtedly the institution of parliament will fall into
disrepute. Parliament is composed of representatives of the people of Canada from the
Atlantic to the Pacifie, and in these halls we
use our collective judgment on behalf of the
people to consider legislation, to protect their
liberties and to perform the functions of government in the way that they would perform
them if they were here to do it for themselves.
I feel, therefore, that the responsibilities resting upon the shoulders of the men who compose our parliament are very great indeed.
I would repeat, that no one dislikes more
than I to offer criticism of a measure of this
kind. But my view is that to grant extraordinary powers to a minister of the Crown
in peacetime may have the effect of causing
us to slip further towards the position in
which delegated power is paramount. This
is the problem of every country with a democratic form of government today. As a result
of increased power being placed in the hands
of the executive there is a decline of confidence, not only in the legislation that parliament enacts but in the position it occupies in
the estimation of the people who elect representatives to it. Frankly, I cannot look on these
trends without some apprehension. I wish,
therefore, to register my objection to this
legislation and to the results that may, in
future years, flow from it.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I stand second to no one in this chamber
or anywhere else in matters of liberalism and

democracy or in my respect for parliament and
my desire that the business of this country be
carried on in a democratie and reasonable
way. And yet I do not feel shocked by this
bill in the way that it shocks the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), or my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
Like most of the other members of this house,
I have been through at least two great wars,
in which the ordinary rights of the citizen
were overridden in the roughest manner. I
have seen powers of government exercised
over the individual. I have seen boys taken
from their schools and their homes and put
in the army and sent overseas where many lost
their lives. The leader of the opposition says
that money is nothing compared with life. I do
not quote him verbatim, but I think he will
agree that that is the substance of his statement. In other words, that considerations
which affect life are vastly more important
than those which apply to money; the two are
not to be counted in the same class.
My friend says that the government should
announce how we are going to get men for
our armies in the next war; that as a matter
of democracy the government should tell us
what they are going to do. I assume that he
means that the government should now
declare whether, if another war should occur,
we shall have conscription. It seems to me
that the proper and democratie course is the
one taken by the government when it says
that this question will be decided by those
who are in authority at that time; that we,
not knowing the situation we shall then have
to meet, should not bind their hands in
advance. Speaking neither as a prophet nor
with any special knowledge, I suppose the
probabilities are that if we go into a third
world war there will be no voluntary enlistment; it will be conscription from the drop
of the hat.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Of everything.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And everybody.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: And everything.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Probably everything as
well. In the last war the leader of the opposition was, I believe, an enthusiastic advocate
of conscription. I never was. I always disliked it; and in the earlier stage of its application I felt that we were sacrificing the
principles of the British army, which had
always depended on voluntary enlistment, to
adopt the evil traditions of continental Europe
with its conscript armies. But as time went
on and the necessity presented itself, I could
not but come to the conclusion that we, too,
must be more orderly in the matter of enlistments: and I have no doubt at all that our
participation in a third war will be on the
basis of conscripting our young men, whether

you or I like it or not. With that proposal,
I fancy the leader of the opposition would be
in entire accord. He will be in favour of
conscription.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never said that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think he will be.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, you have no right to
say that. I never said so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very well; then I withdraw the statement. I thought in that regard
he was like the rest of his party.
Mr. Haig: I did not say so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I sat in the House of
Commons week after week, month after
month, and heard them proclaiming there the
virtues of conscription and attacking voluntary enlistment, and doing everything possible
to make voluntary enlistment unsuccessful.

open, active and ready, and other such purposes as the leader has mentioned can be
achieved at the cost only of money, and of
money which when spent must be accounted
for, I fail to be shocked at this. I yield to
nobody in my desire for the democratic
handling of our business, in my love of
liberalism in its broadest sense; but I believe
that if democracy is to succeed it must
demonstrate its ability to meet a crisis and
prove that it is as efficient as, and even
more efficient than, other forms of government.
In order for democracy to function effectively, it must have good officials who can
be trusted to carry out their duties honestly
and successfully. We were very fortunate
in the last war. The Department of Munitions
and Supply was given much wider powers
than are contained in this bill, and the
officials who will head the department under
this legislation will be the same as those
who during the last war effectively spent
millions upon millions of dollars-I shall not
say without a dollar being purloined, but
practically without corruption. One of the real
factors in the winning of that war was the
rapid conversion of our industries to war
production; and if these officials I have
mentioned require authority to enable them
to be better prepared for the next war than
we were for the last, I cannot be shocked by
their request. Thus it is that I propose to
vote for this bill.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators, I
had not intended to enter into this debate,
but I wish to point out that the discussion
has strayed far from the subject of the bill
and from the point which my leader (Hon.
Mr. Haig) endeavoured to make as to our
attitude towards the legislation.
In time of war or in time of emergency
we on this side would be the last ones to
oppose the government in taking necessary
powers. We supported the government during the last war when it had to adopt emergency measures; we did not quibble about it.
But what we are objecting to now is the
placing of full power in the hands of one
man in peacetime. While honourable senators were speaking about dictatorship I
was reminded of a verse which is familiar to
us all from our schooldays. It runs like this:
Vice is a inonster of so frightful mien,
As to be hated needs but to be seen;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
I think that if the word dictatorship were
substituted for the word vice we would have
a perfect illustration of what is happening in
our parliament today. A few years ago it would
have been unthinkable to have introduced a
bill such as this, entrusting all these powers
to the hands of one man when there is no

emergency. But gradually, step by step, the
powers of parliament have been given into
the hands of the government, into the hands
of the cabinet, and now, apparently, into the
hands of one man. As reported in the press
when the debate on this question was in progress in the other house,
dictatorship and a very

ardent supporter of
and of the Minister
said, "Well, after all,

it is good dictatorship".
It seems, honourable senators, that "We
first endure, then pity, then embrace". How
much further down the road shall we go until
we embrace dictatorship?
It seems to me
that the lines are pretty finely drawn when
a supporter of the present government when
referring to this bill admits that it practically involves dictatorship, but claims that it
is good dictatorship.
Honourable senators, I am opposed to dictatorship, whether it is so-called good dictatorship; or not; and so I am opposed to this
bill.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. Gordon Fogo: Hoiourable senators,
I should like to make it clear that the right
to dislike dictatorship is not confined to any
side of this or any other house. I regret that
those responsible for preparing this bill did
not sec fit to print along with it the provisions
of the existing legislation, the Munitions and
Supply Act. Had I a copy of this Act at
hand, I would read some excerpts from it to
illustrate to the house that its provisions are
far more drastic and all-embracing than
those of the present legislation, and that the
Act which is now on the statute books does
not contain the provisions which appear in
this bill.
There may be vast differences of opinion
as to whether or not there will be another
war and as to how one should best prepare

are dealing with something different. We
are dealing with a reduction rather than an
increase in power, and we should keep this
fact in mind when considering the bill now

reputation of disliking any law which encourages war and any legislation which is undemocratic and which invests power in a small
group or an individual rather than in the
majority. This is especially so if the person
rising to speak is of Liberal allegiance.

JUNE 20, 1950
I am doubtful of the accuracy of the assertion of the honourable member from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis), that since the
end of the second World War we in this
country have been at peace. I am not sure
that we are not still at war. At any rate
we are certainly war-minded, and so much so
that the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) finds it logical that Canada should
spend $600,000 millionsHon. Mr. Haig: $650 million.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Yes, $650 million on
defence. He finds that quite natural, and I
do not blame him.
Hon. Mr. Fafard: God bless you!
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Some honourable member
has said "God bless you." I hope that our
GÔd will bless those people of the world who
want peace, and help the warmongers to
become peaceful people so that the threat of
war will not hang over our heads. But as I
say, honourable senators, we are at war, in
theory at least. It is now a "cold" war.
My honourable friend the distinguished
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) says
that if the Tories were in power and brought
in a bill like this the Liberals would rise up
and denounce it. I suppose he recalls the
days of the first Great War, when his party
was in office. May I say to him, "Other
times, other means." The war of 1914-1918
was in many respects fought as wars had
been fought for centuries. It was a war of
guns against guns, of soldiers beating back
other soldiers from one trench to another.
In comparison with what will happen if
there is another war, that was a kind of
sporting event. In former days countries
began hostilities only after declaring war.
But surely everybody knows that the next
war will not be preceded by any declaration.
No time will be given to any parliament to
assemble and pass laws for national defence.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: The outbreak of the next
war may be announced to Canadians by the
dropping of an atomic bomb on these parliament buildings.
The honourable leader opposite said he
did not place any reliance upon the people
whom many suspect will be our next
enemies. I do not blame him at all, for one
cannot rely upon what they say. Although
they talk peace, although they contend that
only the capitalist powers are preparing for
war, we know very well in our hearts and
souls which side is preparing for war and
in the meantime is doing its utmost to stir
up prejudice and misunderstanding among
the nations. One has only to listen to the

radio or read the papers to discover, if he
does not know already, that Russia is doing
her best to incite the democratic countries
into declaring war against her. She is ready,
and she will probably begin her attack, as
the Japanese did against Pearl Harbor in
1941, without a declaration of war.
So although I stand for liberty, although I
am a humble member of a group in this
country who dislike war, yet because I love
my children and my country, and because
as a member of this chamber I have a duty
to help Canada to survive, I am ready ta
surrender all my right to freedom and democratic procedure and even to place great
power in the hands of only one man,
especially when I know that that man is
able so to serve Canada effectively. If war
should ever be declared-which God forbid
-by
the dropping of a bomb upon these
buildings, or elsewhere in this country, we
shall be ready; we shall not be bound to
wait for parliament to be called to legislate
for our defence.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I would not rise to take part in this debate
had it not been that a great part of the
speech by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) had nothing
at all to do with the bill, and had he not
gone out of his way to make the untrue and
foul statement that in the last war the
Conservative party had done its best ta
prevent volunteer enlistment. No baser lie
was ever uttered any-where. And certainly
no one could give greater comfort to the
enemy than by making an accusation of that
kind. While he has said some things with
which I have agreed, he is one of the most
impractical speakers in this chamber. But
I thought that at least he was a gentleman
and would withdraw the remark he made,
for it is untrue and can be proven so.
It has already been stated by the leader
on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) that in committee on the National Defence Bill I asked
the minister how members of the forces
would be enlisted in the event of war. In
my opinion the method which the government intends to adopt should have been one
of the first matters provided for in that bill.
I complained of the so-called volunteer
method that was used in this country. If a
young fellow's parents had a home where he
could reside, and were able to find employment for him, he was fortunate; but I pitied
others. If of military age and unable to produce a certificate of unfitness for military
service, they could not obtain employment,.
and the schools and universities were closed.

SENATE

to them. I think that a call-up system as
used by other members of the Atlantic Pact
countries is fairer.
The honourable member from Toronto
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has slandered the
Conservative party. Although I belong to
that party I spoke on many occasions during
the last war on behalf of the Liberal party.
I remember that at one meeting in northern
Saskatchewan the local Liberal member
refused to appear on the platform, and when
someone in the audience asked a question
about the government's policy and what the
Liberal party was doing, the chairman said,
"Senator Horner is defending the Liberal
party and will answer your question."
Because I did what I could to assist the government in every way during the war, I personally resent the honourable gentleman's
remarks about my party; and now that I find
he is not gentleman enough to withdraw his
slander against the party, I will never listen
to another speech that he makes in this
chamber.
Some Hon. Senators: Order.

The Hon. the Speaker: I would ask the
honourable senator to withdraw his remark
insinuating that the honourable senator from
Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is not a
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I will withdraw it if he
withdraws the slander he made against my
party, but not until then.
The Hon. the Speaker: What was said by
the honourable gentleman from Toronto
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) was said about
a party, but the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) was directed against another senator. That is the difference between the two
statements.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I did not catch Your
Honour's last remark.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is the Senate ready

moved

the second

reading of Bill 310, an Act to authorize the
provision of moneys to meet certain capital
expenditures made and capital indebtedness
incurred by the Canadian National Railways
System during the calendar year 1950, and
to authorize the guarantee by His Majesty
of certain securities to be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
to provide capital funds for the Canadian
National Railways for the current year, in
the total net amount of $24,582,489. The bill
is in the same form as one which parliament
has passed annually for a considerable time,
and I do not think it is necessary for me to
go into great detail in explaining the measure. It permits of the issue by the Canadian
National Railways, and the guarantee by the
government, of securities to the amount that
I mentioned. It also authorizes the Minister
of Finance, pending the issue and sale of
such securities to the public, temporarily to
advance moneys to the Canadian National
Railways for the purpose of meeting capital
expenditures. The details with respect to
capital expenditure are itemized in section 2
of the bill.
Sections 9 and 10 deal with the annual
deficits which may result from the current
operations of the National Railways System
and the Trans-Canada Airlines. These sections permit the Minister of Finance to
advance to the Canadian National Railways
and to the Trans-Canada Airlines respectively, on a temporary basis, such sums as

JUNE 20, 1950
may be needed to meet those deficits, pending
the voting by parliament of the moneys in
the ordinary way.
I do not think any further explanation of
the bill is necessary. With respect to its
further progress through the house, it may
well be that some honourable senators may
wish to have it referred to a standing committee. Our practice in past years has been
to refer similar bills to committee, where the
officials of the Canadian National Railways
have appeared to give detailed information
of proposed capital expenditures, and to
answer any questions which honourable senators wished to ask with reference to the
operation of the railway system. If it is the
desire of honourable senators to follow that
procedure, when the bill has been given
second reading I shall be glad to move that it
be referred to the appropriate standing
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not intend to speak on
the bill, provided the honourable member will
assure me that it will be referred to a

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CANADIAN TRADE
RELATIONS

Hon. W. D. Euler presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations, to whom were referred certain
estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, may I suggest, if it is in order to do so, that it would
help members to understand this report and
others that will be presented-there are quite
a number of them-if they were printed in
Hansard as well as in the Minutes of
Proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, it
occurs to me that instead of printing the
report in today's Hansard it would be better

to postpone the printing until the day when
the report is to be debated. Then the debate
could begin with the report. I think it would
be better to have the report printed in our
Debates. It would of course be automatically
printed in the Minutes of Proceedings; but
if it appeared in the Debates, preceding
the report, anyone reading Hansard would
get the whole picture.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But it would be of no
assistance unless it appeared tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It will be printed in the
Minutes of Proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That may be so, but that
publication is not read as closely as Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am agreeable to either
procedure.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant,
as follows:
Wednesday, June 21, 1950
The Standing Committee on Canadian Trade Relations, to whom was referred certain Estimates laid
before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1951, beg leave to report as follows:
(1) That in order to get an-overall picture of the
cost of defence items like that of Canadian Arsenals
Limited, $2,900,000, special item 447, $900,000, should
be in the estimates of the Department of National
Defence.
(2) That if an estimate for arsenals remains in
those of the Department of Trade and Commerce,
offsetting items should be shown together with the
estimate.
(3) That the item of $1,600,000, for development
of jet engines and aircraft should be listed with the
estimates of the National Research Council.
(4) That services producing revenue, such as the
operation of the Grain Act, inspection and weighing
of grain, as well as those of the Wheat Board Act,
should be made as nearly self-sustaining as possible
and that the estimates be made to show the respective amounts of income in connection with these
services.
(5) That in the payment of various subsidies from
the federal treasury every effort should be made to
continue the policy of reducing such subsidies, both
in amount and number and that they be discontinued entirely, except in cases of great urgency.
(6) That every item in the estimates part of which
deals with matters of National Defence in any of
its branches, should be in the estimates of the
Department of National Defence, so that the total
cost of defence be clearly shown in National
Defence estimates.
(7) That wherever the amount included in any
estimate is for assistance to aerial navigation the
footnote should state whether Trans-Canada Air
Lines is to receive full benefit, or whether private
air lines will share in them. It should also indicate
the nature of aid allotted to air line companies,
that is whether such aid will be solely to better
means of navigation, or will provide methods to
lower general costs of operation.
(8) When attached to estimates covering salaries
and expenses of trade representatives in foreign
countries, there should be a footnote giving the
naines of the countries in which our trade representatives whose salaries and expenses are paid
entirely by the Department of Trade and Commerce.

JUNE 21, 1950
(9) That since trade with the West Indies has for
many years been of major importance to the economy of the Maritime Provinces, especially with
regard to the fisheries and Merchant Marine and
since the salt and canned fish market in the British
West Indies is much impaired by arbitrary and
prohibitory measures and non-convertible currency
every effort should be made to remove these difficulties and to restore this trade, as well as to
promote trade in manufactured goods; and further
that efforts should be made to effect reciprocal trade
with Cuba, the Dominican Republie, Venezuela and
other South and Central American countries.
The committee records its appreciation of the
willing and valuable assistance given it by the
executives of the Department of Trade and Commerce in our examination of the estimates.

would force the board to take action early
in the crop year to protect the market for
western Canada grain, and that any action
requiring the operators of eastern and
terminal elevators to reserve storage capacity that ultimately might not be necessary,
might prove to be unfair. Under the clause
in the bill as drawn, grain would be admitted
to such elevators on condition that the elevators would be cleared by the date when they
were required to handle the Canadian crop,
and by a more flexible regulation of the
trade, both Canadian shippers of wheat
and the elevator operators would be protected. In view of the advice which I have
obtained from the government, I on their
behalf must ask the Senate not to adopt
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
the amendment before us is not mine, nor
the consequence of some proposal of mine;
but as I have often spoken here on subjects
connected with grain I may be expected to
say something now. With respect, as a
matter of information to those who are not
westerners, may I outline the issue that is
involved? We define as "terminal" elevators
those elevators located at Vancouver, Port
Arthur and Fort William, and Churchill. On
the eastern side of the lakes and along the
St. Lawrence are what are known as "Bay
Port" elevators, which are used to store
grain received from the West and hold it for
shipment abroad. A considerable amount of
grain is also received from the United States
and held here for a time before it is moved
to the eastern seaboard. The storage business so received is very profitable. Figures
presented to the committee show that in good
years western Canadian wheat accounts for
about 60 per cent of the storage occupied,
and the balance is used for American wheat
or corn.
I turn now to the question of the bill before
us, and the amendment suggested by the
committee. Under the new section 133, subsection (la) as proposed by the bill the owner
of a bay elevator at, say, Collingwood, or elsewhere, is not permitted to take in any grain
of United States origin without a permit
from the Board of Grain Commissioners. The
bill provides that at the beginning of the season the board shall decide how much space
in these elevators is required for the storage of
Canadian grain, and that without the board's
permission none of that space can be occupied
by American grain. As between the bill and
the amendment the difference is hardly more
than that between tweedledum and tweedledee. Under the terms of the bill, the elevator owner must apply to the Board of Grain
Commissioners and advise them that storage

space is required for, say, a million bushels
of corn or wheat originating in the United
States. The commissioners, after deliberation,
may notify him that he can take in this million
bushels, but he must get it out by the first of
October, or November, or some other date
which they specify. Such a condition would
probably prevent the storage of any large
amount of grain from the United States. If,
however, the committee's amendment were
adopted what would happen. is this. Let us
say that at the beginning of the season the
estimate of Western Canada's wheat crop is
300 million bushels. Western grain which is
not used for local consumption or milling purposes is sent to the terminals at Fort William
and Vancouver, and they endeavour to ship
as much of it as possible to the Bay ports
before the winter freeze-up. The advantage of
this is that if, say, Rumania or Italy wish to
buy a million bushels of our surplus wheat,
it can quickly be sent to the seaboard to be
shipped overseas. On the other hand, if the
grain were kept in storage at Fort William,
much time and expense would be involved in
transporting it by rail to the ocean-going
vessels during the winter months.
At the start of the season the grain commissioners will inform each elevator operator
how much grain he will have to store for
Canadian purposes. Then, once he has reserved
this space he will be at liberty to rent the
rest of it as he sees fit.
In my opinion the members of the Board
of Grain Commissioners have a better opportunity than anybody else to judge what the
grain crop will be. For instance, if it is to be
500 million bushels, we shall need practically
all the storage space available in the Bay port
elevators; but if the crop is to be only 300
million bushels, we shall probably require only
50 per cent of the space, and the elevators will
be free to rent the rest of their accommodation.
Whichever amendment is adopted, the matter will be dealt with by the Board of Grain
Commissioners which is made up of independent men appointed by the government to
make rules and regulations for the handling of
grain. Heretofore this question has been under
the control of the Wheat Board, and the only
trouble has been that this body itself was a
dealer in grain, and there was a possibility of
conflict of interest. I am in favour of putting
this matter under the control of the Grain
Act, because I think it represents a fairer
arrangement to everyone concerned.
Honourable senators, when this amendment
was being discussed in committee the Minister of Agriculture did not say anything, and
the majority of members present voted in
favour of the amendment. I do not think it
will make any difference at all to the western
grain producers, because I am confident that

JUNE 21, 1950
the Board of Grain Commissioners will act
fairly towards them. The members of the
Board are nearly ail westerners anyway, and
they will be careful in handling this legisiation. Our elevators cannot operate on a paying basis if they have to take chances and are
flot able ta handie titis extra grain.
My honourable friends fromn Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseitine), and Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
are farmers, and are just as well or better
acquainted with the crop situation in Western
Canada than I arn, but it is my understanding
that crop conditions are only f air. Manitoba
is wet and Alberta is dry; southern Saskatchewan will have a reasonably good crop
while some places in northern Saskatchewan
will also have a good yieid. Ail in ail there
will flot be a surplus crop, and I think that 300
million bushels will be the top mark. Tihis
wiil certainiy not use up ail our storage
facilities.
Honourabie senators, I think we might try
the amendment for one year. If it does not
work, we will change it, because the people
of the West are more interested in grain than
in anything else. I do not think we wiil be
daing the administration of the Act any harm.
by adopting this amendment.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
in one sense at least I do not tbink there is a
great deal of difference between the amendment suggested by the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce and the original
amendment proposed in the bill. I was one
of a fairly substantial mai ority in cammittee
wha voted in favour of the amendment contained in the report. I stiil adhere ta that
position, and regret that 1 differ fromn my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) in titis
respect.
May I give the house my view as to just
exactly what is involved in this controversy?
For many years, as was explained in committee, these bay elevators have been accepting American grain for storage when the
space was not needed for the Canadian crop.
At no time has there ever been a shortage
of accommodation in these elevators for Canadian grain shipped fromn the head of the
lakes. Last year, however, a rather special
circumstance arose because of an enormous
American crop and a considerable shortage of
storage space in that country. Early last
season, before the Canadian crop was ready,
these bay port elevators began to fil up with
American grain, which of course was earning
valuable American dollars for this country.
The Board of Grain Commissioners were
afraid that if this practice continued there
would not be enough space for the Canadian
grain when it camne down from. the head of

the lakes, sa, although they had no statutory
authorîty ta do sa, they prevailed upon
operators of these grain elevators ta stop
acýcepting the American grain and to reserve
sufficient space for the anticipated Canadian
crop.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They prevailed on these
people through the Customs Department.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. The purpose of
the present bill is to ensure that the Board of
Grain Commissioners, should this condition
ever arise again, will have the statutory
authority to do what they did last year without authority. I think we are ail agreed that
in case of a shortage of storage capacity in
these elevators, aur law should provide that
aur own grain be given preference over that
from. the United States.
The question here is really one of form,
and I should like ta ask the Senate how the
average man, faced with this problem, would
go about changing the present Act in order
ta give the Board of Grain Cammissioners the
power which it seeks.
The amendment
adopted by the Banking and Commerce Committee did that thing in, it seems to me, the
ordinary business way. Titis is the amendment whic.h the cammittee approved:
The Board-

That is, the Board of Grain Commissioners.
-may require any operator
or an eastern elevator to
storage in the publie space
grain grown autside Canada
out of Canada.

of a terminal elevatar
refuse to receive for
of such elevator any
in transit for shipment

We were advised by aur counsel, and I do
flot think it was disputed by the minister or
by anyone else, that that clause would give
the Board of Grain Commissioners ample
power ta, do what it did in the exceptianal
circumstances of last year, if they should ever
occur again.
But the original clause which we were
asked ta approve was something very
different. This is how it reads in the bill:
No operator of a terminal elevatar or an eastern
elevator shail receive into such elevator for storage
in transit for reshipment out of Canada any grain
grown outside Canada unless he is first authorized
to do so by a regulation or order of the Board.

Hon. Mr. Turgeon: What section is that,
please?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is at the top of
page 3 of the bill. It is the proposed new
subsection (la) of Section 133 of the Act.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that
a mandatory provision of that kind is not
only totaily unnecessary but is, as it were,
a steam shovel being used ta crack a nut.
Unless it can be shown ta, be absalutely
necessary, 1 strangly abject ta the insertion

SENATE
in our law of a positive prohibition, such as
this, of an act of commerce which has taken
place time and again in the last fifty years.
As I say, I think the question is one of
form rather than of substance. When there
can be inserted in a bill a good provision
empowering the board to deal with exceptional circumstances of the kind that
occurred last year, I can see no reason for
the absolute prohibition contained in the bill.
I think a prohibition of that kind is a relic
of the mentality which so many of our civil
servants and boards developed during the
war, and which led them to recommend that
statutes be amended to prevent anyone from
doing this, that or the other thing, without
their permission. To my mind that is really
the only point of substance in the amendment. I think that in practice it will not
make a great deal of difference whether we
adopt the original clause in the bill or the
one proposed by the committee. In either
case the Board of Grain Commissioners will
have statutory power to deal with an unusual
condition of affairs such as arose last year.
But in my opinion we should not, unless
really necessary, insert in the Act a clause
absolutely prohibiting elevator operators from
continuing a well-established practice of the
grain trade.
Hon. Mr. McGuire: And there is no provision for compensation to the elevator
operators.
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators,
as I moved the amendment in the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, I should like to
say a few words about it here. First I wish
to thank the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) for permitting this order to stand
until today, so that I might be present.
The honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has made a very clear
and concise analysis of the effect of the proposed new section. In moving the amendment I was not seeking to have anything
taken away from the substance of that secHaving had some experience and
tion.
knowledge of the workings of the Board of
Grain Commissioners, I can say that the
board has functioned extremely well; that its
administration in connection with elevators
and the transportation and handling of grain
in Canada has been most efficient at all times.
Never in the past has the board had to resort
to a directive such as authorized in the bill.
Co-operation between the board and the ele.
vators has always been on the highest level.
The board has always had jurisdiction over
elevators. The Grain Act, which constitutes
the board, empowers it to license elevators
annually, and in licensing them it has been
the Board's practice to set aside in particular

locations, such as in the Bay ports-that is on
Georgian Bay and Lake Huron-a percentage
of the elevator space for private use and a
percentage for public use. That has been
done for the purpose of assuring at all times
sufficient space for the handling of grain
coming from Western Canada. In the past
fifty years there never has been any difficulty,
and I cannot see that there will be any in the
future.
Many of these elevators located at the Bay
ports have always had to depend to a large
extent for their earnings on the movement
of grain from the United States, from Lake
Michigan ports to the Bay ports and then
through the New England States. That movement often takes place earlier in the year
than the movement of Western grain. It is
true that occasionally grain comes in for storage from American ports as well as from
Canadian ports, but the evidence submitted
by the trade when this matter was under
discussion indicated quite clearly that there
was always space available in these elevators.
I should like to draw the attention of the
Senate to the general scheme of legislation
contained in the Canada Grain Act. In effect
it constitutes the board of Grain Commissioners and vests that board with jurisdiction
to pass regulations from time to time affecting
the storage and handling of grain. This Bill
249 would extend the board's powers, by
authorizing it to pass regulations on a new
subject-matter. Permit me to read section 1,
which sets out this new subject-matter:
Governing the receipt at eastern elevators and at
terminal elevators, for storage in transit for reshipment out of Canada, of grain grown outside Canada,
in order to ensure priority of storage for grain
grown in Canada, and specifying the period of time
that such grain grown outside Canada may remain
in storage at such elevators.

I submit, honourable senators, that that
power is in itself broad enough to enable the
board to make any regulations necessary to
ensure priority of adequate storage space
for Canadian grain in these elevators. Admittedly, judging from the experience of the
past, that wide power and authority-if the
government thinks that the Board of Grain
Commissioners should have it-will be exercised in a proper way. But by subsection
(la) of section 133(1) of the Act, as contained
in clause 6 of the bill, the government has
proposed a prohibitory measure. It reads:
No operator of a terminal elevator or an eastern
elevator shall receive into such elevator for storage
in transit for reshipment out of Canada any grain
grown outside Canada unless he is first authorized
to do so by a regulation or order of the board.

In effect, that clause seems to say that even
if these elevators were empty, and no one was
paying for that space, that the operators can
never use it as they have in the past until
they go to the Board of Grain Commissioners

JUNE 21, 1950
and get a permit or an order entitling them
to do so. I submit that in the circumstances
this type of legislation is not necessary and
should not be put on our statute books.
I do not for a moment suggest that in the
event of an emergency the board should not
have the authority to request or require the
elevators to keep certain space available. I
proposed the amendment because it seemed
to me to improve the language of the clause
and bring it more within the general scheme
of the Canada Grain Act.
At the risk of repetition I, should like to
read again the amendment proposed by the
committee:
The board may require any operator of a terminal
elevator or an eastern elevator to refuse to receive
for storage in the public space of such elevator any
grain grown outside Canada in transit for shipment
out of Canada.
In other words, the Board of Grain Commissioners may at any time issue an order
to elevator operators to the effect that without
a permit they may not accept any more
grain. The trade is quite satisfied that such
an order will not be issued unless an
emergency arises. But there is considerable
difference between the board having authority
to take positive action, and the passage of
a statute providing that no operator may
accept grain without the authority of the
board.
The honourable leader has saiçl that there
is some fear on the part of the government
that elevator owners and operators might be
subjected to rigid orders under the proposed
amendment. The representatives of the trade
who were heard before the committee strongly
supported the amendment, and gave their
reasons for so doing.
It seerns to me that this honourable body
has performed a great service to the country
in setting up committees-particularly the
Banking and Commerce committee-which
provide interested parties with an opportunity
to present their views on proposed legislation.
Those who have appeared before the committee of this house have been pleased with
the reception they received, and impressed
with the efforts of members of committees
to give effect to the purpose of the legislation and so far as possible, comply with
the reasonable requests of interested persons. I believe that one of the functions
of the Senate is to provide-as well as a
place for sober second thought-committees
where informed and interested persons may
come and state their views.
I heartily support the amendment, because
I feel that it does not in any way affect
the subject matter of the bill as introduced;

in fact, I believe it is an improvement in
form and carries through the general scheme
of the Act.
Hon. J. W. Stambaugh: Honourable senators,
I was not in the committee when this bill was
discussed, but as I understand the proposed
amendment it asks the board to declare at the
beginning of the season the amount of space
that may be required.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Not just at the beginning of the season, but at any time.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Suppose an elevator
company made a contract with the United
States, or any other foreign country, to
fill all available space with foreign grain.
Under those circumstances the Board of Grain
Commissioners could not do anything about
it, and in any event it would be difficult
to go back on the contract.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: There has never been a
.crisis in this country such as my friend
suggests, and there is not likely to be.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: That may be true,
but the United States is experiencing something near to a crisis now, with millions of
bushels of grain in storage and no more
space available. I understand that they will
soon be looking to Canada for storage facilities.
I would prefer that the board be given
authority as originally provided, for the bill;
therefore I must oppose the amendment.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: My honourable friend
from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) has
evidently overlooked the fact that the amendment does not bar the Board of Grain Commissioners from acting in an emergency of the
kind he suggests.
In earlier, and I am bound to say somewhat happier days, before we became involved with regulationsHon. Mr. Lambert: And wheat boards.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and
wheat boards,
American grain moved freely through our
Bay ports, and as a result about a dozen
companies built elevators to a capacity of
32 million bushels for the receiving and
handling of Canadian grain and some
American grain. At least one of those
elevators was built with American capital for
the purpose of handling American grains.
Under the old dispensation the grain moved
freely, and an elevator at Port Colborne for
instance, could arrange by letter, telegraph, or
even by telephone, to accept American corn
from Chicago or perhaps coarse grains from
Duluth. The grain was taken into the
elevator, held for the order of the consignor,
and the elevator company collected its storage
and handling charges.

SENATE
A few years ago a change was made in
that procedure by reason of the fact that
the Wheat Board was given the power to
prohibit the importation of the grains it
was dealing in from the United States. I
believe I am correct-and the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell)
will correct me if I am wrong-that that
Conprohibition did not include corn.
sequently some corn came in from the
United States and occupied space in these
elevators.
Now, as regards this proposal. In earlier
years grain moved freely. The amendment of
the Canada Grain Act, which the committee
considered definitely prohibited eastern elevator owners from taking in grain from outside of Canada, unless the approval of the
Board of Grain Commissioners had been first
obtained. As I understand the committee's
amendment, operators would be permitted to
accept grain from abroad unless an emergency
should arise, or in the judgment of the Board
of Grain Commissioners an emergency might
arise, whereby this space would be needed for
in that event the board
Canadian grain:
could veto the acceptance of American grain.
The difference between the amendment and
what is proposed in the bill is one of degree;
it is a difference of form. I agree largely
with what the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) said. Under
the amendment in the bill, the Board of Grain
Commissioners, if they saw fit, could issue a
decree that no American grain should be
taken into these elevators, say in the crop
year beginning August 1, 1950. Much depends
on the manner in which the board administers
this new responsibility. But I object in
principle to requiring citizens of Canada, the
owners of these eastern elevators, to go hat
in hand to get a permit before they can do
the business which they were organized to do.
I therefore support the committee's amendment. Only in the event of an emergency
should the board have the power to act; and
the necessary protection to the public interest would be contained in that power. While
I am willing to clothe the board with the necessary discretionary powers, I do not approve
of conceding them, to begin with, absolute
powers, and requiring the operator of an
eastern elevator to go to them in order to
receive permission to do something which he
has always been able to do.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Since I entered parliament, some thirty-three years ago, I have
received many shocks, and on various occasions I have been so scandalized by legislation introduced in parliament that such
sensitiveness as I had at the beginning has
been dulled or has largely disappeared. Yet I
cannot say that the bill before us does not

scandalize me: it does indeed to a great
degree. At our last party convention we
clamoured against bureaucratie systems of
government and boards, such as have been
created in the last few decades. On that score
we are at one with the opposition; at their
last national convention, the leaders of the
Conservative party spoke as eloquently as
ours, on the same subject and to the same
effect.
I address myself to this issue not as a Liberal or a Conservative, but as a democrat. I
have the highest regard for the Board of
Grain Commissioners collectively and for its
individual members. I believe that they discharge with great conscientiousnes what they
deem to be their duty to the public. But
they are human beings, and officials invested
with totalitarian power will use it; they will
naturally assume that if parliament gave it to
them it is to be used.
The bill before us concerns private institutions, Bay port elevators, created with private
capital. It is a fundamental principle of law,
public, civil or private law, that when, in the
public interest, something privately owned is
required, it shall be requisitioned and the
owner compensated. What"are we doing here?
We are telling private institutions that no
longer shall they be masters in their own
house, that they may no longer use their
property as they please.
I do not suggest that the board should be
deprived of the right ta requisition, in the
public interest, space in these eastern or other
elevators so as to give priority to Canadiangrown grain over foreign grain. But such
space, if and when required, should be paid
for. Evidence has been adduced before our
standing committee to the effect that the
board has sometimes reserved space which it
neither used nor paid for. That is scandalous,
a violation of that fundamental principle that
nobody should be compelled to give up his
private property without due and prior compensation, and then only when public interest so requires.
The amendment, in my opinion, is extremely
mild. Had I been instructed to draw it up,
I should have gone much further. In this
case I cannot accept the proposed legislation.
I am in favour of the committee's amendment,
and my only regret is that it does not go
further. The operators of the eastern elevators could very well say to the Board, "If
and when you require space we shall make it
available to you, but you shall pay for it".
That would be in keeping with the fundamental principles of law and democracy. I
am therefore strongly in favour of the amendment and shall vote for it.

JUNE 21, 1950
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I was not present in committee when this
amendment was discussed, and as I am not
engaged in the grain trade I am merely an
onlooker in this battle, and as such I must
confess that I am mystified.
Apparently the question before the house
bas to do with phraseology of two clauses,
one which is already incorporated in the bill,
and the other having been suggested by the
Banking and Commerce Committee. While
my feelings about government officials interfering in private business are the same as
those of the honourable senator from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) I must say that this
Is not the issue before the house. We are
debating the merits of one method of grovernment control as compared to another; and
apparently whichever way we vote there will
be gov.ernment supervision of the storage
space in these grain elevators.
What troubles me is all the boiling that
seems to be going on in the tea pot. So far
as I can ascertain-and I wish the senior senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbeil) would
correct me if I am wrong-the question is
whether the elevator operators shall go to the
officials of the board and ask permission to
store American grain, or whether the officials
of the board shall go to the elevator operators
and tell them what they must do. That is
the question, is it not? What I cannot understand is why those who ostensibly are on the
side of the elevator operators object to going
to the board for permission. As I have said,
I am not interested in this problem either as
a member of the committee or one who is
engaged in the grain trade; but is it not possible that when the board wakes up to the
fact that there is a crisis the elevators will be
full?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is possible.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Not full, but partly so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I should like to be sure
about this point. I should really like to hear
again from the government leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) why the department deems it
necessary that the elevator operators should
seek permission from government officials in
order to store American grain.
We in this house are apparently agreed that
government supervision is required to ensure
the preserving of space for Canadian grain
in the Bay port elevators. This being so,
why is it that the elevator operators object
to asking in advance whether they can accept
American grain, or why is it necessary for
them to wait until their space is practically
all utilized before they are told that they
must not take American grain? At the present
55950-35

moment I am inclined to agree with the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that
the operators should get permission in
advance, so that storage will be guaranteed
when space is required for Canadian grain. I
should like more information about this.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I should like to refer to the questions
raised by the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), but
before doing so I want to emphasize that this
bill, although it deals with the Grain Board,
is not essentially a western bill. I happen to
know something about the western end of this
question from the point of view of the suppliers and storers of grain, and I may say
that this subject is of more concern to the consumers of Eastern Canada than it is to the
producers of Western Canada. As a representative of Ontario, I am interested in the
consumer point of view, and I would point out
that the problem raised here has a direct bearing on the vast number of Ontario farmers
who feed mixed grains to their poultry and
livestock.
The Bay port elevators are storage houses,
just the same as are the terminal elevators
at Port Arthur, Sarnia, Toronto, and so on
down the Great Lakes highway. The Bay
port elevators, however, fill up as fast as they
possibly can with whatever grain they can
get-usually barley, oats, and corn from the
United States-and subsequently supply this
grain to mills and feed dealers throughout
Eastern Canada.
The point I should like to make clear to
the honourable member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is that American
crops are harvested earlier than are ours,
and so the Bay port elevators have to prepare
at the beginning of the season for the storage
of these crops. As a matter of fact, a great
deal of the American grain crop is now
appearing on the market. Corn will soon
follow and requests from the other side for
the storage of these crops may soon be coming to the Bay port elevators. The size of
the Canadian crop will be unknown until
August, so at least two more months will
pass before the operators of these storage
warehouses will know their future operations. The new clause proposed in the bill
provides that no operator of any of these
elevators shall receive for storage any cargo
of grain from, say, the United States or the
Argentine, unless first authorized to do so
by the board. The Argentine also sends
corn in here, and there has been a great deal
of business done in this commodity. But
under the bill no elevator in these strategie
positions that I have mentioned could handle

SENATE
anything like that without first getting a
permit from the board. The amendment is
not so arbitrary.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is not so arbitrary,
nor so efficient, either.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Well, under the committee's amendment the operators of elevators at the Bay ports, say-they are the
strategic points that we have to consider in
this matter-would be free to make arrangements to utilize as much space as they
thought it was advisable to use, in taking
care of foreign corn before our own product
comes on the market.
The elevators were not filled up to the
exclusion of Canadian grain last year. In
fact, there has never been a storage crisis in
this country, simply because for many years
now the grain crop has not been large enough
to create a carry-over of any great amount.
The grain has been shipped straight down the
highway and marketed, so there has been no
storage difficulty whatever. Last year there
happened to be an abnormal production in
the United States of both wheat and corn,
and a good deal of the corn came into storage
at the Bay port elevators and elsewhere in
this country. But the use of space for that
storage did not prejudice Canadian interests
in the slightest degree.
In the committee we tried to get information on why this mandatory and rather
drastic provision should be embodied in the
Act, and why the amendment which would
enable the operators to continue their practice as in the past should not be adopted.
We received no definite information on
either head. And I would point out that the
message in which the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) today conveyed to the
house the government's view on the matter
gave no substantial reason why the amendment would not meet the situation and
should not be adopted. I am as willing as
any other member to support the original
clause in the bill if it can be shown to be
in the national interest; but unless we are
given good ground for forming an intelligent
opinion to the contrary, I think it is only
fair to assume that the principles outlined
by those who have already spoken are worth
preserving. I am speaking now from the
practical point of view, in light of the fact
that there never has been a situation such
as the original clause seems to envisage.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why should we have
the legislation at all then?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The grain business is
strictly and rigorously regulated, but in the
econornic sense a grain elevator is a business
unit, precisely the same as is a cold storage

warehouse that houses meat, poultry, eggs,
butter or any other food product. My fear
is that if the amendment is rejected there may
be no importation of the miscellaneous grains
that otherwise would come in from the United
States and South America during the two
months before our own products are ready
for the market. In that event eastern consumers will be injuriously affected; and
besides, elevator operators will be deprived
of a source of revenue upon which they
depend. Unless there is a possible emergency or crisis that would justify this mandatory provision in the bill, I can see no reason
why we should not adopt the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Suppose that again
this year it becomes necessary to store American grains and that space is available for
them, does he contend that if the amendment
is rejected the board would refuse a permit
for the storage? The board granted a permit
last year. Why should it not do so again?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The answer to my honourable friend's question is that the proposed
new subsection in the bill is mandatory, and
any of the operators of elevators which have
been in the habit of handling grain from outside would be absolutely prohibited from
making a move to handle it again without
first getting a permit from the Board of
Grain Commissioners. In every application
for space the board would be the arbiter, and
it might conclude that the government has
in mind the possibility of some kind of emergency, with insufficient space to store more
than the Canadian crop, and that no grain
should be allowed to come in from outside
until the size of our own crop is definitely
known. What I fear is that the application of
this new subsection will absolutely prohibit
the importation from the United States or the
Argentine of any grain-and of corn particularly-in the months before our own crop is
harvested.
Hon. Mr. Vien: And I would point out that
it was stated in evidence before the committee that the grain board actually requested
space which it never used.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
there is one thing that I think has been lost
sight of. All Western senators know that in
the last few years we have had a quota system of deliveries to elevators. So if there is
a large crop throughout the West a 5-bushel
quota will be imposed.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: To keep the wheat on
the farms.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. The quota is authorized by regulation and is a very fine thing,
because without it there would simply be a
rush by farmers living near the market-

JUNE 21, 1950
close to Regina or Winnipeg, for instance-to
get every last bushel of their grain sold, and
the producers farther away would not be
able to sell enough to pay expenses. To all
western grain producers let me say that it
will pay them to store their grain on their
own farms until it is ready to be shipped for
processing into flour or wheat, or to be
exported. Any farmer who thinks that he
escapes storage charges by sending his wheat
to an elevator at Fort William or Vancouver
is suffering from a delusion. The cost of
storage is added to the cost of marketing the
grain.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is taken out by the
Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. The wheat pools
were endeavouring to send the wheat forward in an orderly fashion. The honourable
gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
does not think very highly of those words
"in an orderly fashion" when used in connection with marketing by the pools. It
occurred te me that what the eastern elevator
men were askýing for at the committee was
only fair and reasonable. The question is,
what should be declared a public space. The
eastern operators wish to hold some reserve
space te take advantage of part of the business whieh they had in the past. Someone
has said that the greater part of the stored
grain was sold, and according te the senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) some of it
went to feeders in Ontario. Though grain
has frequently come to the eastern elevators
from the Argentine, it has also come from
South Africa and; other commonwealth countries, after which it was mixed with Canadian grain and then sold.
Any one who is in business knows that it
is necessary at times to make quick decisions
and to answer telegrams promptly. Such
action would net be possible if an elevator
operator had to get in touch with and secure
a permit from the Board of Grain Commissioners. For that reason I support the amendment.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
the reason I voted for this ramendment in
committee has just been stated, in effect, by
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner). The bill originally provided that before any foreign grain could' be
taken into an elevator, the operator must
apply for and get a permit to accept it. We
al know that when a permit is requested
from a board a certain amount of investigation is made before the permit is granted.
That all takes time, and before it is granted
the business may be lost. It is necessary
55950-351

that an elevator operator get permission
immediately and act quickly in order to take
advantage of the trade offered.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I have little to add te what I have
already said in this debate, except, perhaps,
by way of reply to the fair question asked
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I make no pretence of being an authority on the grain
trade, and I hope that honourable senators
in this chamber who have an intimate knowledge of the subject will correct me if I seerm
to make a misstatement of fact.
The conclusion which my honourable
friend reached is much the same as my own.
My understanding when the bill was first
introduced was that such control of elevator
space as there had been was exercised, by
the Wheat Board which, as honourable senators know, is the owner, so to speak, of the
western wheat crop. As the primary party
using the elevators, the board was charged
with the responsibility of determining what
elevator space would be retained.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That was under the
War Measures Act.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Under the Canadian
Wheat Board Act.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Apparently the prohibition of the importation of wheat has been
in existence for some time. I believe I am
right when I say that there was no control
of corn, and that the problem of elevator
space arose by reason of the amount of corn
which was being stored.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Last year?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Last year, yes. In
the past there has been authority te prohibit
the importation of wheat, but it has become
necessary to evoke the provisions of the
Customs Act to control the importation of
corn.
In introducing this bill, the minister said
that he did not think the administration of
that part of the Act having to do with
elevator space should continue in the hands
of the Wheat Board, which was in the business of selling wheat, and that it should be
placed in the hands of the Board of Grain
Commissioners.
The bill contemplates,
therefore, that the Board of Grain Commissioners will be responsible for determining the elevator space required for the
Canadian wheat crop.
While there was some suggestion that
storage space last year was insufficient, my
information is that some of the wheat was
net in a place where it could be sold-it
was back on the farm. In other words, it

SENATE

was more a question of transportation than
of storage space. Regardless of the efficiency
with which the Wheat Board has administered the Act, the minister is of opinion
that the administration should now be placed
in the hands of the Board of Grain Commissioners, and that the prohibition should
extend to corn as well as to wheat. I presume that the regulations prohibiting the
importation of wheat have been carried out
by means of permits issued to the elevator
operators.
The bill as drafted provided that the
Board of Grain Commissioners shall determine the space to be retained for the requirements of the Wheat Board on the one hand
and those of the elevator operators on the
other, with a view to keeping the elevators
as completely occupied as possible. I believe
everyone is now agreed that it is advantageous to hand over this power to the
Board of Grain Commissioners.
I come now to the proposed amendment.
My honourable friend has said, in effect
that the power remains in the hands of the
Wheat Board. I am quite willing to accept
that statement. It is then a question as to
the proper machinery for handling the prohibition. Regardless of what body administers the regulations, it is a matter of public
policy to make absolutely certain that an
adequate amount of elevator space is available for the storage of Canadian wheat. It
would seem to me that by the amendment
the Wheat Board bas power to arbitrarily
Lut off the sale of wheat. In any event,
if a crisis should arise, I presume that an
order in council could be passed under
which the entire elevator space in Canada
could be taken over, and then everybody
would have to make application to the
government for space. It is a case, as my
friend suggests, of who acts first.
My instructions are that the Board of
Grain Commissioners-not the Wheat Board
-will bc required to make absolutely certain
that adequate space is available for our
requirements, and that the regulations, as
contemplated in the original bill, are to be
as flexible as possible.
In the course of the discussion the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
bas pointed out something which had not
occurred to me. The American wheat crop is
harvested much earlier than ours. I do not
know how much storage outside of the United
States will be required for it, but evidently a
certain amount is needed from time to time,
and from my limited knowledge I assume
that, in the absence of any control by the
Board of Grain Commissioners, it would be
open to the operator of any Canadian elevator

to contract for not only transient but longterm storage of United States wheat-for
perhaps one, two or three years. It seems to
me that a procedure whereby the operators
must apply to the Board of Grain Commissioners for authority to store American wheat,
and the board must give consideration to
Canadian needs, will enable the board to keep
abreast of the current situation, and be less
likely to result in arbitrary action on their
part than the committee's amendment would
be. I think this point of view is a reasonable
one; and it accords with the instructions I
have received.
It is difficult for me to follow the argument
of my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) that upon the passing of this
legislation, terminal or eastern elevator operators will throw up their hands and decline
to take any grain for storage in transit.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell), who is probably as well
posted as any of us on these matters, said in
committee-and, I think, repeated here-that
the administration of the Wheat Board,
which was interested primarily in the selling
of wheat, was never otherwise than co-operative. It can bc assumed, I think, that the
disposition of the Board of Grain Commissioners will be to go even further in this
direction, and it is difficult for me to believe
that, except by a grave error of judgment,
the commissioners would tie up elevator storage to an extent which would make it impossible for operators to take in wheat.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They can do it in
either event.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, in either event.
To suggest otherwise is, I think, hardly fair
to the Board of Grain Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I point out to my
leader that the power exercised under the
Wheat Board Act last year was expressed
more in the terms of this amendment than
in those of the proposed clause in the Grain
Act. The Wheat Board never had the powers
conferred on it that are contained in the
present bill. Their powers are more truly
defined in the terms of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: May I ask a question
with reference to the obtaining of the permits
which will be necessary if the bill should
pass in its original form? Can the leader say
whether the government realizes how keen
is the competition between American elevator
operators at Buffalo and Canadian elevator
operators to procure these cargoes for storage
and handling, and that action in respect of
permits must be taken almost immediately?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I cannot say that I
appreciated that consideration; but I come

JUNE 21, 195U
back to this point. My honourable friend David
said that the utmost co-operation was main- Dessureault
Duffus
tained even under the administration of the Dupuis
Wheat Board. I understand that this'prin- Fafard
ciple runs al through the system. Permits, Farquhar
of course, must be obtained, and the greatest Fraser

co-operation is desirable. But if any difference in respect of convenience exists between

the two proposals, I believe it is easier to
anticipate future needs through the method
proposed by the government, than in the
manner suggested in the amendment.

APPENDIX
OTTAWA, June 16, 1950.
The Standing Committee on Finance begs leave to report as follows:
In the order of reference of March 16, 1950, your committee was instructed
to examine into the following estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1951:A-National Revenue, being votes 259 and 268 inclusive,
B--Public Works, being votes 288 to 357 inclusive,
C-Loans and Investments, being vote 562 (Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation),
D-Public Printing and Stationery, being votes 282 to 287 inclusive,
E-Defence.
On May 8 the House adopted a report from the Committee that added the
following additional reference:
Total revenues from taxation collected by the Federal, Provincial and
Municipal Governments in Canada, and the expenditures by such Governments, showing sources of income and expenditures of same under appropriate headings, for the year 1939 and for the latest year for which the
information is available.
In accordance with the Order of the House, your committee inquired into
the estimates referred to it and into the further reference of May 8, and desires
to report as follows:
Following the reference of March 19, your committee asked the Acting
Secretary of Treasury Board to prepare a summary by main objects of expenditure and special categories, of the main estimates in the Blue Book, totalling
$2,308,000,000. This analysis is appended to this Report as "Exhibit 1".
The Acting Secretary of Treasury Board appeared before your committee
and gave further explanation of the matters mentioned in the report.
Your committee also secured from the Public Finance Division of the
Bureau of Statistics total revenues received by all governments (municipal,
provincial and federal), for the year 1939, with the main sources of these
revenues and the total expenditures of these governments for the same year
with the main purposes for which the money was expended.
This information was also secured for 1947, the latest year for which it was
available, and a comparison made. In addition the amounts of revenues and
expenditures by these governing authorities without details, which we were
advised were not readily available, for the year 1948 were also secured. This
information will be found appended to this Report as "Exhibit 2".
A statement of gross national product and net national income for the
years 1939 to 1949 is appended to this Report as "Exhibit 3".
There is also included in this report a statement received from the Acting
Secretary of Treasury Board of the total number of employees, permanent and
temporary, in the government service as at March 31, 1939, 1948, 1949 and 1950,
set out to show the increase in the respective departments of government.
This is appended to this report as "Exhibit 4".
Through circumstances beyond your committee's control, it was unable
to enquire into the estimates of the C.B.C. and Defence Departments referred
to it. The decision to leave these aside was unanimous.
Coming more directly to the order of reference, your committee suggests
that consideration be given to the following recommendations:(1) Your committee is concerned with the increase in government publications and the amount spent by the government as a whole under this heading.
Free distribution through the mails has an important bearing upon this. Your

JUNE 21 1950

committee recommends, therefore, that each department of government should
pay ordinary rates of postage on all government letters and publications and
should estimate each year for their needs in this respect.
(2) Your committee recommends that each department of government
provide a foot-note in its estimates of expenditures submitted to parliament
for the amount it will require for rentals, new buildings and repair and maintenance of existing offices. This could be made available by the Department
of Public Works, whose responsibility it is under the law to provide for new
buildings, rentals and repair and maintenance of existing offices, and also to
get from parliament the necessary money for these purposes. In this way a
true picture of what the department's administration is costing would be
had at a glance.
(3) Since there should be a true picture of the spending of each department and also the revenue each department receives, your committee recommends that each department of government furnish a statement with its
estimates showing its revenues in the preceding fiscal year, and under appropriate headings the sources from which these revenues came. The following
example indicates what is meant:
In vote 562 (Central Mortgage and Housing) by far the larger part of its
estimate is to provide housing for Defence personnel. The amount required
for this should be regarded as part of our Defence expenditure and should
be so indicated.

(4) The estimates as submitted in the current year's Estimate Blue Book
(which applies to previous years also) makes it difficult to get a clear picture
of each departmental expenditure. Your committee sees no advantage in
having scores of pages giving detail of departmental employees. Your
committee recommends that each department give a summary of its expenditures approximately in the form of the analysis appended to this report as
Exhibit 1, using expenditures in the last fiscal year prior to the late war as an
index and including also the current year's estimates and the previous year's
estimates as a comparison to the index year. This is the principle employed
in measuring cost of living and national income indices. We recommend further
that Treasury Board append to the book of estimates a summary of all
expenditures asked for, similar to that given in Exhibit 1 to this report.
(5) We recommend that the Department of Finance, through Treasury
Board, be given more direct authority in dealing with the expansion of government services in each department, and that no new service be undertaken in
any department without the recorded approval of Treasury Board. In the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1939, excluding revenue postmasters and casual labour,
the number of servants on the government's payroll was slightly over 46,000,
and the estimates required to meet total civil payrolls, including casuals, were
approximately $77,000,000. In 1950, this 46,000 had grown to 127,000 and the
amount required to meet total civil payrolls had grown to $313,000,000. As
stated, this 127,000 servants excludes certain categories which, if included for
1950, would increase the total personnel to almost 156,000. For example, there
is included in the latter figure over 14,000 employees of revenue post offices who
are paid through the Finance branch of the Post Office Department, and whose
remuneration is not provided in the estimates of the post office. This is not
a criticism of this method of employing revenue postmasters. What we wish
is merely to make clear that they are paid from public revenues. Exclusive of
revenue postmasters and casual labour, the total number of civil servants at
th'e end of March, 1948, was 118,000; at the end of March, 1949, almost 124,000;
and at the end of March, 1950, slightly over 127,000. It should be noted,
however, that this latter number includes about 3,000 added to civil service
personnel through the entry of Newfoundland into Confederation. Your
committee is of the opinion that the increase in personnel as compared with

SENATE

eleven years ago is a matter for concern, for the charges of government do not
end with the salaries of civil servants, since rental space and other items of
government expenditure follow the increase in personnel and add to the sum
total of the government's budget.
(6) Your committee recommends careful supervisiori in the future of the
cost of government permanent works. Your committee is concerned as to the
growth of all government capital expenditure (municipal, provincial and
federal). It believes that the estimates of each department should be divided
into two parts-one that would concern the ordinary expenditures and the
other showing separately the capital expenditures, so as to avoid confusion.
This method would lead to a clearer understanding of the nature of the
expenditures. All governments in future should provide for the retiring or
amortizing of moneys borrowed for such capital expenditures over a period of
years.
(7) Since the total cost of government (federal, provincial and municipal)
in Canada, is the important thing for the individual taxpayer, your committee
feels that it would be useful and helpful if information touching this could be
provided for parliament. It is easily available in that mine of information, the
Bureau of Statistics. Your committee recommends, therefore, that there be
appended to the estimates submitted to parliament a statement showing revenues
and expenditures of all governments (federal, provincial and municipal) for the
latest year for which such information is available, measured again against
1939 as an index year. Such a statement would include inter-governmental
transfers and show the main sources from which all government revenues are
secured, and on the other side expenditures of all governments with the main
purposes for expenditures. To this should be added a statement showing the
net national income of Canada as a whole, for it is out of such net national
income that Canadian people pay their taxes, all their living expenses, and
accumulate their savings. To this should be added the movement of the cost
of living index, which is now at the highest point it has reached. Your committee feels that if this information were available, members of
parliament,
legislatures and municipal councils-and the public generally-could get a
clearer understanding of the working of the whole Canadian economy.
Your committee makes the following general observations:
One of the most important matters that democratic government anywhere
has to deal with is the amount of revenue it takes from the people in the various
taxes it imposes, and the sources from which the revenue is derived; and
equally important that the revenue thus secured be expended efflciently and
with due regard to economy. In the different appendices to this
report 1939,
the last pre-war year, is taken as a base for measurement. Your committee
considers it very important that not only those charged with the duty of
governing in all our fields of government, but citizens generally have a clear
understanding of the relationship of taxation to net national income. Thus,
if an increase in total expenditures by all governments is kept in step with an
increase in national income, the weight of taxation relatively is not
increased,
though it may vary as between individual groups; but if expenditures increase
at a more rapid rate than national income it follows that an increasing burden
of taxation must be imposed upon the people if governments are to pay their
way. It should be added that if a decline in national income should ensue
through the loss of markets, lower prices, or a substantial rise in unemployment
and if at the same time a reduction in total Government expenditures cannot
be brought about to match the decline in national income, then only one or two
results follows-either increases in taxation or unbalanced budgets. During
the three years following the war substantial reductions in total public debt
took place. This was all to the good. Since then this trend appears to be
changing and to be headed in the other direction. Your committee feels that

JUNE 21, 1950

in this important field of our nation's business the storm signals are flying, and
it ventures to suggest that all governments (municipal, provincial and federal)
should give serious thought to this matter; for all, though operating in independent spheres of government, have a joint responsibility. The important
thing for the individual citizen is not the amount of taxes he pays to each of
these independent governing authorities, but the total amount in taxes that they
take out of his income every year. Moreover, he must learn that the idea of
free government service in any field is an illusion. No government service
anywhere, at any time, is free. It must be paid for by taxation or borrowing,
and both these hold dangers if carried beyond fair and reasonable bounds.
Since this is the first occasion upon which Senate committees have examined
into Estimates in recent years, your committee in its work had no precedent to
assist it in the discharge of its duties. Should the practice be continued in
future years of inquiry into estimates by Senate committees, we think this
procedure could be improved.
Your committee desires also to express its appreciation of the frank manner
in which the witnesses called before it gave information covering expenditures
in their respective departments.
Your committee has made the observations in this report in the hope that
it will make some contribution to the vexing problems all governments in
Canada face today.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
T. A. CRERAR,

Chairman.

STATEMENTS ATTACHED

Source:
1939-"Comparative Statistics of Public Finance", prepared for the Dominion-Provincial Conference on Reconstruction, 1945.
1947-Based on compilations of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and Bank
of Canada, for comparative purposes.
Explanatory Note:
The totals appearing on line 23 of the revenue table and line 18 of the
expenditure table do not include inter-governmental transfers in the form of
general subsidy payments, which. are set out separately at the foot of each table.
For instance, the Dominion B.N.A. Act and Tax Agreement Subsidies to the
provinces are excluded from expeniditures of the Dominion and correspondingly
omitted from, the revenues of the provinces. However, grants-in-aîd for specific
services, such as for health or old age pensions, are included as expenditures of
the government making the grant but deducted from the gross expenses of the
other level of government which received the grant.
These procedures are followed to avoid duplication in order to produce
additive totals of both revenue and expenditure for ail levels of government.

OTTAWA, June 12, 1950
MEMORANDUM TO PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMIMITTEE

In response to a request made by the Committee asking for the estimated
numbers of employees of the Government of Canada, I arn transmitting the
attached table showing the number of these employees reported by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics as of March 31, 1939, 1948 and 1949, together with the
numbers that the Bureau of Statisties expeets now to report for March 31, 1950.
In addition, we have put in for March 31, 1950, the total numbers including
casual employees on construction and other work, together with Post Office
employees paid fromn revenue which are not included in the Bureau of Statistics
totals but which appear to be covered in the numbers requested by the Coinmittee. 1 have also added a total for the Crown Corporations and corporate
agencies of the Government other than the Canadian National Railways and
its subsidiaries and certain joint Dominion-Provincial bodies which has been
obtained in part from the employment statistics of the Bureau of Statistics.
It should be noted that the difference between the preiiminary Bureau of
Statistics figures for March, 1950, and the larger total reported by the Department of Finance is due almost entirely to the inclusion of 14,065 employees of
Revenue Post Offices paid through the Financial Branch of the Post Office
Department fromn Revenue funds rather than appropriations, and the inclusion
of roughly the saine number of casual employees. There are other minor
differences in the coverage of the figures by departments which are mainly
explained by the footnotes. Certain other small differences in the figures are
due to the manner in which they have been compiled. For example, some of
the figures available appear to us to be the maximum number employed during
the month rather than the month-end figures which we have asked for specifically in the reports made to the Department of Finance.
It should be noted that a considerable portion of the increase in the
number of Civil Servants between March, 1949 and March, 1950 is due to the
taking over of Dominion-type services in Newfoundland. It is not possible
to give an exact figure on this comparable to the figures in this report, but we
understand that the increase due to Newfoundland is approximately of the
order of 3,000 employees.

SENATE

An examination of the figures given for previous years in the Dominion
Bureau of Statisties' latest published memorandumn shows that the post-war
peak, apart from the increase due to Newfoundland, was reached at March,
1947. There was a moderate decline subsequent to March 1947, which was
then reversed, and the expansion in numbers due to the entry of Newfoundland
into Canada has now carried the total slightly above that of 1947.

CANADIAN
NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Paul H. Bouffard presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 310, an Act to authorize
the provision of moneys to meet certain capital expenditures made and capital indebtedness incurred by the Canadian Natiorial Railways System during the calendar year 1950,
and to authorize the guarantee by His
Majesty of certain securities to be issued by
the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee have, in obedience to the order of
reference of June 20, 1950, examined the said
bill, and now beg leave to report the same
without any amendment.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave, I move the
third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
THE ESTIMATES'
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON TOURIST TRAFFIC

Your committee examined the expenditures proposed by Votes 370 to 398 both inclusive.
The
Director of the National Parks Service, Department
of Resources and Development was heard with
respect to the above mentioned votes. Your committee noted a decrease in the amount to be voted
for resources and development.
The Director of Special Projects, Department of
Resources and Development, informed your committee that Vote 389 and the statutory item covering the capital expenditures in conformity with
section 8 (1) of the Eastern Rocky Mountain Forest
Conservation Act has added considerably to the
tourist attraction of the 8,585 square miles under the
jurisdiction of the Eastern Rockies Forest Conservation Board. These expenses are shared by the
federal government and the Government of Alberta.
The federal government providing $6,300,000 for
capital expenditures and the sum of $175,000 annually for maintenance, while the provincial government provides $125,000 annually for maintenance.
Your committee was informed that if the provincial
government received revenue from grazing, timber,
etc., from the property under the jurisdiction of the
board, of a sum over $125,000 it would be deducted
from the $175,000 paid by the federal government.
Permits are required from the board before any
timber may be cut or any domestic animals permitted to graze on the land controlled by the board.
This is closely controlled in order to provide ample
grazing for wild game and to preserve the natural
habitat for large game animals which are a great
source of attraction to tourists.
Your committee recommends that the policy of
referring the Estimates to the various standing
committees of the Senate be continued at the next
session of parliament and the practice of laying
them before parliament early in the session be
continued.
Your committee recommends that at the next
session of parliament, if the policy of referring
Estimates to committees be continued, authority be
granted for the printing of its day to day
proceedings.
Your committee desires to express an appreciation
to the officials who appeared before it and to thank
them for the enlightening information they placed
before the committee.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
'consideration?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Next sitting.

Hon. W. A. Buchanan presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic,
to whom were referred certain estimates laid REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
before parliament for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1951.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen presented the report
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant, of the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications, to whom were referred
as follows:
Your committee confined its consideration of the certain estimates laid before parliament for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1951.
Estimates entirely to those effecting tourist traffic.
Your committee examined the expenditures proThe report was read by the Clerk Assistant,
posed by Vote 399 respecting the estimates of the
Canadian Travel Bureau.
The Director of the as follows:
Canadian Travel Bureau

explained in

detail the

efforts made by the Bureau te attract American

tourists ta Canada. Your committee was impressed
with the efficiency of the Canadian Travel Bureau
and was pleased to note that the cost of advertising
and other forms of promotion in the past year did
not exceed one per cent of the American dollars
spent in Canada by American tourists. Your committee notes an increase in the proposed expenditures of $175,000 on advertising and publicity. This
is considered justified due ta the anticipated increase
in the number of American tourists it is expected

ta attract ta Canada.

Your committee held three sittings. The first
sitting was devoted to the Post Office votes, and
there were present at that meeting the Deputy
Postmaster General, Mr. W. J. Turnbull, and certain of his senior officials. At the second and third
meetings the votes of the Transport Department
were considered, and at either or both there were
in attendance Mr. J. C. Lessard, Deputy Minister
Administrative, Marine and Canal Services, and Mr.
C. P. Edwards, Deputy Minister for Air, accompanied by certain of their officials; the third meeting
was also attended by Mr. J. V. Clyne, Chairman of
the Canadian Maritime Commission.

SENATE
A large number of questions were asked by members of your committee in relation to the various
items of these estimates for which the respective
Departmental officials were responsible, and in all
instances these questions were answered to the
satisfaction of your committee and a good deal of
interesting and valuable information obtained with
regard to various -of the departmental activities
which came under review.
Speaking in a general way, and as a result of the
experience which it bas gained, your committee
thinks that this system of examining departmental
estimates bas a good deal to recommend it, from
the point of view both of the senators who are
members of the committee and of the senior officials
of the department concerned.
The members of your committee gained much
knowledge of the workings of the departments in the
various fields in which they are called upon to serve
the people of Canada; while the departmental officials have the opportunity, which is sometimes not
easily available in other ways, of explaining the
reasons for, and the scope of, their different activities and of justifying the expenditures of public
funds needed for the purpose of carrying on these
activities.
In no case did your committee find any evidence
of extravagance or waste; any increases asked for
over the estimates for the preceding fiscal year
appeared, when examined into, to be justified; and
in general, your committee was impressed with the
care that had been taken in preparing the estimates
for the consideration of parliament and in confining
such estimates strictly within the limits of what is
essential in order to carry on the work for which
respectively
are
concerned
departments
the
responsible.
At the present time the Post Office Department
carries free all official mail originating from other
government departments. Your committee recommends that studies be made with a view to determining whether it would not be a better system for
each department to pay for its own postage; this
might have the result of limiting any tendency
which may now exist in the departments to make
excessive or unnecessary use of the mails; and
would in any event more accurately reflect in the
revenues of the Post Office Department the value of
the services which that department performs.
Your committee believes that in certain instances
the language descriptive of items of expense appearing in the estimates or in the details of services
could be improved so as to give a clearer idea of
what the expenditure is actually intended to cover.
For example, an item appears in the expenditures
of every department which is shown under the
standard heading of "Telegrams, Telephones and
Postage" In the great majority of cases this is no
doubt sufficiently descriptive. But in Vote 503 of the
Department of Transport, Civil Aviation Division,
Airway and Airport Traffic Control, the details
appearing on page 302 show for the current year,
under this heading "Telegrams, Telephones and
Postage," a contemplated expenditure of no less
than $430,000.00. When questioned on this item, the
Deputy Minister of Transport for Air explained that
it includes the entire system of telegraphic and
telephonie control at and between airports of all
commercial airplanes from one end of the country
to the other. Your committee suggests that, to avoid
misunderstanding, this item should in future be
more accurately described and, if necessary, broken
down under separate headings, so as to show clearly
the sort of service that it is intended to cover.
Your committee expresses the opinion that the
system of examination of the estimates of departments by standing committees has demonstrated its
value and should be continued in future sessions.

Your committee recommends that in future years
the evidence given before such standing committees
be taken down in shorthand and printed.

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Monday next.
REPORT

OF COMMITTEE ON
AND LABOUR

IMMIGRATION

Hon. Cairine Wilson presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Immigration
and Labour, to whom were referred certain
estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1951.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as foltows:
Your committee has held six meetings. At the
first meeting officers of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration appeared before the committee, when the deputy minister, Colonel Laval
Fortier, gave a general review of the work of the
three branches of the department, viz., Citizenship,
The overall
Immigration, and Indian Affairs.
estimate of $14,993,716 for the year 1950-51 would be
sufficient for the present staff, but an increase might
be anticipated for 1951-52, due to the fact that this
is a new department and the establishment has not
yet been completed.
In addition to Colonel Fortier, the following
officers from the department were heard and
questioned:
Mr. George Benoit, Administrative Officer,
Dr. Frank Foulds, Director, Citizenship Branch,
Mr. J. E. Duggan, Registrar, Canadian Citizens,
Major D. M. MacKay, Director of Indian Affairs.

The Immigration Division is responsible for all
immigration to Canada and maintains officers abroad
as well as in Canada in order to assure that those
who come to this country fulfil the requirements of
the Immigration Act.
Your committee notes the decrease in the estimates for these two services and also that there bas
been a substantial decrease in immigration to
Canada during the past year. Your committee feels
that increased immigration to Canada, both from
the United Kingdom and the continent of Europe,
is desirable.
Citizenship Branch
The committee was informed that the increase of
approximately $38,000 in the cost of educational and
informational materials was a resuit of the increase
in the requests from the provinces for information
and material of this type. It was also stated that
before any material was forwarded to societies or
individuals it was first concurred in by the provinces. The committee was informed that the federal
government did net in any way contribute to the

JUNE 22, 1950
salary of teachers in the provinces, but did help in
administrative matters, when requested by the provinces to do so.
Indian Affairs Branch
In reply to a question by the committee, it was
stated that the increase in travelling expenses in the
Indian Affairs Branch for Indian Agencies of some
$70,000 represented new work being done by the
Indian Affairs Branch, which was formerly done by
the Department of Mines and Resources.
Major D. M. MacKay was questioned regarding a
possible duplication of personnel with the engineering branch, Department of Public Works of Canada.
He explained that the engineers on the staff of the
Indian Affairs Branch had been transferred from
the Department of Mines and Resources.
The
reservations are so widely scattered, and in order
to carry out recommendations of the Parliamentary
Committee on Indian Affairs it has been necessary
to construct many additional one-room schools and
add to those now being used, as well as to furnish
more and better equipped hospitals. The Education
Division has expanded and modernized. Approximately 22,000 Indian children are carrying on studies
this year in 72 residential schools and 432 day-school
classrooms.
Labour Department
From the Department of Labour the Deputy
Minister, Mr. MacNamara submitted a report which
covered the many branches under his administration.
The Department of Labour proper for the fiscal
year 1950-51 is asking a total appropriation of
$10,055,133-a decrease of $2,033,549 from the previous year 1949-50.
The Labour Department administers dominionprovincial farm agreements. Vote 157 provides
$320,000 for the effective organization and use of
agricultural manpower.
The Labour Department is also responsible in
co-operation with the Department of Immigration
for the bulk movement of displaced persons. When
the workers arrive in Canada and are cleared by
the Immigration Department they are taken in
charge by the Department of Labour, and placements are made.
The Department of Labour is responsible for the
administration of the Annuities Act. Last year the
price of annuities was increased. This was necessary
for two reasons
(a) the mortality tables had to be adjusted
because people are living to a greater age, and
(b) the 4 per cent rate which was being allowed
on money paid in was reduced to 3 per cent.
This increase in cost has reduced the number of
sales by about 50 per cent in the last fiscal year, as
compared with the previous year.
Your committee asks that a careful study be made
of the Annuities Branch in order to learn if it can
be satisfactorily maintained at the present rate.
The Vocational Training Branch administers the
Vocational Training Co-ordination Act of 1942, which
provides in co-operation with the provinces for
quite a broad field of training. It includes youth
training, apprenticeship training, vocational school
assistance, foremanship and supervisory training,
training of persons to fit them for gainful employment, training of persons to fit them for the armed
forces, as well as vocational correspondence courses.
Your committee feels that it might be possible to
bring about some co-ordination of this service with
the Educational -Branch of the Department of Citizenship, as both branches work in co-operation with
the provinces.
Unemployment Insurance Commission
0f the total moneys for the Unemployment Insurance Commission, $23 million is for the government's

contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund
as provided in the Unemployment Insurance Act,
and this amount is not controllable. The sum of
$1,500,000 has been set up to provide for unemployment assistance to certain residents of Newfoundland. The remainder-approximately $22 millionis for administrative costs in connection with unemployment insurance, employment services, payment
of supplementary benefits of unemployment insurance, payment of unemployment assistance in Newfoundland, placement, employment, and follow-up
services for D.P.'s and collection of statistical
information regarding the labour force. This amount
is $1,700,000 greater than last year. An increase in
the amount for salaries and wages of $1,200,000 is
the principal reason, and this was necessary owing
to the general salary revision. The remainder was
necessary owing to increases in rents, travel expenses, equipment, stationery, etc.
Your committee is of the opinion that through
this scrutiny of the estimates the members have
now a much better understanding of the administration of the Department of Labour and of the
Department'of Citizenship and Immigration, which
will be of great advantage in subsequent sessions.
The members of the committee would like to
express their appreciation to the Ministers, Deputy
Ministers, and officials, who have shown such willingness to assist your committee in every way
possible.

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the
report be taken into consideration?

SUSPENSION OF RULES
1

MOTION

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That for the balance of the present session Rules
23, 24 and 63 be suspended in so far as they relate
to public bills.

He said: I would remind honourable senators that this motion is customary at this
stage of the session. Honourable members
may still object to the variation of the rules
in this regard, but of course the wishes of
the majority of the house will carry. I am
always a little hesitant about making this
motion because I invariàbly receive unanimous consent to do anything that seems reasonable. But as I say, this procedure is
customary.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am quite in favour of the
motion, though I really do not think the
leader needs it, because I am leaving the city
tomorrow night.
The motion was agreed to.
DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 311, an Act to amend
The Dominion Elections Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable senators, the main
purpose of this bill is to extend the franchise
in federal elections to all Eskimos and to
additional classes of Indians. At the present

SENATE

time no reservations are allotted to Eskimos,
and although they are as subject to federal
taxation as any other citizen they are not
permitted to vote. In view of this circumstance, the government can see no reason
why they should be denied the franchise any
longer.
At present, all Indians who are not living
on reservations have the franchise.

Those

Indians who are on reservations cannot vote
unless they are veterans of World War I or
II or the wives of such veterans.

One of

the chief reasons for denying the franchise
to reservation Indians has been that they
were exempted from personal property tax
and in that respect were in a privileged position in comparison with other citizens. This
bill would permit any reservation Indian
who waived his exemption from personal

property tax to vote at federal elections.
The bill contains two other provisions.
The first provides that in federal elections
nomination day for certain constituencies is
to be the twenty-eighth day before polling

day.

At the present time the date for the

close of nominations is fourteen days before

The reason that the period in Yukon-

Mackenzie is longer is to give the returning

officer ample time to distribute the balloting
machinery in that area, where distances are
great and travelling conditions very difficult.
It is felt that certain other constituencies
are in a similar position, and for this reason
it has been deemed advisable to extend the
provisions now solely applicable to Yukon-

Mackenzie to the constituencies listed in
schedule four, in section 4 of this bill.
The other amendment relates to appeals
to Supreme Court judges in actions taken

under the Dominion Elections Act.

At the

present time there is a right of appeal to such
judges in all provinces other than Newfoundland. By section 3 this right of appeal is
extended to Newfoundland.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not object to the
bill. I am glad that, under schedule four, a
number of constituencies will have the benefit of the longer period that now applies only

Eskimos in my province. All of them do not
live in Winnipeg; some are located in and
around Churchill and other northern parts of
Manitoba; and I support the extension of
the franchise to them.
The only question this bill raises in my

mind is whether it was wise to include the
section about Indians until the bill to amend

the Indian Act has been passed. I raise the
point as a legal, not a political objection. The

object of the Indian bill is to make these people citizens, and of course if they become
citizens they will have to pay income tax. I
am not certain that they will want to do that.
I am sure that a great number of us would
exchange the right to vote for the right to
be on the Indian list!
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would be quite happy if
I did not have to pay income tax for at least
one or two years. It is my opinion that
Indians should not come under this measure
until the bill to amend the Indian Act is
passed, but I will not go so far as to say that
this bill should only receive second reading
on division. As there is little principle
involved, I do not think it is necessary to
have the bill referred to committee, and if
necessary the Dominion Elections Act could
be amended next year.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The question which
has been raised by the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) is important. As

a matter of fact, when I originally asked that

this order stand, I anticipated that the bill
to amend the Indian Act might have been
dealt with during this session.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It has been announced in
the other place that it has been withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes. I had thought
that it would be wise to hold this bill in
case anything might arise in connection
with the Indian Act which would necessitate
the amending of this bill; but I think it
advisable that we give the bill second reading now, because it has already been
approved by the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Haig: All right.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: I understand that a
certain clause in this bill provides that once
an Indian decides to be naturalized he cannot change his mind. I doubt whether that
is a fair clause, because many Indians are
not in a position to decide for themselves
just what is in their own interests.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I doubt if such a provision is to be found in this bill; but if the
bill is given second reading I should be quite
happy to have it referred to committee, where
any questions could be answered. I rather
gather, however, that my honourable friend
is referring to a clause in the Indian Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right. I do not
think it is in this bill at all.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
I have not before me a copy of the bill,
but if I correctly understood the explanation
given by the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
the bill confers the franchise on IndiansHon. Mr. Hugessen: Eskimos.

JUNE 22, 1950
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What about Indians on
reserves?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The bill confers the
right to vote upon wives of Indians who
served in the armed forces.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, heretofore, Indians
who served in the armed forces have had the
right to vote.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
the deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) is
right in saying that the bill confers on the
wives of Indian veterans the right to vote.
The bill would also permit any reservation
Indian who waived his exemption from personal property tax to vote in federal elections.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That was the point I had
in mind. I am not clear as to how that could
be done, but probably the information could
be obtained in committee. Today most Indians
in Canada live on reservations, which are
their property. Any Indian can become a
Canadian citizen in the full sense of the word
if he desires to do so. During the war it was
held by the courts that Indians were liable for
military service, and that fact in itself would
appear to confer on them certain rights of
citizenship. However, at the moment the
whole matter is in the region of uncertainty.
Obviously, one test of citizenship is whether
a person is enfranchised. Another test is
whether he bas the right to go into a liquor
store and buy liquor, or to enter a tavern and
drink beer. Under the present law Indians
can do neither of these things.
Just how an Indian on a reservation could
accept taxation on his property in order that
he might be qualified to vote is not at all
clear. In the past if an Indian became a full
citizen he had all the rights of the white man.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Could he stay on the
reservation then?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, in the past he would
not have been allowed to stay on the reservation. I cannot see just how this amendment
would work out, and I have raised the point
because I think it is important. Doubtless an
explanation can be given if the bill goes to
committee.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
think most members of the Senate will be
strongly in favour of the provisions of this
bill. Now that the government is recognizing
that Indians are full citizens of this country
by giving them the vote, I hope that the more
laudable step of providing them with old age
pensions will be taken. If we wish to make
our Indians true citizens we should give them
all the rights.of citizenship. Anyone who sat
on the Indian Affairs Committee for three
years, as I did, must have come to the conclusion that the charity doled out in many

forms-and, by the way, it differs in different provinces-is not very becoming to a
nation like Canada. This charity is costing
the country some money, and surely it is not
too much to hope that the present practice can
be discontinued and pensions made available
to Indians of seventy years and over.
I do not know whether the bill is going to
committee or not, but I think one section
should be carefully considered, namely, the
one providing that the giving of the right to
vote to an Indian is conditional upon his
waiving exemption from taxation on personal
property in the reservation where he lives.
My principal purpose in rising was to commend the bill in general to the house. In
closing, let me repeat the hope that the government will make Indians eligible for old age
pensions on the same terms as are applicable
to other Canadians.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON NATURAL
RESOURCES CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources, to whom were referred
certain estimates.
Hon. John A. McDonald moved concurrence
in the report.
- He said: Honourable senators, I do not think
you would wish me to speak at length on
this report. I find that when acting as Chairman of a committee I easily form the habit
of talking too much. However, the bouse
would doubtless be interested to hear other
senators, whether members of the committee
or not, express their views in approval of or
against the report.
On behalf of the members of the committee I wish to thank the deputy ministers and
heads of departmental divisions who co-operated with us so well in the study of agricultural, fisheries, mining and technical service
estimates. We did not have to postpone a
meeting even once because of inability of a
deputy minister or head of division or other
officer to attend and answer questions. The
ministers of the departments concerned were
also very co-operative in every way, and
only too glad to have their officers give us
all assistance possible.

SENATE
I feel that I am but voicing the sentiment
of all members of the committee when I say
that we found the study of these estimates
very interesting and highly instructive. And
it certainly can be truly said that when the
time comes to vote supply to cover these
estimates, members of the committee will
understand, as never before, what the money
is to be spent for.
Your committee recommends that the policy
initiated at this session of referring estimates
to the standing committees be continued at
the next session. We believe that this policy
serves to promote economy and efficiency in
the public service. Your committee further
recommends that if the policy is continued
next session a stenographic record of the
committee's proceedings be taken and printed
from day to day. We felt it was perhaps a mistake not to have asked for authority to obtain
a verbatim report this year, for such a report
would be very helpful to members of the
committee, to members of parliament in
general, to the public, and perhaps most of
all to ministers and departmental officers.
The members of your committee are greatly
concerned over the ever-increasing expenditure of public moneys, not only by the
dominion government but by provincial and
municipal authorities as well. It is for this
reason we are suggesting that a determined
effort be made by all departments of government to reduce their estimates next year
wherever possible and where not inconsistent
with the public welfare. Increased expenditures for various social services are now being
considered. In order to meet these expenditures we must either increase taxation or
reduce other expenditures. I hope that the
people of Canada realize that the government's only source of revenue, directly or
indirectly, is the pockets of the people.
Though your committee found co-operation between the services of federal and
provincial governments, it realized the danger
that over a term of years a duplication of
services might develop. We suggest therefore that the federal and provincial ministers, their deputies and heads of divisions,
meet again for the purpose of eliminating
any possible duplication.
When I took over office in my native province, a meeting was arranged between the
federal minister and the leading officers of his
department in Ottawa, on the one hand, and
the provincial minister and the heads of his
divisions, on the other, to review the agricultural services of both governments. We
attempted at that time to draw a clear line of
demarcation between the federal field and the
provincial field. In my opinion, the meeting
was well worth while, and avoided much
duplication of services.

The committee found several instances of
duplication between the architectural and
engineering staffs, particularly in the departments of Agriculture and Fisheries. We felt
that these services should be centralized in
the Department of Public Works, and that
each department should make the estimates
for its own public works, buildings and equipment. It came to our attention that the agricultural estimates contained an item of
$3,200,000 for the acquisition or construction
of buildings and public works, and also that
there was in the public works estimates an
item of $500,000 for experimental farms and
science laboratories and for replacements,
repairs and improvements to buildings.
The committee was con-cerned about the
large sums of money being spent on publicity,
and offers the suggestion that federal publicity be administered, as is done by some
provincial governments, by one department.
I am sure that every honourable senator
receives daily, as I do, a great deal of material
which is never read and is consigned to the
waste paper basket. This condition may be
due to a lack of interest on our part; nevertheless it results in a waste of government
money.
We are suggesting as another measure
of economy that each department of government should be required to pay its own
postage. This would result in both direct
and indirect savings by each department.
The Post Office Departmeift bas estimated
that its loss of revenue through the franking
privilege is about $4 million a year. It is not
felt, however, that our recommendation
should affect the franking privileges of
members of parliament, at least until a system such as that used in the United States is
put into operation here. My understanding
is that the representatives of the people in
that country are allowed a certain amount
of money for postage in lieu of the franking
privilege.
Honourable senators, I wish to express my
appreciation to the honourable leader and
others who had to do with my being selected
chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the
work, I should like to suggest that next
session the Committee on Selection should
nominate as chairman one of the many capable members of the committee this year.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the courteous and efficient manner
in which the honourable senator from Kings
(Hon. Mr. McDonald) perforined the duties of

JUNE 22, 1950
chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. My sentiment in this regard applies
in equal measure to the chairmen of all
committees of which I was a member.
I should like to draw the attention of the
house to the fact that throughout their
deliberations the meetings of al committees
were absolutely free from political bias or
party prejudice. The desire of each member
seemed to be to get for himself, the senators
generally and for the public all possible iniformation on the estimates, with a view to
reducing the cost of government to the
Canadian people.
Credit is due to all committees which considered the estimates this session, and I trust
that the practice of appointing committees to
consider the estimates will be continued in
future sessions.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Being a member
of the committee, I should like to see efforts
made in order to show civil servants that
they will find in their midst people who are
ready to co-operate, who try to fathom, in all
their details, our country's administrative
problems. I should also like civil servants to
realize that, in both houses, there are individuals who want to collaborate with them. They
must likewise understand they cannot be
dictators, forcing senators and members to
come under their yoke. Now, upon examining
what goes on in each department, as well as
the work assigned to each employee, I feel
the best procedure in organizing our economics, namely our political and social
economics, is to obtain the aforesaid cooperation.
When a government official appears before
a committee and he is asked to explain a
certain matter, it is not merely to find out
whether a pin has or has not been purchased
as set out in the estimates, and whether this
official has actually used this pin to fasten
some papers. What we are after are practical and fundamental facts.
Let us remember this. In the application of
our laws, as in the output of each factory
worker, when trying to build something
worthwhile, whether it be for the benefit of
the nation or for that of private enterprise,
all must work in unison if the undertaking is
to meet with success.
Another point which I should like to stress
is the duplication found in certain federal and
provincial departments. Autonomy must be
saved, is the by-word. However it is only
by working shoulder to shoulder, hand in
hand, that an organization may bring about
the prosperity and welfare of all our citizens.

In final analysis as the chairman of the committee mentioned a moment ago, when something is very expensive the money to pay
for it comes out of every taxpayer's pocket.
Thirdly, let us come back to civil servants,
and to the recommendation whereby better
training should be given in our institutions
so that our employees may show greater
efficiency in the performance of their assigned
tasks. Unfortunately, some employees are
not sufficiently trained for their job. Some
have studied to become lawyers, notaries or
physicians. After having failed in all their
attempts they try an examination and become
civil servants.
Courses should be given generally to
develop the science of public administration,
as today the training of a competent official
has become a problem. It is also a problem
to enact laws and to see that such laws are
applied to the needs of men, instead of adaptIt is an
ing the latter to our laws.
unfortunate fact that those who are poorly
prepared do not understand such things. Some
people live between four walls and do not
know how the other half of the world lives.
They expect to live in this world and lay
down in absolutely arbitrary fashion the
application of laws and principles. They
should not be blamed too much as they do
not know any better. Therefore the clause
just mentioned should be taken in good part.
Let the science of political economics be
further developed, not only in theory but in
practice. I feel that in the near future, with
the help of members of parliament, senators
and other leaders, and of those who are
rseponsible for the application of our laws,
Canada may, finally achieve an economic
status that will be better balanced, less costly
and more beneficial.
(Text):
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: One recommendation in the report with which I am in
sympathy is that relating to the need for
centralization of publicity. At some time,
possibly at the next session of parliament, a
special committee of the Senate should examine the growth of and expenditure on publicity, which of course includes printing
and other related costs. I believe considerable
waste and much overlapping could be overcome if a thorough study were made of outlays
on these services, and it might be well for
a committee of the Senate to confine itself
during the next session to an inquiry of
The work of the Joint
that nature.

SENATE
Committee on the Printing of Parliament, is
limited to that subject, and I believe that
to investigate publicity expenditures a
special committee would be needed.
In my business as the publisher of a newspaper I find that more and more wastepaper baskets are required in the office to
accommodate the material which comes to
us from Ottawa and is at once cast aside. I
do not say that all that material is useless,
but I think the supply could be curtailed
if people were consulted as to whether they
wanted it or wanted it all. There are some
who require these departmental publications;
a great many others do not; but everybody,
particularly newspapers, are being loaded
up with publicity from various branches of
government, and most of it, in my experience, is discarded at once. I know that
is our practice.
There is a good deal of criticism of the
publicity expenditures made by nearly all
the departments. If the Senate were to
make a study of these outlays and ascertain
whether or not any economies could be
effected-for instance through the consolidation of this type of expenditure under one
control-we could render good service to the
taxpayers of Canada.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: I intend to call attention to only one recommendation of this
committee; but before I do so, allow me
to tell the chairman that if in that capacity
he has one fault, it is that he leans backward
a little too far; he is so loath to offend anybody. I advise him to give some of the
members a "poke in the eye" once in a
while; it will do them good.
The recommendation that these committee proceedings be printed from day to
day is most important. The officials of one
of the departments, for whose minister I have
great respect, were called before this committee and examined very thoroughly. They
gave us straightforward and, in my judgment, honest answers. But the minister
offered this criticism. He said: "My dear
Haig, I have no record of the questions you
asked my officials. I have no desire to
criticize them for whatever replies they
made, and they know that they need expect
no criticism from me, for presumably they
answered according to their best judgment.
But I should like to know what were the
departmental matters they were questioned
about." I said: "There is no use asking me,
because I know nothing about fisheries.
Our chairman might remember what happened, but in the absence of a record only

those who understand the problem would
recall what was said." I plead sincerely
that when this work is resumed next year,
the proceedings be reported-not primarily
for our own information but for the benefit
of the government, the House of Commons
and the officials. It may be that the witnesses, if they had the opportunity to read
in cold print the questions they were asked
and the answers they gave, would resolve
so to improve their service that the following
year their evidence would be more reassuring.
A further suggestion which occurs to me
is this: that the next time the house is about
to set up committees, a small committee
composed, perhaps, of chairmen, be formed
with the object of advising how the work
can best be distributed. The work of some
of the committees is interrelated; others
carry on more independently. I think it
would be useful to make a systematic
examination.
If the investigation of estimates is to be
effective, those estimates must be tabled in
the House o Commons early in the session.
This year they arrived here, I think, on the
18th or 19th of March, but if we do not get
them until after the Easter recess, we have
little time to study them before they are taken
up by the committees. Had I been serving on
the Standing Committee of Natural Resources, as was the honourable senator from Kings
(Hon. Mr. McDonald), I should like to have
been able to study the departmental estimates
so that I could formulate the questions I
wanted to ask. We ought to urge the government to bring down the estimates early in the
session, as it did this year; and a steering
committee should be appointed to help allocate the members among the various committees dealing with the estimates.
Honourable senators, to my knowledge this
report is the only one which contains a recommendation dealing with the education of
high school students. This recommendation
reads:
Your committee suggests that courses in the principles of civil government, federal, provincial and
municipal, be more generally taught in high
schools, and that the public be made aware of the
relationship between the burden of taxation they
carry and the social and other services they
demand.

It is shocking that our high school students
-at
least those in my city-know so little
about these matters. Quite often different
men will call me up and ask me how many
senators there are from Manitoba, and when
I tell them there are six, they want to know
their names. They say to me: "I know you
are a senator, but who else is one?" I have
many inquiries from people asking me to
name the various members of the Senate

JUNE 22, 1950
and of the House of Commons. Sometimes,
in a moment of weakness, I listen to radio
quiz programs, I remember one occasion on
which the question was asked: "Who is the
federal Minister of Trade and Commerce?"
and believe it or not, the person who was
asked did not know. I should have thought
that this minister would be known to everyone. I only offer these examples to illustrate the need for giving our children-the
future fathers and mothers of the nation-a
broader education in parliamentary affairs.
We 'frequently hear glib criticism of our
federal parliament, our provincial legislatures
and our municipal bodies; but for the most
part the very persons who make the criticisms
know nothing' about the affairs of the
country.
I believe that this recommendation is an
important one and should be called to the
attention of the provincial departments of
education. It does not interfere with the
autonomy of the provinces in dealing with
educational matters, but merely suggests to
them that courses in the principles of civil
government, federal, provincial and municipal, should be made available, thrôugh our
high schools to the future citizens of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CANADIAN TRADE
RELATIONS CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Canadian Trade Relations, to whom were
referred certain estimates.
Hon. W. D. Euler moved concurrence in the
report.
He said: honourable senators, this report
really speaks for itself, but I might just refer
to one or two points because honourable
members may not have had an opportunity
of reading the report.
Perhaps one of the best reasons for having
these estimates dealt with by our various
standing committees is that it gives the members an opportunity of securing information
which they apparently would not otherwise
acquire. I particularly have in mind the
information we obtained about the functions
of the National Research Council when Dr. C.
J. Mackenzie appeared before us. That was
one of the most profitable sessions we held.
We also heard Mr. M. W. Mackenzie, Deputy
Minister of Trade and Commerce, and Mr.
Sim, the Comptroller-Secretary. As set out
in the last paragraph of our report, these
witnesses provided the committee with will55950-37 -

ing and valuable assistance. They gave an
impression of efficiency and a desire to
advance all the information they had.
There are a few recommendations in our
report to which I should like to briefly refer.
As to the fourth recommendation, it was the
feeling of the committee that any services
producing revenue, such as the operation of
the Grain Board and the Wheat Board, should
be made pretty well self-sustaining.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The fifth recommendation
is another in which I am particularly interested. It has to do with the payment of
various subsidies from the federal treasury.
Speaking for myself, I believe that the principle of subsidies is absolutely wrong, and
the recommendation of the committee is to
the effect that every effort should be made
to continue the policy of reducing such subsidies. I am not entirely satisfied that any
polic3a as to the reducing of subsidies actually
exists; and if there is not, I think the government should devote itself to the examination
of the subsidies we now have-I am not just
alluding to the subsidies under the Department of Trade and Commerce. I had some
knowledge of subsidies some ten years ago,
and I believe that the principle behind the
payment of subsidies is unsound. The committee was agreed that the policy of reducing
subsidies both in amount and number should
be continued, and that payments under them
should be made only in cases of extreme
urgency.
The sixth recommendation in the report
has to do with national defence. My honourable friend, the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), said yesterday or the day beforeHon. Mr. Haig: It was the day before.
Hon. Mr. Euler: -that whereas the newspapers report that we are spending $450
million on our defence departments this year,
the estimates indicate that the actual figure
is nearer $650 million. I think perhaps he
is exaggerating a little, because I doubt
whether another $200 million for defence purposes are hidden in the estimates of other
departments. But those estimates covering
such things as arsenals and certain activities
of the Research Council should be made clear
to the public. They have the right to know
precisely what our total expenditure is for
defence and war preparation. If it is $650
million rather than $450 million, then it is
in the interests of our people that they should
be so informed.
The only other item to which I will refer
deals with our trade with the West Indies.
Attention is called to the fact that much

SENATE
difficulty has been encountered in the development and maintenance of our trade with these
colonies. As they belong to Great Britain,
perhaps we know where to lay the blame; but
certainly prohibitory measures are put into
force in the West Indies to prevent Canadian
goods from going there. This situation should
be corrected. The greatest obstacle in the
way of better trading conditions with West
Indies and certain other countries is that we
have not got much control over non-convertible currency.
I might agree with the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) that a record should be kept of
the proceedings of the various committees
which deal with estimates; but I doubt that
a verbatim record is necessary, because some
of the matters dealt with in committee are
relatively unimportant. I should think that
if the proceedings of every one of these committees are to be stenographically reported,
the Hansard staff will have to be considerably
increased.
Hon. W. A. Fraser: Honourable senators, I
cannot refrain at this time from adding a
word or two to the remarks of the honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) who mentioned two members of the
Civil Service.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Three.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: I believe it is incumbent
upon this honourable body to recognize the
fact that in this dominion we have the highest type of senior civil servants to be found
in the commonwealth.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fraser: It has been my privilege
for twenty-five or thirty years to know
intimately and to work with many deputy
ministers and other members of the Civil
Service of Canada, and at this time I wish
to take advantage of the opportunity to
express my appreciation to them. Many of
these gentlemen could obtain far higher
salaries in the employ of large corporations,
but they have chosen to dedicate their ability
and education to the service of the people.
I feel that it is a good thing to place on the
records of this honourable body our appreciation of the efficiency and integrity of our
senior civil servants, to whom we owe so
much for the proper administration of public
affairs in this country.
Also, I heartily endorse the sentiments
expressed by the honourable senator from
Waterloo as to the Senate. I agree that the
people of Canada are not aware of the
responsibility and the function of this house
in exercising a check and double check upon
the legislation passed by parliament.

However, my principal reason for interrupting the debate on the committee's report
-for which I trust I shall be forgiven-was
to say a few words in recognition of the
important part played by our senior civil
servants in the national and international
affairs of this nation.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this afternoon we have had for the first time
the privilege of considering the reports of
two of the standing committees to which certain estimates were referred for consideration, and I think that perhaps this would not
be an inappropriate time to make a brief
review of what the committees have done.
Every honourable senator present this afternoon will have recognized the care which the
committees have given to the examination
of these estimates. That is evident from the
interesting recommendations and the other
matter contained in the valuable reports that
the committee chairmen have presented to us.
I fully agree with the honourable leader
on the other side (Hon. Mr. Haig) as to the
need for greater public knowledge of the
operation of our parliamentary system. It
occurs to me now, as it occurred to me when
the estimates were referred to standing committees, that this method of examining into
public expenditures may have its effect in
making clearer to the people the way in
which the business of the country is carried
on. Certainly, if it has done nothing else,
it has had the effect of giving us in the
Senate a much better idea of how our public
affairs are conducted and the manner in
which our money is spent.
I think that it has also had an extremely
good effect upon senior civil servants themselves. I believe they welcome the opportunity to appear-informally, if you likebefore any committee of this house and to
tell that committee-and through it the public-about the duties with which they are
charged and their methods of expending the
moneys that parliament has entrusted to their
care. That in itself, it seems to me, is justification for the setting up of these committees, and I hope that the practice will be
continued in future years. Of course, what
we did this year was to some degree an
experiment. We all live and learn, and very
likely as time goes on the committees will
improve upon even their good work of this
session.
Several speakers this afternoon have recommended, as does at least one of the reports
before us-and I understand that the reports
of other committees will do the same-that
the day to day proceedings of the committees
be stenographically reported and printed. That
is a matter which will have to be considered

JUNE 22, 1950
next session, but it seems to me that in al
probability this chamber in its wisdom will
reach the conclusion that the information
obtained by the committees is so valuabie as
to make a verbatim record worth while.
I have only one further word to say, and
that is in reference ta the remarks made by
the honourable senator who immediately preceded me (Hon. Mr. Fraser). I thoroughiy
agree with what he said about the calibre of
the senior members of aur federal civil service. May I, by way of example, refer to an
experience that I had some years ago as a
practising lawyer? I happened ta be acting
as counsel for a large flrm of investment
bankers in New York who had purchased a
substantial issue of Canadian Government
securities, payable in the United States, which
they were proposing ta market in that country.
As honourable senators know, the law of the
United States requires that securities off ered
for public sale there be accompanied by a
substantial prospectus giving numerous details
about the financial status of the borrower.
This particular case required that a number
o! officiais from the banking house corne to
Ottawa and spend two or three months going
through the variaus government departments
coilating masses of information to be included
in the prospectus for the sale of the securities
in the United States. At the conclusion of
their stay in Ottawa these gentlemen from
New York came ta me and said how delighted
,they were with the co-operation they had
received from the senior officials here. They
remarked that they had neyer realized that
government officiais would put themselves
out as they did, giving their time, mornîng,
noon and night, regardiess of the inconvenience. Perhaps I should not repeat a
further remark they made, but I wili do so.
They added: "We would never have received
that service in Washington".
I was very
pleased ta hear them express these sentiments,
because ta me it was a practical demonstration
of the high quality of senior government
officiais at Ottawa. I affer that illustration
simply for the purpose a! emphasizing what
my honourable friend said a few moments ago.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators, I
f eel that I must say a word at this time on
behaif of government officiais in the United
States.
I have often visited Washington,
particularly during the war years, and I have
always received wonderful co-operation from
the public servants in that capital. Perhaps
the service they gave me was no better than
I receive here, but it was equally as good. I
was taken into the departments I visited, and
introduced, and ail possible information was
placed at my disposai. I therefore wish ta
commend the government officiais of that
55950-37J

country for the complete co-operation they
have afforded me on my visits ta Washington.
The motion was agreed ta.

CONVENTION 0F NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION

The Senate resurned from Wednesday, June
7, the adjourned debate on the motion o!
Hon. Mr. Euler:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by the United States of America of a Con-

vention of delegates fromn the demnocracies whlch
sponsored the North Atlantic treaty and representing the principal political parties of such demnoc-

racles, for the purpose of exploring how far their
peoples and the peoples of such other demnocracies
as the Convention may Invite to send delegates, can
apply amnong thema within the framnework of the
United Nations, the principles of federal union.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do flot propose ta make a lengthy address
at this time, but the mare I think about this
subject the more 1 am irnpressed with its
importance.
I think it was the honourable senator
!rom Churchill (Han. Mr. Crerar) who said
that we were passing through very difficuit
tirnes. 1 do not wish ta induige in an
enumeration of aur difficulties, but I strongly
believe that Russia will neyer attack other
nations of the world so long als they are
properly prepared and deterrnined ta resîst
such an attack. But an attack may corne
because of differences of opinion among the
other nations of the world, or because o! sorne
unexpected accident that may upset the
equilibrium cf international affairs.
I was a !uil-gra wn man during the war cf
1914-18, and I know that while many people
f elt that that confiict could have been
avoided, some regarded it as inevitable.
As ta the second World War, I arn positive
that Hitler's army would neyer have attacked
the democratic countries had they been ready
for such an attack Anyone familiar with the
world of 1939 could not but realize that there
was only one great army in the worldHitler's. Ivuch the same situation faces the
warld of today.

SENATE
I have always believed that the German people did not go to war for the sake of going to
war, and today I do not believe that the Russian people want to go to war for the sake of
going to war. But nations get themselves into
a position where it is impossible for them to
withdraw. As was pointed out by the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), there is always great difficulty in
getting men and women to surrender their
national rights. For myself, I support the
province of Manitoba; in fact, I stick up for
Winnipeg, which I know is not the greatest
city in the world.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is very nearly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And I know that Manitoba
is not the greatest province in CanadaHon. Mr. Euler: It is the wettest, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -but I still love it, and it
is hard for me to admit that the people of
my province can do any wrong. The same
principle applies with respect to nations. We
all love Canada, especially when we reach the
stage of life at which we become members of
the Senate of Canada. We regard Canada as
we do for two reasons: first, because luck has
seemingly been with us and we have lived
a good life, and second-and this is the
fundamental reason-because we believe that
it was our country which gave us the things
we enjoy. I would bring the minds of honourable members back to September 9, 1939,
when we stood up in this house and voted
to go to war. Let no one be under the
impression that every senator did not know
what he was doing, or that what moved him
was not his love of Canada. We all realized
that going to war meant sending many young
men to their death, or to be crippled or
maimed for life. But knowing all that, and
knowing that Canada was facing a crisis and
that a decision had to be made, we stood up
in this bouse and voted unanimously in
favour or going to war.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), who moved this resolution,
is a good businessman, and if he were asked
whether it was a good business proposition
to establish a federal union of the Atlantic
nations he might say that it was not. But
in matters of war we are not concerned with
good business practices. My honourable
(Hon. Mr.
friend from Toronto-Trinity
Roebuck) referred the other day to the human
element which enters into the waging of war,
and when that is considered nothing else is of
any value. I say without fear of contradiction that when one member of a family joins
the armed forces, the thoughts of the parents
are always with that young man, regardless
of the needs of the rest of the family.

If that is true, and I believe it is, we
should do everything we can to avoid another war. We are spending large amounts
Our
of money on military preparations.
whole economie life is being geared to meet
that eventuality. We are bound to do everything possible to show Russia-I mention
that nation openly, because it is the only
one from whom aggressive war may be
feared-that we ourselves do not want war
at all. I do not suppose there is a nation
in the world which has a greater abhorrence
of war and yet is more ready to spend
money, endeavour, and indeed manpower,
to defend the principles that it believes to
be right, than Canada.
I am in hearty accord with the sentiments
of the mover of this resolution. It may not
be possible to bring the democracies together; even though they meet, they may
not agree; but every Canadian believes that
if it is possible to apply the principles of
federal union to the democracies, and if
that organization might tip the scales against
the recurrence of war, we should strive to
bring it into being. It is from that point
of view that I regard this resolution. I am
not an optimist; I do not know whether union
can be achieved; but I frankly admit that
I did not believe that the project for an
Atlantic charter would be successful. I voted
for it in this house, but, as the saying is,
with my tongue in my cheek. I hoped for its
success, but my hard business sense suggested
serious doubts; and from a practical standpoint I did not think it was possible. I
feel much the same about the motion now
before us. In the case of the Atlantic
charter 1, in common with many other people,
was wrong. The seven members of the
original organization have added to their
number and encouraged us to believe that
their efforts will succeed.
I am wholly in favour of having this
meeting called by the United States. A
distinguished visitor from that country was
here the other day, and some of us had
a chat with him. I then said that I thought
that if Canada were to join in extending
this invitation the prospects of acceptance
would be improved. By that I meant, not
that friendship to the United States or Canada
would be increased thereby, but that any
sense of constraint might be removed. I
am reminded of a personal experience at the
meeting of the United Nations in 1946. The
meeting had been going on about six weeks
when one of the delegates of Iran, an associate on the legal committee, invited me to
have lunch with him. I did so. It was
a lovely day, and we went out and sat
on the terrace. My host said, "I would like

JUNE 22, 1950
to ask you, as one of the Canadian representatives, a very personal question. Do you
people trust the United States?"
I said:
"My dear sir, we flot only trust them, we
have always trusted them. We have lived
alongside of them for about a hundred and
twenty-five years. Our common frontier is
some four thousand miles long, and the only
people we have to guard it are the officiais
charged with the prevention of smugglingthough some smuggling does go on now and
again. We trust .them absolutely; and because there is wholehearted trust between
us we are able to tell them what we really
think about what they are doing; they know
that what we say is exactly what we think;
and they speak in the samne fashion to us."
If a nation of thirteen or fourteen millions
can maintain these friendly and confidential.
relations with a nation having ten times its
population and probably twenty times its
wealth and power, is there flot reason for
hoping that others will copy our example?
I shall vote for this resolution and do
my best in every way to make it a reality.
Whoever has the honour to represent this
house at the convention will, I believe, be
fortified with the knowledge that the Senate

is wholeheartedly behind the attempt to prevent by this means another cri-is in world
affairs. The task is a difficuit one; there
may be failures; but it we do not try, no
solution will be possible.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson the
debate was adjourned.

OFFICIAL SECRETS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bil 309, an Act to amend
the Official Secrets Act.
The bill was read the first time.
THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON EXTERNAL
RELATIONS

Hon. A. K. Hugessen (for Hon. Mr. Gouin)
presented the report of the Standing Committee on External Relations, to whom were
referred certain estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1951.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant,
as follows:
Your committee held three sittings during the
course of which were heard the Under Secretary of
State for External Affairs, Mr. A. D. P. Heeney, the
Deputy Under Secretary, Mr. Leon Mayrand, and the
Chief Administrative Officer, Mr. G. D. Hemsley.
All the questions put by the members of your conmittee were fully answered, very interesting explanations were given by the witnesses and written
statements were also filed to cover various points.
After having duly considered the evidence thus
submitted, your committee begs to make the following recommendations:
No. of Vote 64, Departmental Administration;
Details of Services 559.
"Publicity and Information-$103,600."
In addition to amounts thus specifically disbursed,
it appears that 51 employees of the department
devote their time in whole or in part to publicity
and information. By allotting a proportionate part
of their salary to this item, the total expenses for
publicity and information to be charged to External
Affairs would amount to $226,400.
Your committee is of the opinion that the expenses
incurred by the government in general for publicity
and information should be reduced to a strict minimum and that this specially applies to External
Affairs. A substantial part of such expenses is
necessary, some are also really of benefit to Canada,
but it would be worth while to scrutinize the possibility of eliminating publicity expenses which have
little or no practical value. Considerable savings
may possibly be realized through the establishment
of a bureau centralizing all publicity undertaken by
the government and the study of the advantages and
disadvantages resulting from the establishment of
such a central publicity bureau is recommended.
No. of Vote 65: Representation abroad
Details of Services 667
"Allowances, $1,131,637."
Your committee is anxious that the diplomats
representing Canada abroad and their staff receive

a remuneration enabling them to do things properly
in order to maintain and increase the prestige
enjoyed by our country abroad. It must be realized
however that Canada is not a big power and that a
proper sense of modesty is quite compatible with
our external representation. The system of payment
of allowances should be studied for the purpose of
exercising a proper control over the expenses incurred for the sums thus voted for allowances and for
all practical purposes being supplements to the
salaries paid.
To Build or Purchase Premises for Offices or
Residences for Missions Abroad, etc.-$165,000.
This item should be considered together with
vote 67, which reads as follows:
To authorize the use during the fiscal year 1950-51
in payment for the acquisition, improvement or
furnishing of properties for Canadian Government
offices and residences in foreign countries of inconvertible foreign currencies from deposits of such
currencies which may be used only for governmental or other limited purposes in these countries
and which have been received by the Government
of Canada from other governments in settlement of
claims arising out of military operations or war
expenditures (p. 10), $1.00.
It is obvious that decent premises must be provided for our missions abroad, but a policy of
reasonable economy is again compatible with the
standing of our country. Care must be taken to
avoid any extravagance or lavishness which would
be contrary to our well-known national habits and
customs.
Few properties have been acquired abroad up to
date and your committee favours such a slow and
gradual process of acquisition. It is realized however that exceptional opportunities may be offered
in Europe under the present post-war conditions.
This point forms part of the problem arising out of
our above mentioned frozen credits in foreign countries. Now that the extent of such credits is being
determined, the amounts to be used out of such
inconvertible deposits in foreign currencies should
properly be indicated in the estimates. It will thus
be possible to eliminate the anomaly created by the
system existing under Vote No. 67; a mention of a
nominal amount of $1.00 now enables the department
to obtain several hundred thousand dollars at the
discretion of the government and of the Treasury
Board without any specific previous authorization
from Parliament.
Vote No. 70, Canadian Representation at International Conferences-$225,000.
It is recommended that this item appearing in the
estimates for External Affairs be grouped with the
substantial amounts also incurred for representation
at international conferences and charged to Trade
and Commerce, Labour, etc. Thus the total amount
incurred for representation at international conferences would be presented in a clear and simple
form. At the present time, the amounts disbursed
by the various departments for similar purposes are
presented only separately, without proper references
to the total amounts thus spent for the same object.
Vote No. 73, United Nations Organization, $1,343,700.
The assessment levied on Canada seems to be out
of proportion to the amount now levied on certain
other countries, taking into consideration their
national income. It is hoped that a readjustment
of our assessment may in due time be secured.
Your committee recognizes however that our
active support of United Nations is a fundamental
basis of our foreign policy. In spite of its deficiencies, it is realized that United Nations is the
only international organization now in existence
and designed for the prevention of war.

JUNE 23, 1950
Your committee considers that our diplomatic
service is a great credit to our country and that the
part played by our representatives at Lake Success
and at other International conferences has been
sincerely directed to the peace of the world.

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Next sitting.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Before the
orders of the day are proceeded with, I
would suggest to the house that we adjourn
not later than 12 o'clock in order that certain
matters before the Banking and Commerce
Committee can be considered between noon
and the lunch hour, and that we reassemble
at 3 o'clock to carry on the business of the
house.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
STATUTE LAW BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 313, an Act to amend The
Statute Law.
He said: As the house is aware and those
honourable senators who are members of
the legal profession are particularly aware,
under the general law of this country at the
present time any subject who desires to
bring suit against the Crown must, as a
prerequisite to such suit, obtain the permission of the Department of Justice through
a fiat issued by the Governor General. That
principle, unless modified by legislation,
applies also to all agencies of the Crown,
including those numerous boards, commissions, and other bodies which over the past
few years, have been set up and which are
apt to continuously increase in number as
the operations of the federal government in
various branches of the activities of the
country continue to expand. In the case of
,certain of these agencies which have beenconstituted by statute a provision in varying
forms has been inserted which permits a
subject to sue the agency without the
necessity of obtaining a fiat; and the purpose
of this legislation is to standardize that
procedure in respect of the corporations
where that right has already been granted
by statute, and to add a number of corporations in respect of which such right
does not now exist.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is such a suit commenced in the ordinary courts or in the
Exchequer Court? I understand that if you
obtain a fiat you must sue in the Exchequer
Court; is that not correct?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think so. I
speak subject to correction, but my understanding is that these provisions are intended
to protect the subject in respect of suits he
may take in any court throughout the land,
whether it be a provincial or a federal court.
The bill is comprised of seventeen sections
which are phrased more or less in the same
language. These sections incorporate a standard form in the following wording:
Actions, suits or other legal proceedings in respect
of any right or obligation acquired or incurred by
the commission-

or by the director or the board, or whatever
it may be,
-on

behalf of His Majesty, whether in its name or

in the narne of His Majesty, may be

(a) brought or taken against the commission,

without the Governor General's fiat ...

Although the bill contains seventeen sections, they are all substantially the same,
except that they are applicable to and will be
included in seventeen different statutes, each
of which sets up one of these Crown organizations or bodies. The first ten sections
introduce this clause into various statutory
provisions in which at the present time it
does not appear at all; the remaining seven
sections, from 11 to 17 inclusive, amend
provisions which are now contained in the
relevant statutes in order to make them conform to the general provision which is contained in every section of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask a question,
which really has something to do with the
one asked by the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)? My interpretation of the bill is that a person will no longer
need a fiat.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In the first ten cases,
yes; but in the others it merely changes the
existing legislation to bring it into harmony
with the general form of the section provided
for the purpose.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I agree with your answer;
but would that not mean that in cases where
you formerly had to sue in the Exchequer
Court you still would have to sue in that
court, and that in cases where you previously
could sue in the ordinary courts you will
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Would the honourable still sue in those courts, provided you have a
gentleman explain one point? He says that fiat? The law is not changed in that respect?

courts having the right to deal with certain

SENATE
cases. If a subject wished to sue in the
Exchequer Court in, say a shipping matter, he
could still do it in that court, and if he
desired to sue in the provincial courts he
could do so; and in either case without
obtaining a fiat.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, that is my understanding from reading the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know that
there are any other observations I need make
to familiarize honourable senators with the
bill. Although it is fairly lengthy, it is
quite simple, and I think its general purpose
will appeal strongly to honourable senators
just as it did to members of the other house,
where the measure was passed unanimously.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I have written down a
question so as to be able to clearly express
what I have in mind. Under this legislation
would it be possible, without a fiat, to sue any
of the corporations mentioned in the bill for
injury or damage or false arrest resulting
from negligence on the part of an officer or
employee of the corporation or is the bill
limited entirely to property matters?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What the bill refers to
in every section is, "Actions, suits or other
legal proceedings in respect of any right or
obligation acquired or incurred by the commission", or by the board or corporation, as
the case may be. It seems to me that that
would cover any kind of claim, whether
for damages, false arrest or anything else.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I have been advised
that it would not. Suppose an employee
of one of these corporations while acting in
the course of his duties as driver of a truck
or car belonging to the corporation ran
down someone on the street, could proceedings be taken without a fiat? I have been
led to believe that they could not.

we ought to be perfectly clear that in such
a case the injured person would have a right
to sue the Crown company.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Without a fiat.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Without a fiat. My understanding all along has been that that was
intended to be the effect of this bill, but
subsection (2a) of Section 4 seems to be
a bit obscure or involved. That may be
because I am not a lawyer, but at any
rate I hope the bill will be sent to a committee where we can have the advice of, for
instance, the Law Clerk of the Senate, as
to the precise meaning of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) informs me that in
anticipation of such questions as these being
raised he had intended to request that the
bill be sent to a standing committee; and
he arranged that, if this were done, officials
from the Department of Justice would be
present to clarify the proposed changes in
the Act.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I think that is very
important, because the bill makes no change
in the law as ýto the responsibility of the
Crown. The only thing the bill does is to
permit an aggrieved person to take action
against a Crown corporation without a fiat.
In the past a fiat has been necessary, but often
when application was made for one the Department of Justice took the stand that the
Crown was not responsible for the action of
an employee of a Crown company, and consequently proceedings could be taken only under
section 19C of the Exchequer Court Act. This
bill makes no change in the law as to the
responsibility of the Crown for anything done
by its servants in the course of their duties.
I think it would be well to clarify the point
as to whether the bill provides a change in the
responsibility of the Crown or merely a
change in procedure.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should be very much
surprised if my honourable friend was right
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask my honourin that, but I am frank to say that I have able friend if in the past the employees of

Man. Mr. Haig: 1 agree with the honourable

is a &ng march forward. I corngratulate the

Soin. Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is appropriate to present

as the honourable member for Toronto-Trinity appears to be, that the trend should be
pursued further, though I may change my
opinion later on.
In answer to a question raised during the

allowances for travelling expenses.
As honourable senators are aware, the
British North America Act provides that
provincial legislatures shail create the provincial courts and designate the number of judges
that are to sit in such courts. The federal
government then has the power of appointing those judges and the responsibiiity of
paying them. The three provinces I have
mentioned have passed legislation which
requires the appointment of additional judges
to the bench. The Superior Court of British
Columbia has been amended to increase the
number of judges in that province from six
to seven, and section 1 of this bill wouid provide for the saiary of the additional judge.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not know whether I
can put my question in a clearer way. If I
were a judge going to a city, say, Toronto,
I would be allowed $12 a day while travelling there.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It means $12 a day while
there.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It may be that too, but
clause (iii) provides that the sum of $12
shall be paid during the time a judge is
accommodated at a city.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It means attending at
a city and not travelling to a city.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why is there a difference
of $4 between the allowance paid to a judge
while travelling to a city and that paid when
travelling to a place that is not a city?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not think it is a
difference in the travelling allowance, but a
difference in the allowance for accommodation
at the place where the judge is attending.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
this seems to be a simple matter. Judges are
paid travelling allowances to cover their
expenses when they leave the place where
they reside for the place where they are to sit
on the bench. For example, a judge residing
in Quebec city is paid his travelling expenses
to Montreal if he is going to sit there, and
this bill would increase from $10 to $12 a day
the expense allowance he would receive during his stay in Montreal.
This is a move in the right direction, but I
cannot see why judges should have to pay
any money out of their own pockets when
they are called upon to sit at any place. When
I was admitted to the Bar, thirty years ago,
judges were allowed $10 a day living
expenses, and at that time a judge could
obtain a good room at the Chateau Frontenac
for as little as $3 a day, and his meals cost
about $5 a day. Nowadays, however, a judge
-whether he is an Appeal Court judge from
Montreal sitting in the city of Quebec or an
Appeal Court judge from the city of Quebec
sitting in Montreal-cannot get by on less
than $25 a day. He cannot get accommodation
at any decent hotel in Quebec or Montreal
for less than $8 or $9, and this does not
include his meals nor tips. I think everyone
will agree that a person cannot get three
good meals in any hotel in Quebec, Montreal
or in Ottawa without spending $6 or $7 a day.
As I say the government bas made a move
in the right direction but I do not see why it
will not pay the entire expenses of a judge
who bas to go from one place to another. Why
should a judge on a taxable income of
$12,000 a year be obliged to pay anywhere
from $5 to $10 a day out of his own pocket to

cover his expenses when on duty? Is a judge
of less importance than a senior civil servant?
The department having for the first time in
thirty years recommended an increase in the
expense allowance of judges, I cannot see why
it did not suggest that the allowance be fixed
at $25 a day or the amount of actual
expenditure.
Hon. Mr. Duff: That would be better.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It should be either one
or the other. I do not think a judge should
make any profit out of his expense account,
but he should receive at least the full amount
that he spends for accommodation when
attending at a court away from home. I congratulate the department upon proposing at
least some increase in the allowance, but I do
not think it is enough. If the Senate had the
power to increase a money vote I would move,
in amendment, that the allowance be the
amount actually spent.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In case anyone thinks that
I am opposed to an increase in the expense
allowances for judges, I wish to make it clear
that my only purpose in asking the question
was to find out why the allowance should be
$12 a day if a judge is staying in a city but
only $8 if he stays in a town or village.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think the principle of
the bill is wrong, because a judge might very
well have to spend more for accommodation
in the country than in a city. This bill
insinuates that the standard of living in
country districts is lower and cheaper than in
cities. The allowance should be the same,
regardless of where the judge stays.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Let us amend the bill
to provide that judges be reimbursed the
actual amount of their out of pocket expenses.
Hon. Mr. Doone: May I ask the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) if there is any
federal legislation defining "city"? I am confident that many provinces have no statutory
definition of the word.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friends
are looking to me for so much legal advice
that I find myself in sohe difflculty. I think
the purpose in providing for allowances
of different amounts is to enable the Minister
of Justice to see to it that no unduly high
or unduly low amount is approved for
expenses. I am not quite sure that the honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) was right in suggesting that living expenses may not be higher in cities than
in other parts of the country. In any event,
the bill would not establish any new principle, as for some considerable time the
amount of a judge's expense allowance has

JUNE 23, 1950
depended upon whether or not he stayed in a
city. The bill merely increases the amounts
of the allowances.
As to the point raised by the honourable
gentleman from Granville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), I do not know whether the Senate
would have the right to entertain any amendment that would have the effect of making
the allowances still larger, but perhaps this
question could be submitted to officials of
the Department of Justice, who within a
few minutes will be appearing before our
Banking and Commerce Committee when it
is considering another bill. I would therefore suggest that this bill also, after receiving
second reading, might be referred to that
committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
without the Act itself before me I find it
difficult to understand how the bill increases
the number of county court judges in Ontario
by one, as the honourable gentleman who
explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Robertson) said
it does. But if it does that, the addition is
not large enough. My recent knowledge of
courts in Toronto is that they are much
overworked and away behind in their
schedules. That being so, I cannot understand why only one additional judge is being
asked for.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is that not a question for
the government of Ontario? The federal
parliament authorizes appointment of judges
only after the necessary provincial legislation has been passed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true. The first
step in the procedure is the passage of an
Act by the province, as I know, for on one
occasion when I was Attorney General of
Ontario I introduced in the legislature a bill
to increase the number of judges by two.
The point I am making now is simply this,
that in recent years the business of our courts
has increased so greatly that one additional
judge at this time is not enough.
I also wish to comment briefly on the proposed increase in the expense allowances for
judges. I am a long way from thinking that
our judges should be treated parsimoniously.
Indeed, I feel they should be generously paid,
for their work is important and they should
never be placed in financial difficulties as a
result of undertaking it. But as to expenses,
it may be that a judge staying in a large
city will not find the allowance of $12 a day
sufficient if he must go to the best hotel there
and take a suite.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Or even a room.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: His home and family
have to be maintained when he is away, so
there is no drop in his expenses.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, yes, there is, to the
extent of his personal living expenses. When
I am home I find it just as impossible as
when I am away to prevent 25-cent pieces
from dripping out of my pocket. The judge
has to bear his personal expenses when in his
own municipality, but when he takes court
elsewhere he is paid an amount that is supposed to cover them. There is also the
question whether it is necessary for a judge
always to go to the most expensive hotel in a
large city.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In another thirty years
the allowance may be increased to $15 a day.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the last few months
some of our committees have been examining
public accounts with a view to bringing about
economy in expenditures, and not infrequently we have criticised departments for
being too generous, or at least for not taking
sufficient care to see that money was not
wasted. I should not like the Senate to take
a strong stand in favour of increasing the
allowances proposed in the bill. The sum
paid out for travelling and living expenses is
already very high. In any event, the Senate
has no authority to increase the amount of
a money vote, and I am sure my honourable
friend did not mean to suggest that it had.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: His point was that if
the Senate had such authority he would move
an amendment to the bill. Our judges should
be properly remunerated, and fully compensated for expenditures that they are required
to make in the course of their duties; but I
think we should hesitate before proposing any
increase in the allowances set out in the bill.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators, as
I am not a lawyer, I perhaps should keep out
of this debate, but I wish to say a word
on one point raised by the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I think a Supreme Court judge who
is required to leave home in order to preside
over a court in another city out of town has
a duty to stay at a first-class hotel there.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It is my opinion that if
he stayed at a second-rate hotel he would
lower his dignity and people would criticise
him for it. I would support a recommendaHon. Mr. Roebuck: Or even a room. But tion that a judge be allowed the full amount

through performance of their official duties;
but as their accounts would be checked by
auditors, as all other accounts are, there
would be no waste of money. In any event,
we should uphold the dignity of judges by at
least supporting the increase in allowances
proposed by the bill.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators,The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator
from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
McLean) was on his feet while the Clerk
Assistant was announcing second reading of
the bill, but he was not recognized. I suggest
that he be allowed to speak.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson: The bill has now been
given second reading, and if no honourable
senator wishes it to go to a committee, I shall
now move that the bill be now read a third
time, and the honourable gentleman will be
quite at liberty to speak on my motion.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
I assure you that my remarks will be brief.
In the Public Accounts I see items averaging, perhaps, $20 a day for the expenses of
lawyers serving royal commissions and other
departments of the federal service. This
would suggest to me that these lawyers stay
at the best hotels, and I see no reason why
Supreme Court judges should not enjoy
equally good accommodation. I entirely agree
with the senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McKeen), that the judges should not be
expected to stay at second-rate hotels. Some
of us frequently find that the best suites in
hotels are taken by persons employed on
royal cómmissions.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That only happens in
Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would point out to the
honourable senator from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) that many judges do little
travelling.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The judges of the
Supreme Court of Canada certainly do not
travel.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the province of Manitoba
there are about five municipal centres, each
of which is visited three times a year by a
judge of the King's Bench. Apart from those
fifteen trips, the judges are sitting in the city
of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The county court judges
in that province must do some travelling.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For the most part they
stay at home and look after their local courts.

Manitoba, like Saskatchewan, has an overabundance of county court judges. Of coursein Saskatchewan the county court judges
rarely sit.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The people of that province are law-abiding citizens.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They may be law-abiding
citizens, but if they do not want to pay their
bills there is no use suing them.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Unlike the people of
Manitoba, we pay our debts.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Minister of Justice
practised law in the province of Manitoba,
and because of his familiarity with conditions there I do not think for a minute that
he would be over-generous towards the
judges in that province.
I say to the economists in this house that
we cannot be too generous in the matter of
travelling expenses for our judges. If I were
a judge living in Winnipeg and had to attend
a court in Brandon, I would certainly want
to stay at the Canadian National hotel; and
I think it would be my duty to stay there.
Also, in my opinion Canada does not pay her
judges any too much. Certainly the lawyers
know how much better it is for a litigant to
have his case tried by a good judge than by
a poor one. I do not suggest that there are
many poor judges, but my honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
will agree with me that when such a judge
is scheduled to hear an important case, in
order to avoid him counsel conveniently gets
sick. For my part, I am not worried about
being over-generous with our judges.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Well, I am.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I believe that the judges
should stay at such hotels as the Prince
Albert in Brandon, the Saskatchewan at
Regina, the Bessborough at Saskatoon and
the Macdonald at Edmonton. For the reasons
stated, I heartily support the bill.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I am pleased to hear the honourable
leader of the opposition speak as he has concerning the travelling expenses of judges.
The only point to which I would draw his
attention is that in Quebec the judges do a
great deal of travelling.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know they do.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: By law the judges have
to live in the cities of Quebec and Montreal,
and travel out to the smaller centres in the
province. For instance ten days out of each
month one of the judges from Quebec City
is in Chicoutimi, Roberval, Abitibi and other
provincial centres. The courts of appeal sit
in Quebec City and in Montreal about the

JUNE 23, 1950
same time each month, and three judges from
Montreal go to Quebec City for ten days out
of the month, and two judges from Quebec
go to Montreal for ten or fifteen days each
month. In that way the appeal court judges
in the province of Quebec do considerable
travelling, and in my opinion they spend out
of their salaries at least $5 a day for hotel
expenses.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The economist is always
an unpopular fellow, and I would not want
anyone to think that in my opinion $12 a day
is too generous an allowance. On the other
hand, I believe that $30 a day would be a public scandal.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Pay the actual cost.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I agree with the senator
from Grandville that we should pay just
the amount expended, and that there should
be no arbitrary distinction between expense
allowances in towns and in cities except as
justified by the facts.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Honourable senators,
I do not think we should make the office of
a judge any more attractive than it is at the
present time. As I see it, every time a vacancy
occurs on the Bench half the lawyers in the
province are candidates for the position
and there is difficulty in making a suitable
selection.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if that condition also applies to
senators in his province?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
At 1 o'clock the Senate took recess.

At 3 o'clock the sitting was resumed.

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
CONCURRED IN
The Senate proceeded to consideration of

the report of the Standing Committee on
Finance, to whom w'ere referred certain
estimates.
Hon. T. A. Crerar moved concurrence in the
report.

He said: Honourable senators, I shall not
detain the house more than a few minutes,
because I have a very important engagement
which necessitates my absence from the
chamber as soon as it is practicable for me
to leave. It is not necessary to deal at any
length with this report. It is printed in the
Minutes of the Proceedings of the house. I
assume that all my colleagues have read it
and are prepared to criticize or to commend
it. However, I should like to make a few
observations.
First, as chairman, I would express my
thanks to the committee for the attention it
gave to the consideration of the estimates
assigned to it. In all my experience I cannot
recall a committee whose approach to the
consideration of any matter was more objective than that of this committee. It discharged its duties in a manner wholly in
keeping with the purpose of the second
chamber in our parliament.
This report contains recommendations on
matters outside the particular estimates as to
which the Senate on May 8 granted the committee authority to secure certain statistical
information. I venture to hope, however, that

SENATE
the government will take some of these suggestions into consideration; and without
wanting to glorify this report the members of
the committee would be delighted if the government would act upon our proposals.
I am sure honourable senators agree that
taxation is a most important function of any
democratic government. It has always been
my opinion that nothing is more important in
the operation of federal, provincial or municipal governments than knowing how public
moneys are secured and spent. It seems to
me that public bodies are obligated to spend
their moneys as efficiently and economically
as possible. If taxation gets too heavy in all
spheres of government, then it causes too
much of a drain on the productive power of
the country. If this should happen in Canada it would unquestionably interfere with
further development of our productive power.
We should be careful to see that this does not
happen in Canada, a country which is blessed
with vast resources and immense possibilities
for providing those things which are necessary to an enlightened and happy people.
I have no further remarks to make in asking the house to approve this report, but I
should like to reserve the right to close the
debate if any honourable colleague who was
not a member of 'the Finance Committee
should throw brickbats at the report. If the
honourable member from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) does not take objection to the
report, I think it will pass without any
difficulty.
Some Hon. Senalors:

Hear, hear.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I had the honour of serving on the Finance
Committee, but I must confess that the committee members acted in a true Anglo-Saxon
way. We were all quite willing to attend
the meetings, but when the time came for
drawing up a report everyone wanted to leave
it to somebody else. The chairman then took
over these duties himself, and he really
deserves a great deal of credit for the splendid
job he did. During all my service in this
house I have never seen a better report.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

examination, nor in the questions that were
asked was there any evidence of anyone trying
to make political capital.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is all to the good. I
would ask the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) to urge the government to bring
down the estimates early again next session.
Then the gentlemen who served as committee
chairmen this year should get together to see
if the work of the committees could possibly
be improved. I am not criticizing anyone, but
I think it would be better if kindred subjects
were placed together under similar headings.
This would help to facilitate the handling
of the estimates. Further, as I have already
indicated, I think a verbatim report should
be made of the proceedings of the various
committee meetings.
The chairman of. the Finance Committee has
placed in Hansard an authentic report based
on the evidence of the officials of the Department of Finance and the Bureau of Statistics,
and this report will undoubtedly prove to be
a mine of information for anyone wishing to
investigate our various governmental expenditures. As I have stated already, I think a
great service would be performed if our high
school and university students could be given
a course in these governmental matters.
I agree with the honourable member from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that this committee, by its work, has made a valuable contribution to our voters and taxpayers, and the
public at large. Again I do not wish to
criticize anyone, but I think it would take a
chartered accountant to understand our blue
book of estimates, and I do not imagine our
committee would ever have been able to complete its work if it had not been for the
assistance of an official of the Department of
Finance.
In conclusion I want to say that the officials
who appeared before our committee are a
credit to the Civil Service of Canada.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to.

of Europe, is desirable, and feit that, if
necessary, a larger amount should be voted
for this overseas service.
The Citizenship Branch of the Department of Labour has, I think, done good work
ta date. It has co-operated with the provinces
by supplying educational and informational.
material, which is done only upon the request
and with the concurrence of the provinces.
We were told that in this way the branch
had supplied 300,000 pieces of literature, and
that newcomers to Canada had shown great
anxiety to learn. aur officiai languages as
soon as possible. It is estimated that the
cost ta the department of furnishing educational material averages about $20 for each
immigrant.
The Indian Affairs Branch reported a
marked increase in the facilities for education, and the schools have been greatly improved. We were informed that the new
twelve-room, school at Caughnawaga would
compare very favourably, bath as ta the
building and equipment, with a schaol af
similar size anywhere in the country.
The Labour Department has a number of
branches, I think eleven in ail, and it was
very difficuit for the committee to estimate
in dollars and cents the menit of mast of
these branches. We were told that many
days of work have been saved thraugh the
activities of the Labour Relations Board and
associated bodies.
The committee considered the administration of the Annuities Act, and it asks that a
careful study be made in order ta learn if
the Annuities Branch can be maintained on
an efficient basis without an increase in cost
ta the taxpayers.
The cammittee suggests -that as the Labour
Department is conducting vocational training, it might ýbe passible ta ca-ordinate this
service with the educatianal wark of the
Citizenship Branch, and thereby save administrative expenses.
I shauld like ta endarse the opinion expressed by the chairmen of ather committees
that valuable work has been done in the
study of the estimates. If estimates are
referred ta the Committee on Immigration
and Labour again next session, we should

studied by the Senate. I do not think anyone
feels that we ought to approach the estimates with the intention of suggesting reductions in the various items which have been
duly considered by the appropriate ministers,
but it does seem to me that anyone who
looks over the whole economy 'of the federal
civil service must realize that we have
reached the point where greater supervision
over expenditures will have to be exercised.
By way of reminding the bouse how the
service has expanded, I need only say that
in 1939 there were 46,106 employees, and
today there are almost 156,000. The total
annual expenditure of the government now
is $2,300 million, all of which cornes out of
the taxpayers and out of production. Good
work was done by the committees, but I
believe that, as a result of experience gained
through the examination of deputy ministers
and other officials who appeared before us,
we shall do even better work next session.
I said that there was one part of the
report to which I wish to direct attention.
That part has to do with The Annuities
Branch of the Department of Labour. I
believe that in a study of this branch the
Senate could do some very practical work,
and I hope that next year we shall put teeth
into our recommendations to the government.
I am not suggesting that we should engage
in carping criticism of the branch, but rather
that we endeavour to make constructive suggestions. It is well to remember that the
government needs some assistance in the
carrying on of its many activities, for our
economy has grown so greatly that a minister
cannot be expected to familiarize himself
with all the ramifications of the department
for which he is responsible. In the days when
the Annuities Act was passed the prevailing
economic philosophy was, "Let the devil take
the hindmost," and employers had no regard
for the welfare of those who worked for
them. The Act was intended by parliament
to be a means of helping people to make some
financial provision for their old age, and it
has served that purpose remarkably well.
But last year the government decided, after
an investigation, that in order to lower the
federal treasury's outlay for administration
of the scheme the price of annuities should
be increased, or-and this amounts to the
same thing-that the rate of interest allowed
on moneys paid in by the subscribers should
be reduced. The result was, as stated in the
committee's report, that the number of sales
decreased by about 50 per cent in the last
fiscal year, as compared with the previous
year.
My contention is that, whether we like it
or not, Canada, in common with most other
countries, is headed in the direction of the
welfare state. An interesting speech was

delivered in Britain last week by Lord Cecil.
He pointed out that the people of that
country-and I think the same thing can be
said of many people in Canada-are now
more concerned about the privileges they
enjoy in the welfare state than about individual freedom. They are not now protesting
against the dictatorship of bureaucratic
boards, but are concerned about security from
the cradle to the grave.
A special committee on Old Age Security
has functioned during this session of parliament, and Canada too is moving forward.
I quite realize that the reason for this kind
of progress is pressure from the people, who
today are more concerned about what the
welfare state is going to do for them in
their old age than what would happen if
an atomic bomb were let loose. I ask the
question: Should Canada continue to administer the Annuities Act? If the state is going
to provide old age security, why should the
Annuities Branch, since it bas lost fifty
per cent of its business, be carried on? I
am well aware that once the government
sets up an office, it is there for all timeit can hire but it can never fire.
While in Washington recently I was rather
interested to hear that an investigation in
the civil service in that city revealed that
one department with 250 employees did not
know what its job was, and was just marking
time and drawing pay.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It was lost.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is possible, perhaps, that
such a thing could happen amongst 400,000
civil servants; but I say that the Senate of
Canada should not be content to let government expenditures go unchallenged. It is
a well known fact that if a business concern
were running this country it could reduce the
public service by fifty per cent.
I ask those members of the Senate who
believe in free enterprise why they do not
protest that the government should not be
in the annuities business, especially since
any man or women can get practically the
same type of security from a business bouse?
Why should the government take money from
the exchequer to keep the annuities fund
solvent, when it is being asked to guarantee
that at 65 or 70 years of age everyone will
be provided for? In spite of the loss of
fifty per cent of the business of the Annuities
Branch, there has been no reduction in its
staff.
I draw the attention of the Senate to the
fact that, if we are to control and reduce
the expenditures of this country, we must
concern ourselves with the cost of maintaining such services as the Annuities Branch.
If there is any real reason why this branch

NATIONAL FILM BOARD BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 317, an Act respecting
the National Film Board.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill provides for an extensive reorganization of the
National Film Board.
The first notable production of films and
photography by the government occurred in
the Department of Trade and Commerce. As
early as 1914 the Exhibits and Publicity
Bureau of that department was authorized to
produce films and photographs to promote
external trade. In 1918 all other government departments were required to refer
their requests for films to this bureau for
advice.
In 1921, as the use of films by government
departments had continued to increase, it
was decided to set up the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau, under the
administration of the Department of Trade
and Commerce. This bureau was to be
exclusively concerned with the production of
films and photographs, and to take over the
duties previously performed by the Exhibit
and Publicity Bureau. For the next eighteen
years the Motion Picture Bureau continued
as the government film-producing agency,
but certain individual departments, after consultation with the bureau, contracted with
private firms for the supplying of films.
By 1939 it was evident that motion pictures, as an instrument of public policy, were
of prime importance in all departments and
agencies of government, and that there was
need for a co-ordinating and supervising
authority. In consequence, the National Film
Board was set up under the National Film
Act, to be the co-ordinator, adviser and general supervisor of government film activities.
A Film Commissioner was appointed as the
chief executive officer of the board, and it
was provided that the board should have
power to administer funds voted to it by
parliament for the production of films. Actual

production, however, remained the concern
of the Motion Picture Bureau. In 1941, as a
move toward greater efficiency, the a.tivities
of the bureau were transferred to the control of the National Film Board, and the Film
Commissioner became the director of the
bureau in addition to his other duties.
Since that time the production of films has
increased to an extent that was not contemplated by the enactment of 1939. Difficulties have been experienced in almost
every phase of operation, one of the principal
ones being caused by the temporary method
of employing staff. Although there was a
continuing program of work, personnel could
only be employed for a three-month renewable period. Also, there have been other
difficulties, for instance, in financing and
accounting, and in the making of contracts
for the distribution of films.
The government, recognizing the difficulties under which the board was operating,
decided to hire Messrs. J. D. Woods &
Gordon, a firm of management consultants,
to give their opinion about the business management of the board. This firm submitted
its report in March of this year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the honourable senator if that report has been tabled
in the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My practice has been
to table all documents which come to me for
tabling, but I am not in a position to say
whether this particular report was actually
tabled. If it has not already been tabled
here, I should think it would be readily
available.
The recommendations contained in the
report fall into two main categories: those
relating to internal organization and management, and those requiring legislative action.
The majority of the recommendations in the
first category have already been put into
effect.
Those that require legislation are
dealt with by this bill.
The main purposes of this legislation are
to accomplish the following:
(1) Define clearly the functions of the board
in conformity with its actual operations.
(2) Reconstitute the board on a basis
intended to make it possible to carry out
these functions efficiently.
(3) Confer on the board powers appropriate
to these functions, and clearly establish the
board's responsibility to parliament through
a designated minister of the Crown.
(4) Establish executive machinery designed
to make efficient administration possible.
(5) Confer power to bring continuing members of the staff under the Civil Service
Superannuation Act.

JUNE 27, 1950
(6) Establish financial arrangements suited
to the board's present operations.
The basic principles of the bill are that
the board shall be responsible, through a
minister, to parliament; that the powers
necessary to carry out the functions of the
board shall be vested in this board; and that
the commissioner shall be responsible to the
board and shall be its chief executive officer
charged with the administration of its operations.
In accordance with the recommendations of
the business consultants, the bill provides
that ministers of the Crown cannot be members of the board, as they can be at present;
that the membership of the board be increased
from eight to nine; that the Film Commissioner shall act as chairman, and that the
number of members from outside the public
service shall be increased from three to five.
The new financial arrangements that I
mention are designed to enable the board
to operate as efficiently as possible. Provision is made for an operating account for the
board, in the Consolidated Revenue Fund,
and for working capital to a limit of $700,000.
These are the main provisions of the bill.
I must apologize for the late introduction
of this measure in our house. The reason is
twofold: the new commissioner needed some
time to familiarize himself with the position,
and the Gordon report was not available until
the end of March; then it was necessary to
decide whether the bill should be introduced
at this session or delayed until next session.
After due consideration it was decided that
the sounder and more efficient operation of
the board that could be obtained by this bill
required its immediate presentation to parliament.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
believe this is the last piece of legislation to
come down this session. In the other house,
where the bill originated, second reading was
given without debate. I have no objection
to our giving the bill second reading this
evening, provided that there is a reference
to an appropriate committee, where we may
make further study of the measure tomorrow.
I have a number of questions to ask, which I
suppose the leader of the government will
not be able to answer now, but I shall state
them for the record in the hope that answers
may be available in committee. The questions, eight in number, are as follows:
1. What was the net revenue for the last fiscal
year from the sale and lease of films by the board?

2. What accounts are outstanding and uncollected?

What do they total. and what steps are being taken
to collect?
3. Who decides whether or not a film is In the
national interest?
4. What assistance is given by the board in forest
conservation work. in the making of films for the

Canadian Forestry Association or other associations,
and particularly in connection with conservation on
the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.
That is a very important question for all of

us who live in western Canada, because the
depletion of forests on the eastern slopes of
the Rocky mountains has considerable effect
on the amount of rainfall on the prairies during the crop season. I should like to know
what the Film Board is doing to help in that
regard.
Continuing with my questions:
5. What co-operation is there from the National
Film Board in connection with the development
of our Canadian tourist industry? How many films
have been made to encourage United States tourista
to visit Canada, and how are these films distributed
and shown?
6. Does section 10 of subsection 2 cover the
situation fully, so as to give full right of action
against the Board without a fiat?
7. What power has the minister over salaries of
less than $5,000?
8. How is the working fund of $700,000 arrived at?
Is this amount all that the Board can spend, or can
it spend $700,000 in addition to the other amounts
received by it.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: The request of my
honourable friend from Rosetown is a very
reasonable one, and when the bill has been
read a second time I shall be pleased to refer
it to a standing committee for further
inquiry.
The answers to my friend's specific questions might be facilitated if I had a copy of
them to place before the appropriate authorities at the earliest possible moment.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I will see that my friend
receives a list of the questions first thing
tomorrow morning.
Hon. Jacob Nicol: Honourable senators I
have followed with interest the reports made
by the chairmen of the various committees
which have studied the estimates this session,
and I am particularly interested in the
expenditures by the National Filin Board.
These committees on the estimates studied
the budgets of the various departments with
a view to determining where and how public
expenditures could be curtailed; but how can
we ever reduce the expenditures of Canada
if boards of this nature are allowed to carry
on in an extravagant manner? Yet the chairman of the National Film Board, when he

appeared before the Massey Commission, protested against a reduction of staff from about
800 to 700 odd. He wanted the Film Board
to be placed on the same basis as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. According
to him, the Film Board was humiliated
because, in order to be in a position to make
expenditures, it had to apply to the department and to the minister, by whom a certain
amount was allocated for its operations. He

SENATE

wanted the board to have a fixed sum voted
to it so that, like the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, it could go ahead and spend
money without consulting anybody else.
Honourable senators, I may be in error,
but I believe that the National Film Board
is one of the most useless bodies we have.
Why create an organization consisting of 800
employees to do things which can be done
far more cheaply and competently by existing
private companies? Were it necessary because
of the confidential nature of the work to
employ government personnel, I might be
willing to make an exception for this specialized type of service; but we know, from
reports which have been made, that numerous activities which could have been carried
on« by the Film Board were not assigned to
it because some of its employees were not
trustworthy, and had to be dismissed.
If thii be the situation, why continue this
board, and why vote it $700,000 a year? It
is all very well for us to express in an
academic way the opinion that the country
is spending too much money, that it should
begin to curtail its expenses; but I believe
that when we are asked to vote millions of
dollars to the bodies whose estimates come
before us, we should examine into the
objects and activities of those bodies and
decide whether it is necessary to perpetuate
them. I for one assert that this country does
not need a Film Board: we could well dispense with it, and by so doing, dispense with
eight hundred to a thousand employees, for
if, with the board's present budget, the number today is eight hundred, it will be a
thousand tomorrow. Any confidential work
or other duties of a special nature which the
government wishes to have done can be
assigned to private companies which are able
to do it at one-third of the cost. I do not
wish to carry on any further, but I must
register my opposition to what to my mind
are unnecessary expenses.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

OFFICIAL SECRETS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the

second reading of Bill 309, an Act to amend
the Official Secrets Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
containing four amendments is an attempt
by the government to comply with a request
made in 1946 by the Royal Commission on
Espionage. The commission did not recommend any specific changes in the Official
Secrets Act, but expressed the view that in
the light of the espionage report the Act
should be studied and, if necessary, amended
to provide additional safeguards. The Act
was studied by a security panel of the government, and these four amendments were
considered necessary.
Section 1 of the bill extends the meaning
of the phrase "office under His Majesty", as
used in the Act, to include employment in or
under a board, commission or other body
which is an agent of His Majesty in the right
of Canada or any province. This change is
designed to bring anyone who has access to
confidential government material within the

requirements of the Act.
The security panel considered that the Act.
which applies only to offences committed in
Canada, should, be amended to give it some
extra-territorial application. Section 2 of the
bill would make it an offence for a Canadian
citizen, or anyone owing allegiance to His
Majesty, to do anything outside the country
which if done in Canada would be an offence
under the Act.
Section 3 of the bill would amend section
14(l) of the Act, which provides the general
penalties for offences under the Act not
specifically provided for elsewhere in the Act.
The section now provides for a fine not
exceeding $2,000, or imprisonment of not
more than seven years, or both. The bill
proposes to leave the fine as it is, but to
increase the maximum prison term to fourteen years.
Subsection 2 of section 14 of the Act is
amended to assure that persons who are
arrested or convicted under the Act can be
fingerprinted and properly identified. This
amendment would remove the doubt which
has existed as to whether the Identification of
Criminals Act applies to all persons who have
been arrested and convicted under this Act.

JUNE 27, 1950
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a few observations on the
motion for second reading of this bill.
For at least the past four years many people
have been expecting the government to present a bill of this character. Now that we
have it, I am rather disappointed with it. I
had hoped that with the long delay the government would bring down a much more comprehensive bill than the one now before us.
However, as far as it goes, I do not think
anyone on this side of the house will find fault
with it.
Some history of official secrets legislation
may be of interest to honourable senators.
The first Official Secrets Act of which there is
any record was passed in 1889 by the parliament at Westminster. That Act was amended
in 1911, in 1920, and again in 1939, before the
outbreak of World War II. It is still in force
in Great Britain. In Canada we had the
British law of 1911, and also sections 85 and
86 of the Criminal Code. These measures did
not go nearly as far as the Official Secrets Act
which Canada passed in 1939, and which
repealed those sections of the Code and also
the British law of 1911 in so far as it applied
to Canada.
In looking back I was interested in the
penalties provided by sections 85 and 86 of
the Code. Section 85 provided for one year's
imprisonment, or a fine not exceeding $100, or
both fine and imprisonment, for certain
offences which then were regarded more or
less as misdemeanours, but which now are
considered to be quite serious.
A brief summary of the offences under
subsection 1 of section 85 is as follows: (a)
Unlawfully entering a fortress, arsenal, factory, dockyard, etc. of His Majesty; (b)
Obtaining after entering any such place documents, sketches, plans, etc.; (c) Attempting
to make a sketch or plan of the fortress,
arsenal, factory, etc.; (d) Communicating the
document, sketch .or plan to any person not
entitled to same, or communicating it in
breach of confidence; (e) Having possession of
such a document, sketch, plan, etc. and communicating the same to an improper person.
Under Subsection 2 of section 85 the penalty
provided was life imprisonment if it was the
intention of the accused to communicate any
information, document, sketch, plan, etc. to
a foreign state. Section 86 of the Code dealt
with similar offences committed by persons
holding or having held office under His
Majesty. In the case of communication to a
foreign state of any information, document,
etc., such person was liable to life .imprisonment, but in all other cases merely to imprisonment for' one year or a fine of $100, or
both.

Therefore, honourable senators, since 1939
we have had our own Official Secrets Act,
which greatly widened the scope of this
type of legislation and increased some of the
penalties.
I wonder why the Act of 1939 was passed.
It seems to me that parliament might more
easily have amended the Criminal Code to
cover all the matters that were dealt with
in the Act. Apparently it was considered
more feasible to adopted what is practically
a transcript of the British law.
Nobody paid much attention to matters of
this kind until 1946, when the startling discovery that a master spy ring was operating
in Canada resulted in the appointment of a
Royal Commission to investigate and make a
full report. I believe parliament was in
session when the commission filed its report.
The present bill, the leader of the government
has told us, is to implement the recommendations contained in that report. I do not understand why such action was not taken in 1946,
or 1947, or 1948, or during one of the two
sessions of parliament in 1949. I suppose the
government was engaged meanwhile in looking into the matter, and that it found some
difficulty in preparing the appropriate
amendments.
I am very much astonished at the nature of
the present amending legislation. It seems
to me that the government could have given
the whole matter very much more consideration.
For the information of honourable senators
I may state that the report of the Royal Commission contained seven recommendations,
and I propose to read those numbered 2, 3,
5 and 6, which appear on page 689 of that
report, and to refer in particular to No. 5.
They are as follows:
2. That the proper authorities in each service.
department and organization take such steps as may
be considered desirable and effective, In the light
of this report and of the evidence and exhibits, to
prevent further uhauthorized transmission of information and to set up further safeguards.
3. That al security measures should be coordinated and rendered as uniform as possible.
5. That the Official Secrets Act, 1939, be studied
in the light of the information contained in this
report and in the evidence and exhibits and, if it Is
thought advisable, that it be amended to provide
additional safeguards.
6. That consideration be given to any additional
security measures which would be practical to prevent the infiltration into positions of trust under
the govermnent of persons likely to commit acts

such as those described in this report.
As I have said, quite naturally we are all
in favour of the bill as far as it goes, but in
my opinion it is not only very late in coming
down, but does not go nearly far enough.
According to the explanati>n given by the
honourable leader, the new legislation has

SENATE
three more or less important features. The
first of these was explained by him. "Office
under His Majesty" now embraces employment in, on or under a commission. board, or
other body that is an agent of His Majesty in
right of Canada or any province. That, of
course, is very important because, to use the
language of the streets, we have boards and
commissions galore, and they have many
people working for them. It is very important that these employees should be brought
within the scope of the act.
The second feature of the new legislation
had to do with extra-territorial offences. Such
offences can now be tried in Canada if committed by a Canadian citizen or by a person
who, though not a Canadian citizen, owed
allegiance to Canada when he committed the
offence. Admittedly these extra-territorial
provisions are very difficult of enforcement.
To prosecute successfully it is necessary, of
course, to apprehend the offender, and the
offence is not extraditable. If the suspected
person goes to the United States, of course
he may be deported, but otherwise he can
be prosecuted only if he returns to Canada
voluntarily.
The third feature is that the maximum
penalty is increased to fourteen years, the
same penalty that was provided for in the
English Act of 1911.
All members of this chamber are in favour
of every security measure that can be devised.
With the world in its present condition,
security is a subject which vitally concerns
us. The situation in East Asia is very serious
indeed. I was hoping that the honourable
leader of the government would make some
statement to us with regard to it: probably
he will do so tomorrow or the following day.
Grave events of this kind make it of the
utmost importance that every practicable
measure of security should be taken into
consideration by the government, and be
embodied in legislation by further amendments of the existing act. I therefore urge
the government to give the subject their
unremitting attention with a view to establishing further safeguards, if any be possible.
To sum up, I am in favour of the bill as
far as it goes, but I must record my dissatisfaction with it as a whole, because it
carries out only in part the recommendations
of the Royal Commission. The commission
recommended other safeguards, but the bill
really provides no safeguards at all, and therefore accomplishes very little. About the only
thing the bill does in relation to the prosecution of offenders is to increase the penalties.
I therefore press on the government the
advisability of giving further study to this

important question with a view to bringing
down a much more comprehensive bill next
session.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I trust that when the bill is considered in
committee some attention will be given to
the term of imprisonment to be imposed on
those who entrusted with office or employed
in the service of the government, engage in
activities on behalf of a power which seeks
to control the entire world. In the light
of present day conditions, a penalty of
fourteen years' imprisonment is far too light
for the crimes it seeks to punish. I found
fault with the British law under which
Dr. Fuchs was sentenced to only ten years'
imprisonment for giving away to a foreign
power some of the most important secrets
that it is possible for a scientist to reveal.
I think that sentence was not nearly severe
enough, especially when one realizes that a
certain nation is busy arming itself to the
teeth and has in every country including
Canada, emissaries who are ready to sell out
the countries in which they are living. A
man who commits murder is sentenced to
life imprisonment, but in my opinion the
crime of a man who sells out his country
is far worse.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It was life imprisonment under the Code.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We only give him fifteen
years. I think the British law encourages
this kind of thing when it imposes a sentence
of ten-years for a crime such as Fuchs
committed. It is little wonder that the United
States was bitter about it.
I trust that when this bill is in committee
someone will recommend that the penalty for
these crimes be made life imprisonment.
In some places a man would lose his life
if he sold out his country.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

honourable senators, your committee recognizes that active and sincere support of the
United Nations is a fundamental basis of our
foreign policy. The United Nations, under the
present tragic circumstances, is the only
existing international organization designed
for the prevention of war. This report was
adopted by your committee on June 22 last.
At the present moment we realize even more
keenly the importance of an effective organization for the maintenance or the re-establishment of peace.
Finally, your committee considers that the
diplomatic service is a great credit to Canada,
and that the part played by its representatives
at Lake Success and other international conferences, has been sincerely directed to the
peace of the world.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
it was my privilege last week to pay a threeday visit to the great capital city of the
United States, Washington, and to meet many
prominent American citizens. My associations with those persons proved to me that
the people of that country had a high regard
for the Canadian nation as a whole, and I
wish at this time to warn those persons who
continually snipe at the United States and
express fears of that country taking over
Canada. I say without fear of contradiction
that we can thank God that we have as our
neighbour so great a nation as the United
States.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Not one of us would be here
tonight but for that great country.
In passing I may say that on my first visit
as a senator to the American capital I was
much better received than when I visited as
a member of the House of Commons. I could
see faces light up when I was introduced as
"Senator Reid", but they lit up more when I
said that members of the Senate of Canada
were appointed for life. A few senators who
were in the company said "We would like
to have that system over here".
Hon. Mr. Nicol: But that is going to be
changed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: My purpose in rising at this
time is to say a few words about the Canadian
legation in Washington, and to pay tribute
to our ambassadors abroad. No matter in
what country they are stationed, they are
held in the highest esteem. I met, amongst
others, Mr. Hume Wrong, and found him and
the officials serving under him to be most
delightful people.
When I went into the Canadian legation I
was struck by the thought that an outsider
who knew nothing of Canada would really
think, upon entering that building, that it

was the British legation. I have nothing to
say against Great Britain; but we must
remember that we are a nation in our own
right. I observed particularly that in the
entrance room there were three sets of pictures of the King and Queen, but no likenesses
of the Governor General or the present Prime
Minister of Canada. While I do not find
fault generally with the officials of the
External Affairs Department, there are a few
of the "old school tie type" who like to adopt
the manner and accent of the British people.
For my part, I should like to see things
that are characteristic of Canada placed in
our legations, so that the people of all countries may know that buildings belong to and
are controlled by the Canadian people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I dropped into a store near
the legation in Washington, and there I
inadvertently offered a Canadian one cent
piece along with some other change. The
store clerk looked at the coin and said "Sorry,
sir, but we don't take English money here".
My thoughts went back to the entrance of
the legation, where almost everything was
British and practically nothing Canadian.
True, In one of the inner waiting rooms of
the building there were pictures of some of
the prime ministers of the past; but these
did not seem to me to be a good enough
exhibit for this great-country of ours. I have
nothing but praise for the officials who represent Canada in her external affairs, but I
should think that our legations should contain
some articles representative of Canada and
the Canadian people.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, as this is the last of the reports to be
presented by the committees to whom the
estimates were referred, I would like to say a
word of appreciation for the work they have
done.
The policy adopted this session of referring
the estimates in detail to committees for
examination was in the nature of an experiment, and though I have not the slightest
doubt that from the experience gained this
year the procedure in the future can be improved, the chairmen and members of the
various committees are to be complimented
for their painstaking efforts.
I am not indifferent to the fact that I, as
government representative in this house,
may have been criticized for taking the initiative in inviting the examination, and possibly
the criticism of the estimates presented to
parliament by the government of which I was
a member. I am satisfied, however, that my
action in this respect was quite correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In my official capacity
I must from time to time ask this house to
agree to the expenditure of large sums of
money, and it seemed to me that it was my
duty to afford the Senate every opportunity I
could to examine the estimates before asking
it to vote supply.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: When the honourable
senator from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) was
criticizing the expenditures of the National
Film Board, and referring generally to the
reports of the various committees, it occurred
to me that I should point out that I have
not attended one committee meeting and have
taken no part in the preparation of the reports;
neither have I participated in the discussion
of the reports in this chamber. It may be
that in declining to do so I have laid myself
open to further criticism; however, the position in which I find myself is inevitable,
because of my dual role of government representative and nominal house leader. On the
one side, I must consider my responsibilities
as a member of the government; on the other,
my responsibilities to the members of the
Senate, who at all times have been most
generous in their confidence and support.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to.

Honourable Senator Crerar, that the Senate of
Canada approves of the calling by the United States
of America of a convention of delegates from the
democracies which sponsored the North Atlantic
treaty and representing the principal political
parties of such democracies, for the purpose of
exploring how far their peoples and the peoples of
such other democracies as the convention may

invite to send delegates, can apply among them
within the framework of the United Nations, the
principles of federal union.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I wish to apologize to

the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) because I am not prepared to go
on with the debate tonight. My position on
this order is not taken without cause, but is
affected by much the same considerations as
those I mentioned in connection with the
estimates: what I might say as an ordinary
member of the Senate is subject to some
qualification when, in dealing with international affairs, I speak with the responsibility of a member of the government. I hope
to speak tomorrow.
The order stands.

Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion of

the Senate, whenever an amendment to the constitution of Canada is made, or is to be made, requiring
the consent of one or more of the provinces, the
said consent can only be expressed by act or by
resolution of the legislature or legislatures of the
provinces concerned.

Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators, I

understand that the honourable senator from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) is not going to
speak.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: He so indicated to the
Whip.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: I would ask if anyone
else is interested, because, I understand, when
I speak I close the debate. If no one wishes
to speak this evening, I will close the debate
tomorrow.
The Order stands.

JUNE 27, 1950
Many of those testifying presented the committee with written briefs, and, in addition to
these, many briefs and statements have been
received from persons and organizations:
The witnesses who testified or presented
briefs gave freely of their time, thought, and
effort in a public spirited endeavour to assist
your committee by the imparting of their
knowled-ge and convictions on the important
subject under consideration. Your committee
expresses its gratitude for the generous
assistance which it has received.
Your committee was urged to recommend
the incorporation into Canadian law of the
United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Your committee finds however that the Universal Declaration, as its name implies, was
drafted. for general application and was not
designed with special reference to Canadian
conditions with our divided jurisdiction and
individual history. This finding also applies
to the draft articles appearing in the
Senate Resolution, most of which are copied
from the Universal Declaration. Witnesses
before your committee addressed themselves
to the general principles of Human Rights and
Freedoms and scarcely at all to the items in
detail.
Your committee prefers to express its own
thoughts as applied to Canadian problems
rather than to attempt to base its report on
on these individual paragraphs.
As a result of its inquiries your committee
is assured that there are a very large number
of persons in Canada who are deeply interested in the subject of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms and that much
thought has been devoted by our citizens to
the subject. That every man, woman and
child has rights is generally accepted as
axiomatic, -and that such rights should be
protected is a conviction as universally held.
Your committee also agrees with this view,
holding that every human being, irrespective
of mere classifications on account of race,
creed, sex, caste or colour, and other like
distinctions, bas rights which flow from his
divine creation. The Brotherhood of man
results from the fatherhood of God, and a
fundamental equality among men necessarily
follows. Such rights are not created by men,
be they ever so numerous for the benefit of
other men, nor are they the gift of governments. They are above the power of men to
create. They may be violated by men, but
not with impunity. They should be recognized, and every care should be taken to
preserve them inviolate. Individuals, communities and governmùents do wrong when
they attempt to take such rights away or to
disregard them. The invasion of the rights

of an individual is wrong irrespective of how
many share in the guilt, and, though the wrong
be at the instance of government.
It is not possible for your committee to give
an all-inclusive definition of human rights,
except in the broadest of general terms, or to
list the various ways in which human rights
may be violated. The right to life and liberty
is basic, and from this as a foundation there
follow the endless ways in which life may
be lived and liberty exercised, and the equally
endless ways in which the life and liberty of
one individual may be interfered with by
another individual or other individuals. Men
now inhabit the globe in great numbers, so
that the rights of each individual must necessarily be limited by the equal rights of all
other individuals. It is in order to preserve
this balance of rights that governments bave
been instituted and laws are devised and
enforced. The problems with respect to
human rights and fundamental freedoms arise
out of the fact that human beings must live
together in communities. In order that life
may continue and liberty be enjoyed, certain
rules of conduct become necessary. Long
and painful and frequently tragic experience
has taught us some of the things we must
avoid both individually and collectively if the
lives of individuals are to be lived in freedom.
The increase in population, industrial
development and intellectual progress, together with the tragic experience of two
great wars, have created new needs and
made apparent the necessity for the reaffirmation of old truths. The false ideology of
the Nazis, Fascists, and Communists based
on autocracy and disregard of the rights
of the individual; has strengthened our conviction that the way of life of the western
world is based upon respect for the rights of
the individual and also strengthened the conviction that governments are properly servants, not masters of the people. Men's
thoughts throughout the western world have
turned to the subject of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
The United Nations
Five years ago, representatives of fortynine nations gathered at San Francisco to
found the organization now known as the
United Nations. The long and costly war
waged by the Allied Nations agâinst a power
which professed and practised the grossest
violations of individual rights, had quickened
the instincts of freedom and the desire for
universal security. The awakened respect
for human rights was evidenced in the
Atlantic Charter and the "Four Freedoms"
message. As a result, references to basic
rights and fundamental freedoms appear in
seven of the articles of the Charter of the

588

SEN ATE

United Nations adopted at San Francisco
in 1945. The preamble of the charter reaffirms faith in human rights and in the
dignity and worth of the human person.
The state signatories of the charter pledge
themselves to promote universal respect for,
and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction
as to race, sex, language or religion. Canada
was a signatory of the charter.
Three additional years of discussion and
consultation produced the document which
was adopted by the General Assembly of
the United Nations meeting at Paris in
1948, known as the United Nations Universal
Of fiftyDeclaration of Human Rights.
eight nations represented at this United
Nations General Assembly, forty-eight voted
for the declaration, eight abstained and two
were absent. No vote was cast against it.
Canada voted for it.
The declaration states in its preamble that
"recognition of the inherent dignity and the
equal and inalienable rights of all members
of the human family is the foundation of
freedom, justice, and peace in the world,"
and declares that "disregard and contempt
for human rights have resulted in barbarous
acts which have outraged the conscience of
mankind."
The declaration enunciates the right of
all to life, liberty and security of person,
the right to equal treatment before the law;
to fair trial: to freedom from arbitrary interference with one's privacy; family; home and
correspondence; to freedom of movement;
to a nationality; to marry and found a
family; to own property; to freedom of
thought, conscience and religion; to freedom
of opinion and expression; to peaceful
assembly and association; to take part in
the government of one's country directly or
through chosen representatives; to periodic
and genuine elections by universal and equal
suffrage.
United Nations Covenant
The preamble of the universal declaration
speaks of measures to be taken, both internationally and nationally, to secure recognition and observance of human rights, and
accordingly the Human Rights Commission
of the United Nations is now drafting and
developing a. proposed covenant to take the
form of an international treaty imposing on
those nations which enter into it precise legal
obligations. While the terms of the proposed covenant are not yet finally settled,
your committee regards with sympathetic
approval this effort to bring about in the
world at large a fuller recognition of human
rights and a more universal practice of
fundamental freedoms.

The action of the Senate of Canada in
constituting this special committee, with
authority to enquire into and report on the
subject of human rights and fundamental
freedoms, is in keeping, in the national field,
with the preamble of the universal declaration. Your committee finds the Canadian
nation deeply interested in rights and freedoms both internationally and nationally.
Entry into Nationhood.
Canada is just commencing her life as a
nation. The British North America Act gave
to the colonies which it federated a limited
autonomy. The Imperial Parliament remained
in control and our external relations were
retained completely in the hands of the United
Kingdom authorities at Westminister. Gradually, however, over the years, the statesmen
of Canada have cast off, step by step, Canada's
colonial limitations, so that Canada has in
the fullness of time achieved a complete and
unfettered national status, together with a
high place in international affairs.
Just
recently we have given final appellate jurisdiction to our own courts, and the dominion
parliament has assumed control of the
Canadian Constitution in matters within the
jurisdiction of the dominion parliament. At
the present time representatives of the dominion and provincial parliaments are endeavouring to work out an agreed procedure for
control of the constitution in all respects. This
is the final step in the legalistic recognition
of Canada as a nation of equal status with
all other nations within the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Land of the Free.
This is then the very time for Canada to
decide the basis upon which this new nation
is founded. With an astounding unanimity
Canadians have individually decided that
Canada shall be a land of the free. That here
men shall live in the rule of law, in security
of person, and that none shall oppress.
Equality of right is basic in Canadian thought
and must be assured in Canadian law, so that
men may live confidently, in self respect,
associating freely and expressing their
thoughts without fear. This is the free, selfrespecting, manly nation which Canadians
have envisaged, and this is the time to nail
the emblems of law, liberty and human rights
to our mast-head. This is the very moment
in which to decide the basis of our nationhood,
to guarantee human rights and fundamental
freedoms to all our citizens, and to proclaim
our principles to the world.
Let it be said in the future that when
Canada assumed complete control of her
destiny, her first act was to affirm as the basic
principle of her federation, the Human Rights
and Freedoms of all her citizens.

JUNE 2 7, 1950
Let the Canadian Ship of State embark on
her glorious voyage into the future with the
Rule of Law at the helm, Liberty at the masthead, and Beauty, Culture and Happiness on
the prow.
Now the practical method for making these
ideals effective is to write the provisions protecting human rights into the Canadian Constitution, so that they may be administered
in our courts, and so that they may become
binding and obligatory alike upon individuals
and upon governments.
How to Proceed.
The preferable place for such fundamental
law is in the constitution, which at present in
Canada is the British North America Act.
This Act already contains a number of clauses
protecting certain valued human rights such
as the use of the two official languages, annual
sessions of parliament, elections every five
years, an independent judiciary, separate
schools, and generally a constitution "similar
in principle to that of Great Britain", or, in
other words, the practices of parliamentary
government.
These guarantees of certain
minority rights have profoundly influenced
our national development and indicate the
procedure we should now follow when guaranteeing individual rights, as distinguished from
minority rights. The advantage of incorporating provisions of fundamental law in the constitution are obvious. Such provisions would
be binding upon persons in ail parts of the
country and upon all governments, thus no
problems of dominion-provincial jurisdiction
on human rights and fundamental freedoms
would arise. Alterations in this fundamental
law would require national and provincial
concurrence, so that setting these safeguards
aside in isolated instances would present considerable difficulty.
The preservation of
liberty has a national as well as a local significance, and were the safeguards national in
scope, the guardianship of an independent
judiciary would be most effective.
The enactment of a national bill of rights,
however, present difficulties.
In Canada,
because of her history and the harmonious
association of peoples of different races,
language and religion, respect for provincial
rights as they have been deflned in the past
is essential. No informed person with any
sense of responsibility would suggest that the
dominion parlianent forcibly invade the provincial jurisdiction. Concurrence, therefore,
is an essential requisite to constitutional
progress.
A Passing Dificulty
This difficulty may not be insuperable, but
there is also another presently existing but,
it is hoped, passing obstacle. The British
North America Act is a statute of the Imperial
55950--39

589

parliament at Westminster, and objection is
now taken by Canadians to legislative intervention by an authority beyond our shores
and not of our own election, even though
such action is taken at our own instance.
Such a request by Canada to the United
Kingdom parliament would have the appearance at least of a surrender of sovereignty.
For these reasons, your committee is of
opinion that it would be wise to await the
time, which we hope is not far distant, when
prospective dominion-provincial conferences
will have worked out a method for the control
within Canada of the Canadian Constitution,
and agreement has been reached as to incorporation in the Constitution of a national bill
of rights.
Such agreement may not be as difficult or
unlikely as it might at first appear, for such a
bill of rights in the national constitution
would contain only the simple first principles
of human rights and freedoms, matters upon
which there is already very general
agreement.
It is realized that this procedure will take
time, however great the good will and concurrence of those in authority, and however
desirable the objective.
Declaration of Human Rights
Your committee therefore recommends that,
as an interim measure, the Canadian parliament adopt a declaration of human rights
to be strictly limited to its own legislative
jurisdiction. Such a declaration would not
invade the provincial legislative authority,
but it would nevertheless cover a very wide
field. While such a declaration would not
bind the Canadian parliament or future Canadian parliaments, it would serve to guide the
Canadian parliament and the federal civil
service. It would have application within all
the important matters reserved to the Canadian parliament in section 91 and in other
sections of the British North America Act.
It would apply without limitation within the
Northwest Territories.
A Canadian declaration of human rights
could, follow in its general lines the preamble
and. certain of the articles of the United
Nations Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, subject to the reservations expressed
by the Canadian delegates at the United
Nations. It would declare the right of everyone in Canada to life, liberty and personal
security, the right of equal treatment before
the law, to fair trial, to freedom from arbitrary
interference with one's privacy; family, home
and correspondence, to freedom of movement,
to a nationality; to obtain asylum from persecution; to found a family, to own and enjoy
property; to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion; to freedom of opinion and

SENATE
expression; to peaceful assembly and association; to take part in the government of the
country directly or though representatives
chosen at periodic elections by universal and
equal suffrage. The declaration would also
state that every one in Canada has duties to
our community and is subject to such limitations as are determined by law, for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect
for the rights and freedoms of others and of
meeting the just requirements of morality,
public order and of the general welfare and
good government of Canada. Finally, the
declaration would specify that none of its
provisions may be interpreted as tending to
permit any group or person to engage in
activity aimed at the destruction of the rights
and freedoms of the people of Canada.
Such a declaration of human rights adopted
by the Canadian parliament would solemnly
affirm the faith of all Canadians in the
basic principles of freedom, and it would
evidence a national concern for human rights
and security. Judges would recognize the
principles of such a declaration as part of
Canada's public policy, and subsequent parliaments would hesitate to enact legislation
violating its revered principles. To adults
its would convey a feeling of security, and
children would memorize its terms with pride.
Canada should lead the world in reliance
upon the rule of law, in her respect for
human rights and in her care for fundamental
freedom, and in a love of liberty. Her
adoption of a national bill of rights in due
time would set an example which would
enhance her status among the nations and
which might lead to similar progress by
others.
Draw the Bil.
A bill of rights, whether statutory or constitutional, should be carefully though
courageously drawn. Your committee recommends that the task be referred to a carefully
selected committee.
What is required in Canada is a broad
statement of human rights, leaving as did
the drafters of the United States Bill of
Rights, the detail of application and the
necessary qualifications and exceptions to the
courts.
Many of the provisions suitable for inclusion in a bill of rights already appear in

some portions of our law, but they are not
always of nation-wide application.
Some
fundamental rights are already expressed in
the constitution. Other provisions of freedom and security are in the statutes, and still
others in decisions of the courts, together
with custom, or the commonly accepted way
of doing things.
What is required in Canada is one grand
and comprehensive affirmation, or reaffirmation, of human rights, equality before the
law and of security, as the philosophical
foundation of our nationhood, that will assure
continually to each Canadian that he is born
free and equal in rights and dignity with
ail other Canadians, that he cannot be held
in personal slavery or arbitrarily arrested,
that he will always be presumed innocent
of any offence until proven guilty, that he
has freedom of thought, conscience, expression
and movement, and so on through the Universal Declaration. Thus will Canadians know
of their freedom, exercise it in manly confidence and be proud of their country.
Individual Responsibility.
The enactment of a bill of rights is
not, however, the last requisite to a free
and just society.
While individuals and
groups have natural rights, they have also
responsibilities. Individuals who practice discrimination, who in their daily life invade
the fundamental rights of others, should pause
to remember that this is Canada, a Christian
country in which the spirit of fairness, kindness, courtesy and understanding is the basis
of our well-being and happiness.
Conclusion.
Your committee concludes its report by
further recommending that all men give
thought to the Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of Man, so that by common consent the rule of law and liberty be more
fully established and more universally
practiced, to the end that the rights of the
individual be recognized and respected and
the well-being, dignity and security of all
humanity be thus preserved.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
A. W. ROEBUCK,
Chairman.

NATIONAL FILM BOARD BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE
Hon. W. D. Euler presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 317, an Act respecting the
National Film Board.
He said: Honourable Senators, the committee have, in obedience to the order of reference of June 27, 1950, examined the said bill,
and now beg leave to report the same without
any amendment.
THIRD READING
The flon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I move the third reading now.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, because of the title of this bill I wish to
take the opportunity to make a few brief
remarks, and with your permission I should
like to refer in a rather personal manner to
my appointment to this chamber. In doing
so, may I say that when I entered this
chamber I looked around and saw many
honourable members with whom I had the
opportunity and privilege of serving, in the
Nova Scotia legislature, from 1928 to 1935. I
have in mind the government leader (Hon.
55950-39

Mr. Robertson), the honourable gentleman
from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley),
the honourable gentleman from King's (Hon.
Mr. McDonald) and the honourable gentleman
from Clare (Hon. Mr. Comeau). I also saw
here some twenty-eight or thirty senators
who were former colleagues of mine in
another place.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I like to refer to it as the
House of Commons. Very pleasant relationships grew up there over a period of fifteen
years, from 1935 to 1950. Then, after having
been in public life for twenty-two years, on
the 2nd of May I was suddenly debarred from
entering the House of Commons. I was
informed that if I entered that chamber I
should be treated as a stranger, and there
were other indications that I was no longer
wanted there. Of course, you all realize that
a large number of people endeavour to find
their way into the House of Commons. I was
also notified that a vacancy existed in the
constituency which up to that time I had had
the honour to represent-Halifax city and
county-and which incidentally.has a wonderful harbour that I never forget to mention.
And while I was wondering what was going
to take place, next, I learned that the reason
for all these happenings was my appointment
to the Senate.
It was with a real sense of appreciation that
I learned afterwards of the tributes which my
former colleagues in the House of Commons
were good enough to pay me. The honourable
and well-known member for Fort William,
the Reverend Dan McIvor, was one. He is a
wonderful character, who by his manner of
living does much to make Canadian life
worth while.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: He was followed by the
honourable gentleman from Peel, Mr. Graydon, who was that day acting as house leader
for the opposition. He and I worked together
on committees over a long period of time,
and enjoyed very friendly relations; so I was
delighted by his remarks. Another good friend
who spoke was the honourable gentleman
from Winnipeg South, Mr. Mutch. Then a
tribute was paid to me from the far West,
the Pacific Coast, by the honourable member
for Fraser Valley, Mr. Cruickshank. Men
from the extreme east to the extreme west
of Canada were most kind to me.
When I entered this chamber I wasgreeted in such a warm manner that I at
once felt at home. I wish to refer particularly to the greetings I received from the
honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw), the honourable senator from

SENATE

St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden) and my
former colleague from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck).
The friendly atmosphere of this house
prompts me to take this opportunity to say
"thank you" to honourable senators. I trust
that the confidence reposed in me by my
appointment has not been misplaced, and I
hope that I will be able to live up to the
fine traditions of this honourable body.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable gentlemen,
while listening to the mild criticisms of the
National Film Board by the honourable
senator from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol), who
has had a wide experience in matters of
communication, I felt that I should express
my own views, which are rather contrary
to those he expressed. As a business man I
believe in publicity, and in my own part of
the country I have always used the columns
of the press, and the radie broadcasting
stations, to make my wares known. The
results of such advertising have been very
satisfactory.
I believe that there is a place in Canada
for the operations of the National Film
Board, and in support of that belief I should
like to offer a few statistics on the work it
has been doing. First let me say that I hope
the house will see fit to adopt the report of
committee and 'to give third reading to the
bill.
When we think of communicating with
people on a large scale, our minds naturally
turn to newspapers, magazines, books and
radio stati'ons-both those of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation and of privately
owned companies. We are familiar with the
part that motion pictures play in the lives of
our citizens, as well as with the daily use
of the telephone and telegraph for the purpose of spr.eading news and information
which moulds the character of our citizens.
Although much criticism has been directed
at the administration of the film board, I
feel that it is an agency of the government
which can do much for Canada, and this
afternoon I intend to discuss in a broad
sense its value, purposes and usefulness,
rather than criticize it.
It is interesting to note that according to
a radio survey published on November 19,
1948, ninety-four per cent of the householders in Canada-or some 3,127,000 persons
-own
radios. Most of these people were
city dwellers, but not a few were country
people. If my memory is correct the survey
showed that, city homes have an average of
from two to ten radios, while the average
in country homes is two. There can be no

question, therefore, that the medium of radio
broadcasting has a great effect upon the
lives of Canadian people.
It is of little importance whether motion
picture advertising is directed through a
government agency or a private company.
I recall a discussion I had recently with the
honourable senator from Kings (Hon. Mr.
McDonald), who remarked that in his former
capacity of Minister of Agriculture in the
province of Nova Seotia he could not make
proper use of films to demonstrate the full
extent of the work being carried on by his
department. Later, the National Film Board
was able to supply him and his department
with films which did much to create greater
interest in agriculture in Nova Scotia, my
native province. I also know from personal
experience of the good which has been
derived from fine films conceived, created
and distributed in connection with the
fisheries industry of not only Nova Scotia but
elsewhere in the East, in British Columbia,
and in fact, throughout Canada.
Only today I, in common with other honourable senators, received a letter from the
Department of Labour, from which I was
pleased to note that the department is making
use of the board to bring before the public,
especially employers, the situation of the
older employee, the person who at the age
of forty-five years or more is finding it rather
difficult to get work. In his letter, Hon
Humphrey Mitchell, Minister of Labour,
states:
The problem of the older worker and employment
is everybody's problem.
He goes on to refer to the fact that his
department, in co-operation with the National
Film Board, has prepared a film for general
distribution throughout Canada, for the purpose of encouraging employers to give consideration to men of forty-five years of age
and over who, as I said, find it difficult to
obtain employment. The film is entitled "Date
of Birth", and without intending to advertise
the Capitol theatre, I may say that the first
showing will be at that theatre next Friday
morning.
That, as I see it, is an indication of the service which the board is giving to the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries, Labour, and
External Affairs, as well as to various educational and other agencies of government.
I have in my hand a copy of the report of
the Department of External Affairs for the
year 1949. Reference to the uses of films
occupies most of page 71. In part it is as
follows:
Films on Canada have been shown during the
past year to increasingly large audiences abroad.
Thirty-five diplomatie and consular posts now have

JUNE 28, 1950
facilities to screen films, and to promote the noncommercial circulation of Canadian Government
films in tneir territeries.
In Australia, distribution now averages over 1,000
screenings a month to audiences totalling 85,000; in
New Zealand about 200 screenings have taken place
before audiences of some 15,000 persons, a large
percentage of whom are school children.
In the United States, the embassy and all consulates, save New York and Chicago, operate film
libraries; and in Western European countries distribution has notably increased.

After some information about screenings in
Europe, the report continues:
Distribution averages in Latin America have been
maintained, with increased activity reported from

Mexico and Brazil, where an average of at least
15,000 people see Canadian films each month . . .
To these results must be added the distribution
obtained through trade commissioner offices, chiefly

In countries where Canada has no diplomatic or
consular representation . ..

The sale of prints for

non-commercial purposes, theatrical bookings
arranged by the National Film Board, and the use

of our documentaries on television networks in the

United States, add to the amount of Canadian
information shown on foreign screens.
So, honourable senators, I feel that the
board in its present form is carrying out the
five objects outlined by the government leader
in his statement yesterday.
After having read the functions and objectives, asigned to them, I put down the duties
of the National Film Board as follows:
(a) To advise on government film activities.
(b) To co-ordinate national and departmental film programs.
(c) To direct the distribution of government films in Canada and abroad.
(d) To co-ordinate and develop information
services and supplement this distribution.
The primary duty of the National Film
Board is to present the Canadian scene, at
home and abroad, in documentary films, still
photographs and related graphic materials.
Through these media, Canadians learn more

Our newspapers also are in a position to

evening editions, published in Canada. The

reported to be aproximately 2,500,000, and
the circulation of the French-language dailies
is about 570,000. There are also four Chinese
and two Yiddish dailies published in Canada.

STAFF OF THE SENATE
SEVENTH REPORT OF INTERNAL
ECONOMY COMMITTEE

Hon. Norman McL. Paterson presented the
seventh report of the Standing Committee on
Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts.
(The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.)
Hon. Thomas Reid: May I ask the honourable chairman if the recommendations contained in this report would bring the members of the Senate staff who are enumerated
in the list into line with corresponding
employees of the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I am advised that they
are in line with those of the House of
Commons.
The report was concurred in.
EIGHTH REPORT

Hon. Mr. Paterson presented and moved
concurrence in the eighth report of the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts.
(The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.)
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
NINTH REPORT

Hon. Mr. Paterson presented and moved
concurrence in the ninth report of the Standing Committe on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts.
(The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.)
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I again ask whether it
is the intention of the Internal Economy
Committee to give consideration to placing
the members of the Senate staff on the same
level as the corresponding members of the
House of Commons staff?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: We give consideration
to the length of service, and we have endeavoured to make the standing of the staff
correspond with that of the House of Commons as fairly as possible. I suggest that

the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) attend one of our
meetings.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not a member of the
committee.. I hear that statement all the
time. I get lectured by the leader on this
sort of thing, and until I am a member of
the committee I do not intend to go to the
meetings just to listen.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
TENTH. REPORT

Hon. Mr. Paterson *presented and moved
concurrence in the tenth report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts.
(The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.)
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would like to ask whether
the salary for the position mentioned in this
report compares with that for the corresponding position in the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I have no other answer.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thanks.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
as a member of the Standing Committee on
Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts,
I should like to add to what has already been
said by the chairman. In answer to the questions raised by the Honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), I would
advise him that these reports are not based
on the principle of making the salaries of
Senate officials correspond to those of the
House of Commons officials. These advances
are based on entirely different grounds.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I appreciate that information.

HUMAN

RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL

FREEDOMS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Special Committee on
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved concurrence in the report.

He said: Honourable senators, I have few
comments to make on the report at this time.
It was carefully considered; every word of
it was weighed. It contains not only my
sentiments but those of the whole committee
of which I had the honour to be Chairman.
All I care to do now is to acknowledge the
industry, the public spirit and the loyalty of
the committee members who attended to
what I regard as an exceedingly important
piece of Senate work. We held no fewer than
eight public meetings, at which we examined
thirty-six witnesses. In addition, there were
three evening sessions devoted to perfecting
the draft of the report. So I think it is safe
to say that the work which the Senate
assigned to this committee has been carefully, industriously and seriously carried to
a conclusion.
I only wish to add my personal appreciation of the industry, public spirit and co-operation of the committee members. I am
grateful to those who patiently and persistently attended the meetings and carried the
work through to such success as the report
evidences. To some it may not appear a success, but in my opinion it was a great success. In my humble way I am proud of what
I regard as the exceedingly important work
done by the committee, and again I wish to
thank the members who helped me do my
job as chairman.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, as
I was one of the members of the Special
Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and as I previously served during two sessions as one of the chairmen of
the joint committee on the same subject, I
believe it is my duty to make a few comments
on the report now before us.
On November 16, 1949, I discussed in this
house the resolution which had been presented by the senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and which to a large
extent was similar to the motion that led to
the appointment of the committee which has
made the present report. The remarks and
recommendations that we are now considering are on many points perfectly in accord
with views I have previously expressed. I
must say quite candidly that this is for me
a source of real satisfaction. I am glad to
sec that our distinguished chairman (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and my colleagues on the committee hold the same opinion as I do on matters
to which I attach the greatest importance.
First of all, I am glad that the report
makes quite clear the difficulty inherent in
our federal system of divided jurisdiction
when we wish to adopt any enactment relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms. Your committee takes very definitely
the attitude that respect for provincial rights
is essential. We affirm emphatically in our

JUNE 28, 1950
report-I am reading from the latter part of
the fourth paragraph on page 589 of yesterday's Hansard:
No informed person with any sense of responsibility would suggest that the Dominion Parliament
forcibly invade the provincial jurisdiction.

Con-

currence, therefore, is an essential requisite to conatitutional progress.
Such a categorical statement will put an end
to the claims of those who wanted our committee to act as a board of censors to review
and to condemn the policies of certain provincial governments, even to summon the
premier of my province before us, and to
hold sittings at various places in that province
for the hearing of alleged grievances. Such
a course of action would be a gross violation of our constitution, and would be
absolutely contrary to the sovereign rights of
our various provinces in their respective
spheres. The present report puts it beyond
doubt that we intend to limit ourselves
strictly and scrupulously to the field which is
within our own legislative jurisdiction. It
was high time for us to state forcibly, as
we do in the report, our firn intention to
respect scrupulously the letter and spirit of
our constitution. On this point our report will
dissipate some legitimate fears which had
arisen in certain quarters, and it will be
hailed with satisfaction.
On this question of provincial and federal
jurisdiction with respect to human rights, I
wish to make a last remark, which may be of
some interest to those who are specially concerned with an apparent conflict between the
dominion and the provinces. In June 1949 it
was my privilege to address in Detroit a
convention of the Inter-American Bar. I suggested at that time that the charter of the
United Nations should be amended so as to
cover the case of federal states in the same
manner as the charter of the International
Labour Organization does. The charter of
that organization provides that the federal
authorities are bound by the conventions to
which they adhere, only when their provisions are held to be within federal competence. When this is not so, the conventions
dealing with provincial matters are simply
submitted to the proper authorities as recommendations which ithey are free to adopt or
reject as they see fit. I am credibly informed,
and I have every reason to believe, that an
amendment along these lines will be submitted for adoption in the near future at Lake
Success. In fact, in the draft Convention on
Human Rights now being considered by the
United Nations-a copy of which is in the
possession of the senator from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon)-blank spaces have been left
for the insertion of articles concerning federal
states. This makes it quite clear that at least

this vital matter of federal and provincial
jurisdiction is now receiving proper attention
in that quarter.
I am pleased that the committee has recommended, as a first step, that:
The Canadian Parliament adopt a declaration of

human rights to be strictly limited to its own legislative jurisdiction.

This is precisely the suggestion which I
modestly offered ta the house last year-and
I still believe it is the wisest course to follow
-when I said:
We should try to begin to agree on a few basic
principles clearly within our federal sphere of jurisdiction and clearly acceptable to the great majority
of the Canadian people. Once we have accomplished
this first task, our next step would be, I think, to
embody such principles in a short and concise
declaration of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Those words, honourable senators, are to
be found on page 281 of Hansard of last
session.

I fully agree with the topics listed in the
report and which we recommend should be
covered by the proposed declaration. I shall
refer briefly to only three points. First, I
have always believed that for every right
there is a corresponding duty. In this connection the report recommends that the draft
declaration should expressly state that:
-every one in Canada has duties to our community and is subject to such limitations as are
determined by law, for the purpose of securing due
recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms
of others and of meeting the just requirements of
morality, public order and of the general welfare
and good government of Canada.
This portion of the report reproduces and
applies to Canada the text of Article XXIX

of the Universal
Rights.

Human

I come now to Article XXX of the universal

declaration, which reads:
Nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as
implying for any state, group or person, right to

at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms
set forth herein.
Is it not so, honourable senators, that communism now constitutes the worst threat to

liberty we must not jeopardize our security
by blindly placing in the hands of subversive
elements the ability to destroy our constitutional temple of historic freedom. I believe
that proper steps must be taken to prevent
any possible abuse of our contemplated
declaration on human rights. It must not be

criminal saboteurs-the fifth column of a
foreign power-to overthrow our national
institutions and try to inaugurate the abhorrent dictatorship which now enslaves such a
large part of mankind. Let us realize once

SENATE
and for all, honourable senators, that totalitarianism is absolutely irreconcilable with our
liberal conception of human rights.
Take, for instance, the right to seek and to
enjoy asylum from persecution. This right, as
set out in Article XIII (1) of the universal
declaration, is a stipulation which we feel
should be incorporated in our drafit declaration. This right of asylum is denied by the
communists, among others, to the unfortunate
displaced persons who are resisting forcible
repatriation to countries now behind the Iron
Curtain. This policy of the Soviet is rightly
condemned by George Scelle in his publication Cours de Droit International Public, in
which he describes the policy as a retrograde
step, or as the French say, régression, (p. 543).
Referring to the right of asylum, at page 823
of the publication, the author says:
Today one scarcely hesitates to recognize its
legitimacy, or even its legality.
On the grounds of humanity there is now
general acceptance of the principle that a
state will not surrender political offenders.
A considerable body of usage supports this
doctrine, and according to Pitt Cobbett's
International Jurisprudence, volume 1, 6th
edition, pages 268-292, it is followed almost
universally. It was only fair, therefore, that
we insert in our draft declaration this
century-old right of asylum, which is a glorious tradition not only for Canada but also
for Great Britain, the United States, France,
Switzerland, Belgium, Latin Arnerica and
other countries. On this point I fully support
the report now before the house.
Honourable senators, it is to the last paragraph of the report that I attach the most
importance. It contains a very inspiring reference to the fatherhood of God and the
brotherhood of man. This conclusion justly
completes the reference appearing at the
beginning of the report where it is stated in
substance that our rights flow from our divine
Creator, and that all human beings are the
children of the same Father. It is with a
feeling of legitimate pride that I subscribe to
this worthy conclusion, by which we have
tried to render unto God what is due to God.
I wish to thank the chairman and the members of the committee for having inscribed
this great truth in this document, which has
been so carefully drafted, and, which will
remain a source of noble inspiration for those
who come after us. May all Canadians
remember that, "Unless the Lord keepeth the
city, he watches in vain who watches over it".
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: I find myself
in the same position that I am sure all honourable senators are in: I have heard the
report of the committee read by the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) but have not had the printed

report long enough to properly consider it.
Therefore, bearing in mind my responsibility
as a member of the government, I should like
to ask that the debate be adjourned until
tomorrow. That however, does not prevent
me from complimenting the chairman and the
members of the committee on the work and
study that have gone into the preparation of
the report.
I recall that when the question of specific
recommendations to the forthcoming Dominion-Provincial conference were discussed
during the previous session, I felt it incumbent upon me to point out the undesirability
of ýsuch procedure. Regardless of the difference of opinion in the matter, the study and
recommendations on the subject of human
rights has been of inestimable value to the
newcomers to Canada, who are perhaps not
as familiar with our traditions as we are.
On behalf of any honourable senators,
including myself, who may wish, after reading
it, to make some contribution to the discussion, I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
CONVENTION OF NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
22, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Euler:
That the Senate of Canada do approve the calling
by the United States of America of a Convention of
delegates from the democracies which sponsored
the North Atlantic treaty and representing the
principal political parties of such democracies, for
the purpose of exploring how far their peoples and
the peoples of such other democracies of the Convention may invite to send delegates, can apply

among them within the framework of the United
Nations, the principles of federal union.

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, the subject of international co-operation is very much in the public mind. At
the moment we are witnessing proofs of the
co-operation of sovereign countries whose
peoples have much in common and who recognize that common action is in the general
interest. As I interpret the meaning of the
resolution of the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), it is that, without
undervaluing the admirable progress which,
through the mutual efforts of the respective
governments, has been made in international
co-operation, it assumes the possibility of
some form of federal union which would provide a surer and firmer foundation on which
to build, and that it is therefore desirable that
all people of good will should try to determine
the scope and practicability of such a union.
I do not suppose that anyone who realizes the
significance of the times in which we live,

JUNE 28, 1950
and the necessity for co-operative action,
could feel that a discussion such as this is not
desirable; and I compliment the honourable
senator from Waterloo on having, through his
resolution, evoked it.
I was much impressed with the calibre
and content of the speeches which have been
made on the subject. If the resolution elicited
any opposition at all, certainly it was very
slight. Some of the statements which have
been made impressed themselves particularly
upon me and have frequently recurred to my
mind. I remember, for example, what the
honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) said as to the possibility of federalizing a larger group of countries-for
instance, those presently bound together by
the North Atlantic pact, and others varying
greatly in area and population. He said, if I
recall correctly, that he could envisage Canada and countries with populations even
smaller than Canada becoming part of a federal union and thus more easily maintaining
their identityHon. Mr. Gouin: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: -when perhaps such
a wider grouping would be impracticable if
the proposed scheme-to cite the instance he
mentioned-was for a federal union between
countries of the relative size of Canada and
the United States. I have been struck with
the essential truth of what he said. Consider
the situation of Prince Edward Island, the
smallest of the Canadian provinces from the
viewpoints of area and population. It contains, I suppose, not more than 90,000 inhabitants; and it is federated with proyinces as
large as Ontario and Quebec, each containing
three or four million people. But in the larger
confederation composed of ten provinces it
maintains its identity and, I believe, will
maintain it indefinitely. Were the federation
confined to one small and one larger province,
the identity of the smaller unit would be
much less secure than it is as a member of the
larger organization. In the larger confederation it is in the interest of all to guard jealously the identity and the standing of even
the smaller units. So what my honourable
friend has said in this respect, as in others,
possessed considerable merit. I believe he
has, with others, made a valuable contribution to the debate.
No one will deny, I think, that recent
years have witnessed a great advance in
international co-operation. The North Atlantic
Pact, by which we bind ourselves to come to
the assistance of any party that is attacked,
marks the tremendous advance which has
occurred in the last fifteen years, both in
Canadian and American points of view. So
far as I know, the principle has encountered
no organized opposition: it is recognized as
55950-40

desirable and necessary. As we proceed to
the implementation of that pact, more particularly at this time in the field of defence,
we find almost general acceptance of a change
from the integration of the defence forces
of the nation in what were called wellrounded individual forces to a merger whereby one country concentrates on one service
and another country on something else. This
change accomplishes, in a time of peace, or in
the qualified peace we have at the moment,
a degree of co-operation almost as great as
existed during the war, when the supreme
command of the armies in Western Europe
was entrusted to General Eisenhower. A
similar trend appears in the economic field.
So no great stretch of the imagination is
required when my honourable friend asks
us to look to the future and explore how far,
in our mutual interests, this tendency
ultimately will go.
I must admit, nevertheless, that whilelargely at Canada's instigation, through the
insertion of clause 2-a desire is manifested
to co-operate in the economic field, which is
of equal if not greater importance than the
defence field, less progress has been made.
But I believe the logic of events will drive us
in the same direction. Take as an example
the provision of armaments by the parties
to the North Atlantic Pact. We have the
skills, the natural resources and the equipment required to produce in practically
unlimited quantities the most modern and
up-to-date weapons of war. If there is a
limitation it is an economic one involving
the burden that can be borne by the peoples
of these respective countries without radically
reducing their standard of living. It goes
without saying that we can carry the burden
if we are prepared to make the sacrifice;
but military co-operation may be governed
to a great extent by our readiness to lower
our standard of living to a level which, to
say the least, would be highly undesirable.
It is difficult to assess the factors that are
compelling the present trend towards international co-operation. Probably the fear of
the spread of communism is the chief one.
It is problematical just how far we would
have progressed along the road if, in the past
five years, the Soviet Union had not been
so un-co-operative. It remains to be seen
what would happen to the present trend if
the Soviet Union should suddenly change its
policies and become co-operative.
The simple truth is that the welf are of the
peoples of the world is the primary factor,
irrespective of what attitude the Soviet Union
may or may not adopt. The immediate problem is to assure 'the maximum welfare among
the peoples of the countries bound together
by the North Atlantic Pact, because upon

SENATE

them for the moment devolves the major
responsibility of maintaining freedom and
happiness for all who think as we do.
To 'the extent that the fear of communism
is a factor in compelling co-operation, I suggest that we cannot deny the fact that we
must always bear in mind two simple ideas.
The first of these is that to the peoples of the
world, including those of the communistically
controlled countries, we must be able to say
truthfully something like this: "Our people
are free, are happy, are well fed and are well
housed. They want you to share in their
freedom and happiness". I am sure honourable senators will agree that the peace of the
world will ultimately depend on what the
peoples of the world think. But while moving in this direction it is desirable-lest the
totalitarian governments of the communistic
countries dreaming of world conquest should
contemplate provoking a conflict-that we do
not forget the second idea, namely, that we
must be capable of providing weapons of war
in such quantities and of such quality as will
enable us to say effectively to those governments: "You attack us at your own peril".
I am confident that our way of life is sure to
endure if we can truthfully say that these
two essentials result from our economy and
our combined strength.
I do not need to emphasize the need for
maximum military co-operation; tha-t is
pretty generally recognized,; but I do not
believe there is enough appreciation of the
necessity for co-operation in the economic
field in order to provide the highesit possible
standard of living for our people. This
standard would serve as an ideal for the rest
of the world, and, we should be able to provide
the weapons of war without reducing this
standard of living too seriously. The need
for co-operation in the economic field is perhaps more apparent among the people of
Western Europe than elsewhere. That area,
which is densely populated, possesses relatively small natural resources, and has been
divided into eight or ten almost water-tight
compartments as far as trade is concerned.
The urgent need for action to strengthen the
economy of this area has been recognized not
only by Western European statesmen but by
the United States, a country which has taken
the lead in 'this direction by reason of the
influence it exercises through the ECA.
I should like to quote what Mr. Paul
Hoffman, the Administrator of the ECA, is
reported 'to have said in a very recent edition
of the New York Times. It is as follows:
Economic isolation breeds political isolation and
military insecurity. Neither Western Europe nor
the United States can afford this consequence. The
economic unification of Western Europe, therefore,
must be a step toward the economie unification of
the entire non-communist world. Only by creating

expanding, dynamic and freely-trading communities
through the free world can there be that "restoration or maintenance of individual liberty, free institutions and genuine independence which the Congress bas set as the goal of our American foreign
policy."

The New York Times reports that Dr. Dirk
U. Stikker, Netherlands Foreign Minister and
newly-elected chairman of the council for
the organization of the Marshall Plan countries, spoke in Washington, D.C., on March 2
of this year, in these words:
Ten years ago it took the attack of a merciless
military force to drive us to pool our resources and
fight through to final victory. Today we are trying
to clear the way through a skein of customs tariffs,
licensing systems and diverse currency, and exchange devices, to the eventual real integration of
Europe.
The habits and political devices of a
thousand years in some cases have to be laid aside
to achieve this.

Some time ago Winston Churchill wrote as
follows:
No European can gaze upon the astonishing spectacle of these internal tariff walls without being
amazed at the embarrassments and difficulties in
spite of which the peoples of Europe get their daily
bread.

Honourale senators, here is the background
of the problems facing Western Europe.
Bearing this in mind it is easier to realize the
compelling reason for the drastic proposals
that have recently been made under the
leadership of the French government to integrate the steel and coal industries of Western
Europe. The danger is, of course, that in the
process the partners of the North Atlantic
Pact will find themselves divided into three
groups-an integrated Western Europe, the
United Kingdom, and 'the dollar area of the
United States and Canada.
Generally speaking, honourable senators,
I think that, however difficult it may be to
achieve maximum co-operation there must be
general agreement on its desirability. What
has been accomplished up to the present time
has been done through the co-operation of
sovereign countries, and we hope that more
will be accomplished.
However, history
shows that co-operation, desirable though it
may be, presents great difficulties and many
pitfalls.
The New York Times recently
credited the great Napolean with having once
said, "Give me allies to fight". His meaning
was-and I again quote-"Sovereign states
in military association traditionally suffer
from a host of hardships, divided commands,
ragged strategy, uncohesive forces and international jealousies".
What applies to military association may
well apply to economic co-operation. It must
be remembered, honourable senators, that in
democratic countries governments come and
go. Today the governments of most countries,
at least in the area of the partners to the

JUNE 28, 1950
North Atlantie Pact, are anxious and eager that, on the lowest basis of self-interest, we

a high-pressure method of inducing the

on the other hand, I would think that the
opponents of the resolution would not take
kindly to a suggestion which might be interpreted as an endeavour on our part to

stances I would suggest to my honourable
friend from Waterloo that he consider the
desirability of changing his resolution in such
a manner as to remove any possible criticism.
I have consulted the government as to the
attitude I should take towards this resolution
and, as is my custom in such cases, I choose
to follow its direction as far as possible, for
that is the basis of governmenit solidarity.
The government shares my view that the
resolution should be changed. In discussing
the matter, my honourable friend from
Waterloo made the suggestion that perhaps
I would like to move that the resolution be
amended. In answer to my friend I would
say that, as he is the sponsor of the resolution
and has pioneered it thus far, I have no desire
to interfere with it at this stage. I would
merely offer for his consideration one or 'two
alternatives which, in my opinion, would not
leave us open to the possible charge that we
had taken a direct step towards asking the
United States of America to call a convention
this year.
As the first alternative resolution, I would
suggest the following:
That, in the opinion of this house, Canada should
join with the other democratic nations which sponsored the Atlantic pact in sending delegates representing their principal political parties to a convention to be held as early as possible, to explore how
far these nations are willing to go in applying,
within the framework of the United Nations, the
principles of free federal union.
My second alternative resolution reads:
That, in the opinion of this house, if the United
States invites the democracies which sponsored the
North Atlantic treaty to name delegates representing
their principal political parties, to meet this year
with delegates of the United States in a federal
convention to explore how far their peoples and
the peoples of such other democracies as the convention may invite to send delegates can apply among
them, within the framework of the United Nations,
the principles of free federal union, Canada should
accept the invitation.
And by way of a third suggestion:
That, the Senate of Canada do approve ofor ur'ge
-the calling of a convention of delegates from the
democracies which sponsored the North Atlantic
treaty and representing the principal political
parties of such democracies, for the purpose of
exploring how far their peoples and the peoples of
such other democracies as the covention may invite
to send delegates, can apply among them, within
the framework of the United Nations, the principles
of federal union.

As much as I commend the action of the
honourable senator from Waterloo in the
sponsoring of this resolution, I am not in a
position to support its exact phraseology.
Therefore I have offered for his consideration
These
these three alternative resolutions.
proposals are the result of my consultation
with one of two other members of the house.
I believe that one honourable senator who
spoke in the debate suggested that the resolution should be to the effect that Canada call
such a convention. However, I would think
that in order to be successful it should be
called by one of the larger democracies.
So, honourable senators, it is with considerable regret, and no suggestion of criticism, that I find myself unable to move an
amendment to the resolution which my honourable friend has pioneered in this house.
The hour is getting late, and as there is
further business to occupy the house for the
balance of the afternoon, and as my honourable friend from Waterloo may wish to give
some consideration to my suggestions, if no
other honourable senator wishes to participate
in the debate at this time, with my friend's
approval I would be pleased to have the Whip
on this side of the house adjourn the debate
until we meet tomorrow afternoon. On the
other hand, my friend may wish to ascertain
the viewpoint of honourable senators.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
have no objection to the debate being
adjourned at this time; but in the few
moments I have had to consider the suggestions of the government leader, it might
be well that I proceed now with what I have
to' say. If I am able to sense the feeling of
the house, I may then choose to adjourn the
debate until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Whatever you prefer
is quite satisfactory to me.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The difficulty may adjust
itself when I have given rny thoughts on the
matter.
It is my understanding that the sponsor of
a motion bas the right, in closing the debate,
to rebut the arguments whicb have been
advanced against the motion; but that he
should not intrQduce any new matter.
There have been many eloquent and convincing speeches made by members on both
sides of the bouse, and with one exception
they have been in favour of the motion; and
though I do not wish to prolong the debate,
I am compelled to make certain observations
with regard to them.
It is true that the leader of the government
did suggest to me a change in the wording
of the resolution; but I am frank to say that

session, a telephone message came from Texas
from Mr. Will Clayton, former Under
Secretary of State of the United States.
Apparently Mr. Streit had called Mr. Clayton
from Washington, and he in turn had immediately telephoned me to say that my suggesion
was intensely interesting; that he had inquired of and talked with other people,
and was quite sure that the idea of
associating Canada with the United States
in the calling of this convention would find
great favour in his country. I hope honourable senators will not construe all this as
an attempt on the part of these gentlemen to
dictate to or influence us. Mr. Clayton also
said that my suggestion would, he believed,
aid greatly towards the adoption of the
resolution before the United States Congress.
It was very interesting to me to have their
opinion that, instead of deleting the words
"by the United States of America" from the
resolution, we should add to it the word
"Canada". If this view finds favour with the
Senate, I think the results will be more
satisfactory than would be attained by any
other form of words.
Thus far the matter has not been debated
at length in Congress. In the Senate it was
referred to a subcommittee of the Senate
Foreign Affairs Committee. Probably many
of you have read the debates and the questions which have been asked. There, at the
moment, the maltter stands. If this resolution
were to pass with the amended wording I

have suggested, it would then read: "That
the Senate of Canada do approve of the calling by Canada and the United States of
America of a convention of delegates" and
so on to the end of the resolution. If this
should meet with the approval of the Government of Canada and the Senate of the
United States, we should then suggest that the
convention be held in Canada.
I made that suggestion over the telephone
to these gentlemen, and they expressed themselves as highly favourable ta the proposal,
and said that it would be acceptable in the
United States. They even went so far as to
suggest that the place of meeting should be
the city of Quebec, where other international
conventions have been held.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I suppose I am now actually
closing the debate, but perhaps, with the
unanimous consent of the Senate, we might
have a further discussion on these two proposals. The first one is to delete the words
"the United States of America" so that the
resolution would become a general expression
of opinion that a convention should be held.
The second suggestion, and the one which I
prefer, is that the resolution should be

re-worded so that it would be a joint invitation from Canada and the United States.
In conclusion I may say that the suggestion
that Canada issue a joint invitation with the
United States, and that the conference be
held in this country, would meet with great
favour by the Canadian people. I am more
or less at a loss to know how to proceed now.
I should like to get an expression of opinion
from the members, and particularly from the
government leader in the Senate with regard
to the suggestions which I have made.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If the leader is not willing
to express an opinion, I am quite willing to
adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have no opinion to
express, and I do not know what complications might arise from this.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My suggestion is that, with
the unanimous consent of the house, honourable senators should be allowed to express
an opinion if they wish to do so. Otherwise, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. Marcotte:
That in the opinion of the Senate, whenever an
amendment to the Constitution of Canada is made,
or is to be made, requiring the consent of one or
more of the provinces, the said consent can only
be expressed by act or by resolution of the legislature or legisIatures of the provinces concerned.

Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
I shall just take a few minutes of your time
to close the debate. Actually, if it were not
that I wish to thank those who participated
in this discussion, there would be little to say,
because I have no remarks to make by way

of rebuttal, a privilege usually accorded the
proposer of a resolution.
First, I should like to thank the seconder
of my resolution (Hon. Mr. Veniot), and congratulate the honourable senator from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) upon his learned
exposé of the rights, duties, powers and ambitions of our provinces. We disagree on certain
points; but this is not to be wondered at,
because lawyers always differ about something. The honourable gentleman is entitled
to his opinion about family allowances, just
as I am entitled to mine. I would tell him in
the most kindly way that I would be ready

to defend my opinion in court-and I am sure
that ho would be just as ready to defend his.

JUNE 28, 1950

'

•

But let me thank him most sincerely for
approving my resolution in a general way.
I should also like to thank my honourable
friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
because, in making his point, he proved my
case.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: At the beginning of his
remarks he said that he found very little
difference between us. He said I had argued
that the Senate had been created to protect
the rights of the provinces, and he then asked
why it was that the Senate had so seldom
defended these rights. He made a strong case
and cited incident after incident in which the
Senate failed to protect the rights of the
provinces.
That, honourable senators, is exactly my
complaint. Why bas this not been done? The
Senate was supposed to perform this special
duty, but it did not do so, and that is why I
say that the time bas come for the Senate to
adopt a certain line of conduct. I shall
presently recite the words used by the honourable gentleman from Ottawa to show
that he proved my point. If I had more time
I would elaborate on his speech, because it
contained sound ideas with which for the most
part I agree. The only point of difference
between us is that I maintain that merely
because a duty has not been performed it does
not disappear. I claimed from the first that
the Senate was created for a special purpose,
and to back up my argument I cited several
opinions even beyond those given by the
Fathers of Confederation. I think the unanimous opinion of three of the greatest legal
minds in the country must be accepted.
The noble thoughts of the honourable
senator from Ottawa were clearly expressed
in these words:
Our duty is to see that matters of concern to the
provinces are clearly and definitely presented here,
free from the partisan considerations which in the
past may have stood in the way.

That is the point-"which have stood in the
way". He continued:
Our duty is to see that emphasis is put In the right
place, and that unity of democratic purpose shall

be promoted throughout this land, regardless of
language, race or creed.
I am sure that everyone agrees with this
sound idea.
But my resolution goes, not to the root of
that particular question, but rather to the
main principle enunciated in 1871 and
repeated in 1876 in the House of Commonsthat the duty of the federal or of any provincial executive is to administer, not to
legislate. There is a difference between these
two functions. The principle expressed in
my resolution is easy to grasp, and I think it
is sound. I hope that within a few minutes
the house will endorse it, and my hope is
that it will receive the unanimous approval
given to the same principle in the House of
Commons when 139 members voted in favour
and none voted against.
If we pass this motion we shall endorse
once more the principle that no matter how
strong a prime minister or his government
may be, neither has the right to amend the
constitution. The right of the prime minister
and of the government is to administer, not to
legislate. It is time that prime ministers-at
least one of whom even changed the wording
of a resolution passed in his legislaturerealized the limitation to their authority.
It is not necessary for me to say more. I
thank honourable members for the courtesy
shown to me in this debate. May I add a
very personal note honourable senators? In
recent days I have been suffering deeply, and
I am grateful for the sympathy that you
have shown.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

Prayers and routine proceedings.
PRISONS AND REFORMATORIES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 318, an Act to amend
the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If the house is agreeable, I move the second reading now. I have
asked the Deputy Leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
to explain the bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this bill has been asked for by the Attorney
General of British Columbia, and although
it relates only to that province it is a matter
of some urgency.
Some three years ago British Columbia
introduced the Borstal system for the retraining of young offenders between the ages of
sixteen and twenty-three, and in the session
of 1947-1948 parliament, at the request of
that province, added sections 147A, 147B,
147C, and 147D to the Prisons and Reformatories Act. These sections deal with the
British Columbia Borstal institution which is
known as New Haven. Briefly these sections
provide that any young male person between
the ages of sixteen and twenty-three years
may be committed to the New Haven reformatory for a determinate period of three
months and for an indeterminate period
thereafter of not more than two years, subject
to being released on parole by a board of
parole. They also provided that any prisoner
who was incarcerated at New Haven might
be transferred to the Oakalla prison farm at
any time during the course of his imprisonment. The governing words in that connection are found in section 147C, which declares
that any person in New Haven may be transferred to the Oakalla prison farm for the
unexpired portion of the term of imprisonment to which he was originally sentenced.
A rather unusual situation has just arisen.
A boy was committed to the New Haven
reformatory for a period of three months
determinate and an indeterminate period

after that. He served the three months at
New Haven, and during his indeterminate
sentence he was transferred to Oakalla
prison farm. He obtained a writ of habeas
corpus on the ground that there was no
unexpired portion of his prison term, it being
indeterminate, and he had to be set free.
There is, of course, no intention of dealing
through this bill with that particular case.
The boy benefited by a lapse of the law. But
the Attorney General of British Columbia is
afraid that if the law is allowed to remain
as it is, other persons may hereafter take
advantage of this defect; and therefore, at the
very end of the session, he has requested that
parliament adopt the necessary amendments.
If honourable senators will look at the bill,
which is a very simple one, they will see
that it merely inserts in these three sections,
147A, 147B, and 147C, the words necessary
to make certain that a person may be transferred from New Haven to Oakalla at any
period in the course of his term, whether it
be during the definite part of his sentence
or the indeterminate period thereafter.
I have only to add that this bill was passed
through all its readings this morning in the
other place, and to suggest that this house
may feel disposed to deal with it in like
manner.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is the boy who bas been
mentioned the one who defended his own
case without counsel?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have no knowledge
on that question. I would think it is hardly
likely, because it seems to me that this
would be pre-eminently a matter in which
counsel would raise this very technical
objection.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Can the honourable
senator tell us how the Borstal system is
working in British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have no knowledge
of that, but I am sure that some of the bonourable senators from British Columbia
could answer my honourable friend's question.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If the honourable senator
is inquiring about the Borstal system, I may
say that it is working out exceedingly well.
Instead of younger prisoners being put
among older prisoners, they are placed on a
farm where they are taught various trades;
and one man, instead of a number of guards,
is in charge of them. The system has been
in existence in British Columbia for about ten
years. I think it should be copied by other
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I received a copy of the
bill this morning and have read it very carefully. I have also discussed it with the hon-

CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN

wish ta cail attention af the bouse ta a matter
which I think is of great importance. At least,

in Canada, and theref are shaulci be af concern ta Canada as a whole. A minister of a

Well, we ail remember that same years ago
a certain federal government did not like
what was going on in the province of Alberta,
and word went around that it was not safe ta

maney -out there. When we cansider how

party, I think it is my plain duty ta state
here that I believe he means what he says.

SENATE

I am convinced that risk capital, if invested in
Saskatchewan, has as good a chance as in any
other part of Canada.
Last week when we were considering the
Grain Bill in committee, some gentlemen in
the elevator business appeared before us and
pleaded their case. They pointed out that
they had invested millions of dollars to build
elevators in Ontario with a total capacity of
30 million bushels, but under federal law they
were not permitted to control even 30 per
cent of their storage space. An amendment
to the Act was moved, and we of liberal
thought supported it; but the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) stated here
that the government did not wish to accept it.
When the bill was in our committee the
honourable gentleman from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) was attending a meeting of
the Fisheries Commission at Washington, and
on his return, in discussing another matter,
he said that Canada was fast developing into
a welfare state. He did well to use the word
"state." He also deplored the trend away
from free enterprise, and I flattered myself
for a moment that he was looking at me, but
I suddenly realized that he was in fact looking at that great champion of human rights
and fundamental freedoms, the honourable
gentleman from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). I should like to tell my honourable friend from New Westminster what
attitude the honourable gentleman from
Toronto Trinity took with respect to free
enterprise. He got up and said that he would
like to hear further from the leader of the
government. In other words, he wanted the
leader to tell him again to vote ýagainst this
amendment. It reminded me of some lines
of an old hymn:
I will do what you want me to do, whatever the
cost.
I will be a true soldier; I will die at my post.

Our great champion of human rights and
fundamental freedoms blew up, so we will not
mention it any more.

The two gentlemen who appeared before the
committee thought they had some rights in
connection with their capital investment, but
the suspicion got about 'that these wicked fellows wanted to make a profit on it, and they
may be charged with refusing to co-operate
with the government. We all know what that
means. However, so far as I know they
escaped safely from the building, and I hope
that their notion that private enterprise in
this country still has some rights will not
result in their arrest.
I have mentioned this merely to show that
nothing of the kind could happen in Saskatchewan. In my province, people still are free
to invest their money and carry on business
without the permission of our so-called

"Socialist" government. So none of you need
fear to invest money in the province of
Saskatchewan.
CONVENTION OF NORTH ATLANTIC
DEMOCRACIES
MOTION

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, June
28, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Euler:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by the United States of America of a Convention of delegates from the democracies which
sponsored the North Atlantic treaty and representing the principal political parties of such democracies, for the purpose of exploring how far their
peoples and the peoples of such other democracies
as the Convention may invite to send delegates, can
apply among them within the framework of the
United Nations, the principles of federal union.

views which I respect, expressed by the
honourable senator from Repentigny (Hon.
Mr. DuTremblay)-that the principle of the
resolution was generally acceptable to the
members of the Senate. Therefore, in the
light of the support the motion has received,
and so long as the principle is maintained, I
have no desire to quibble as to the exact
wording.
I moved the adjournment yesterday so that
honourable members might give consideration
to certain suggestions of change in the terms
of the motion. Two of the proposals made
seemed to me to be more worth while than
others. The first was to the effect that the
words "United States of America" should be
deleted from the motion, to avoid any possibility of criticism from the United States that
we are trying to interfere in what they may
regard as their own affair. While I still
believe that this fear is not well founded, I
repeat what I said yesterday, that I have no
objection to striking out the words, "United
States of America". The principle would then
appear in the simplest form, and could not,
I think, wound the susceptibilities of anyone
either in the United States or in Canada.
I should like to emphasize, because I think
it is worth doing, that the whole matter is
being discussed on a non-partisan basis both
in Canada and the United States. As a matter
of fact there is no difference of opinion in the
United States as to the conduct of their
foreign affairs: the two great parties work
together. Evidence of this appeared in the
Congress yesterday, when the Republican
party supported the action of President
Truman with regard to the trouble that has

JUNE 29, 1950
arisen in Korea. A like unanimity was shown
in Canada: yesterday, in the House of Cornmons, the leaders of the four parties concurred
in the policy announced by the Prime Minister
and the Minister for External Affairs. Sa
much for proposai number one.
Nurnber two was my own proposai, made
more or less on the spur of the moment. It
was that instead of deleting the word "the
United States of America", the word
"Canada" be added, thereby making this
country co-sponsor of the invitation referred
ta. The resolution would thereupon read as
follows:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calng by Canada and the United States of Arnierica
of a Convention of delegates-

and So on, in the original form.
I still prefer the later proposai, and for
three reasons: First, that the motion so
worded would tend ta affirm the enhanced
stature of Canada among the nations of the
warld; second, that, according ta authoritative opinior*, such joint sponsorshîp would
be welcomed in the United States and would
be helpful ta those who are trying sa hard
ta secure acceptance by the Senate of the
United States of a motion similar ta our awn;
and third-based upon an opinion expressed
by the honourable senator from. New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)-that the joining of
Canada in the invitation wauld tend to allay
a latent suspicion which may exist in te
mînds of the people of some of the smaller
countries concernied, that the United States
might attempt ta dominate the proceedings of
such a gathering and, indeed, take the
imperialistic attitude of which they are so
persistently and unjustly accused by the
Soviet Union. There may be some point in
this suggestion; but we might as well accept
the fact that the United States, the world's
most powerful democracy, of necessity must
take a leading part bath in the calling and
the conduct of the proposed conference.
At this point may I quote from. a leading
article in' the June issue of "Freedomn and
Union", the magazine I mentioned yesterday.
I do nat know wha wrote this article, but
probably the author was Mr. Clarence Streit,
ta whom reference has repeatedly been made.
It states:
Canada can seize the bail the State Department
is fumbling and run for the touchdawn of the century. The State Department may preverit Congreas
fram gaining for the United States the honour of
calng the Atlantic Federal Convention. It canxot
prevent Ottawa from passing a resalution similar
ta the ane befare Congress, as some Canadians
already propose. That would confront the UJnited
States with an invitation ta explore the possibility
of uniting the Atlantic demacracies by its own
federal principles. It could no mare refuse than
coul4 the motherlands of the two peoples, Britain
and France. who farmed the federal union that is
Canada.

I have received recent information that
strong representations are being macde ta
President Truman that hie should support a
similar resolutian which is before the United
States Congress, with a view ta strengthening
his hand in the crisis which has arîsen sa
suddenly in Korea. My attention was drawn
to an article which. appeared in today's Montreal Gazette, and which perhaps some honourable senators have read. It was fromn a speech
Winston Churchill made yesterday before the
1900 Club in London. He said that the
Korean attack was one of the most obvious
and brutal attacks of aggression, and he said
further:
What hope can there be for the future of the
world unless there is some form of world government which can make its effort to prevent a renewal
of the awful struggle through which we have passed?
Since yesterday I have consulted a number
of my colleagues-I should like ta have seen

more-and. whîle I found no objection ta my
suggestion that Canada be included in the
motion, I have camne ta the conclusion that the
greatest measure of unanimity, which is s0
desirable, would be secured by the adoption
of the first proposai. That would mean striking out the words "United States of America"
and thus making the motion general in its
terms while approving of the principle of the
calling of the convention. I propose a littie
later ta submnit an amendment ta that effect.
Nevertheless, I would again express the hope
that, if the resolution finds f avour both here
and in the United States, Canada might still
'become a joint sponsor of the invitation to the
conference, and further-I want ta emphasize
this strongly--that the conference be held in
Canada.
Samne Hon. Senators:
Hon. Mr. Bouffard:

Hear, hear.
In the city of Quebec.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I suggested the city of
Quebec yesterday, and that certainly would be
quite satisfactary ta most Canadians. There
may be same senators, and I think there are,
wha regard the whole project or proposai as
being visionary, utopian and difficuit to the
point of impossibility. Perhaps that is so; but
in the light of what has happened in the last
fifteen or twenty years-politically, geagraphically and otherwise-who is ta say that
the logic of events and the force of circumstances may not turn the vision into reality.
Hon. Mr. David: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I believe it was Napoleon
who said something ta the effect that the
d-ifficuit is already done; the impassible may
take a littie longer.
I hope this motion will carry, and that it
will carry unanimnously. If it does, the Senate
of Canada will at least have done what it

SENATE
could to contribute to a cause which lies at
the hearts of all peoples, especially in these
days-the preservation of the peace of the
world. I therefore move that the words "by
the United States of America" be deleted from
the motion.
The proposed amendment was agreed to.
Hon. P. B. DuTremblay: Honourable senators, when speaking to this resolution previously, I said that I was absolutely opposed to
it because it would affect the sovereignty of
this country. The resolution as amended asks
for a federationHon. Mr. Euler: No; it asks for a conference.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: It asks that you call
a conference with the object of forming a
union with the United States and other
democratic countries.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I correct my honourable friend? The conference is to be called
for the purpose of exploring the possibilities
of forming such a federal union. No committal is made in the resolution.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: Well, I am against
any exploring at all.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I thought the French liked
to explore.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: I am definitely
opposed to the idea of forming a federation
such as is proposed in this motion. I repeat
that we must be very careful to protect our
sovereignty in every possible way. Let me
remind the bouse that Great Britain recently
refused to take part in the Schuman proposal
to pool the coal and steel industries of
Western Europe.
The Prime Minister of
Great Britain said that his country was not
ready to participate in this economic venture
because of the effect it would have on his
country's sovereignty. I am not in favour,
generally, of the Labour party in England;
but when the vote was taken on this proposal that party showed its patriotism and
defeated the motion by twenty votes. That
clearly indica-ted Britain's position because,
as honourable senators know, the majority of
the Labour party in the House of Commons
is only six.
I should like to draw the attention of
honourable senators to the report of a speech
made about two weeks ago by the Minister for External Affairs, Honourable Mr.
Pearson, to the students of the University of
California. He told them why Canada does
not intend to take any steps towards closer
union with the United States, namely, that

Canadians are satisfied with their present
way of life. Let me quote a few sentences
from this report:
"We feel that we have a sense of social solidarity
and cohesion, or ordered progress, whieh would not
be strengthened by a change to any other system
of government or by amalgamation with any other
country.
We are moreover engaged in an important and
successful venture in incorporation within one state
of two peoples of differing backgrounds-English and
French.... We consider this experiment too significant for us and for others to endanger it by
absorption in any other state."
Mr. Pearson said Canada wished, however, ta
strengthen and broaden her friendly contact with
the United States which was important to Canada
economically.
But here again, he said the "closest possible, the
freest possible trade arrangements, cannot and in
our view need not, mean for us the loss of our
economic independence by a customs union or in
any other way."

That is the opinion of the government of

this country, for Mr. Pearson spoke as Minister of External Affairs. I agree with what
he said, and I believe we should do nothing
to endanger the sovereignty of this country. I am opposed to the resolution because
it seeks authority to inquire into the possibility of some kind of federation in which
some rights which our citizens have fought
for over a long period of time would be
lost. To my mind, even an inquiry into a
possible federation of this kind would be
dangerous.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I understand that the debate now is on the
amendment, but I wish to address a few
remarks to the general subject.
The resolution as presented to us in the
first instance was objectionable to some
degree, in that it asked the Senate of Canada
to approve of an action by the United States
of America. It is not a function of this body
to approve or disapprove of the action of a
legislative body of any other country, and so
while the point is not a serious one I do
feel that the striking out of the words "United
States of America" is an improvement.
But I think- that without offending against
the rule that this body should not undertake
to advise the United States Congress, we can
achieve the object desired by the drafter of
the resolution (Hon. Mr. Euler), namely, that
his proposal be drawn to the attention of
the United States authorities; and it seems
to me that we could accomplish that by
passing a resolution inviting the United
States to join with Canada in an invitation
to the democracies. The honourable gentleman shakes his head, but I do not know
why we in the Senate cannot pass a resolution
calling for action by our own government.
We are part of the government of Canada,
and there is no reason why we should not

JUNE 29, 1950
invite the United Sitates to join with us in
doing something that we consider desirable.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt? My
only reason for declining the suggestion is
that it would be difficult for us to invite the
United States to join with us in sending out
invitations after that country has already
taken -the initiative in the matter.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, that was a suggestion, and if my honourable friend does not
accept it I have nothing more to say on the
point. I told him yesterday that irrespective
of the minor problems of phraseology I was
wholeheartedly with him on the general
principle of his resolution, and that I would
vote for it even if it was not worded exactly
as I might prefer.
It was not possible for me to speak on
this motion earlier, but I can assure honourable senators that that was not because of
any lack of interest on my part in the
proposal, and I ask the indulgence of the
house while I say a few words about it
now. The trend of our times is towards
expansion and co-operation. In its early
days England was divided into six little
warring nations, and consequently was
so weak that it could not resist the raids made
by the Danes. But for three hundred years
there was a gradual process of consolidation
going on, and finally all the kingdoms of
England became shires or something of the
kind in one united kingdom. So soon as
that union was brought about the raids from
abroad ceased, for England was able to
repel invaders and to keep her coasts
inviolate.
An excellent illustration of federation in
more modern times is furnished by the United
States. At the time of the Declaration of
Independence there were a number of incipient wars over boundary lines between
the then independent states of North America,
but as soon as the states federated the disputes were settled. Today those incipient
wars are forgotten; indeed, most people are
not even aware that there were such wars.
Many of the world's present troubles are
caused by the anarchy that exists in the rule
of law and governmental matters. I believe
that the only remedy for these troubles is
some system whereby, through the combined
strength of all the democracies, obstructionists and disturbers of the peace may be
appropriately dealt with. And I do not see
how such a system can be brought into being
and continued in successful operation over
the years unless we organize some kind of
super-government, to which everyone of our
national governments would assign a sufficient
amount of power for our common defence.
Just how much power would need to be

transferred for this purpose is probably one
of the matters to be explored. Certainly
every nation would have to hand over a good
deal of the military power which it now
maintains under its own control. It may be
that in combining for defence purposes we
could at the same time get rid of trade
obstructions and bring about economic
co-operation of a kind that is impossible to
accomplish now. It seems to me that questions such as these can be worked out only
at an international conference. For that reason
I heartily approve of the idea of a conference
on this subject where the problems it raises
will be discussed and clarified; and I have
every sympathy with the final purpose of
such a movement,-the combining of the
strength of the peace-loving nations of the
world to resist aggression, to bring about
peace, and to suppress those who would disturb the lives of us all.
There is one little point that I ought to
make. It was suggested to me by a colleague
on my right. My honourable friend from
Waterloo did not accept another suggestion
I made with regard to his resolution, but
he may

accept this

one because it

is

so

inconsequential. The first "of" in this resolution is not necessary:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling... of a Convention.

I think it ought to read:
That the Senate of Canada do approve the calling
. . . of a Convention.

The "of" is unnecessary. But that is a small
matter.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am quite willing to accept
that suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I offer it merely as a
suggestion.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: In supporting
the amended resolution of the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) I
would like to refer particularly to the views
of my honourable colleague from Repentigny
(Hon. Mr. DuTremblay). He seems to regard
the idea of national sovereignty as sacrosanct,
and unchallengeable by the broader interests
of the world at large. I shall not speak long
on this point, but it may meet the issue he
has raised if I ask whether the members of
this body or of the House of Commons would
insist today that the "national sovereignty"
of Korea must be observed strictly, in the
sense that my honourable friend employs the
term in relation to Canada's participation in
a broad discussion of the possibilities of federal union.
In this resolution the extent to which
national sovereignty shall be yielded, or
implemented, is not involved. The point of
the motion is very clear: that, in view of the

SENATE

developments which have brought the diff erent parts of the world more closely together,
whether they like it or not, those who profess
d-emocratic forms of government should
attempt to organize themselves in a system
which will protect the world from such violence as has afflicted it in the last ten years.
I do not think that, specifically or by implication, the motion suggests that national sovereignty should be sacrificed in any measure,
great or small. Wh-at is involved, it seems to
me, is a matter of ways and means.
In connection with the United Nations
charter we are, by virtue of the article relating to military contributions, bound by the
decisions of the United Nations. At this
moment we are awaiting instructions from
that body as to the contribution Canada might
make to the defence of Korea. Parliament
favoured that proceeding when it passed the
United Nations charter which embodies the
article.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: Yes, but the action
is voluntary.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Quite true.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: We are told that
the United Nations is a wholly voluntary
organization. But thi-s union would be obligatory: we would give up certain rights.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No. I submit to my
honourable friend that what is proposed by
this motion is exactly simil-ar to what we do
in connection with the United Nations charter.
When the time comes to determine the exact
extent to which our national sovereignty
might be affected we can decide our course,
just as we can determine it if, as a result of
this Korean trouble, suggestions for participation are presented by the United; Nations.
It will be for the Parliament of Canada to
decide how far our support shall go. But as
a member of the United Nations, and under
the terms of the charter, we are required to
consider the decisions of the military council.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: A condition of this

United Nations. The Minister of External
Affairs, when he spoke in the other place on
Monday, June 5, in relation to the conterence
of the British Commonwealth countries at
Ceylon, which he attended, stated, as reported
in House of Commons Hansard, page 3191:
We are hopeful that, whatever form of organization eventually emerges. it will develop into an
important agency for social and economic co-operation between free Europe and free North America;
co-operation which may one day lead to an Atlantic
commonwealth of free states.
That is the statement in which our Minister
of External Affairs commits -this country to
the broad policy; and all my honourable
friend's resolution does is to ask that this very
proposition be discussed in a convention.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: Excuse me, but
actually the government cannot do anything
without consulting parliament; it cannot go
to war without submitting the question to
parliament. But if our represenýtatives go to
a meeting and pledge this country, because
of such association, to go to war, consultation
is not possible: the thing is done.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is not the intention
of the motion at all.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: You abandon your
sovereignty. That is what England does not
want to do, and it is what we should be
careful not to do.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I ask my honourable
friend if he will not agree that this resolution

does not approach anything as definite or
specific as he has stated. Before any such
result could follow, the decision of parlia-

ment would be necessary. All we are doing
here is to suggest that a conference should
be called for the purpose of discussing these
things.
Hon. Mr. DuTremblay: Discussing what?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is all. After that,
parliament can decide to what extent action
should be taken.

The Hon. the Speaker: The question,
or any other proposition is that we should be

REPORT OF COMMITTEE
I am trying to show is the similarity between
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the obligation implied in this motion and the the report of the Special Committee on
obligation involved in our membership of the Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

JUNE 29, 1950
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) had to leave the
chamber a few moments ago. As the house
will recall, he adjourned this debate yesterday
afternoon because he wished to consult the
government as ta whether it desired to adopt
any attitude towards this report. The leader
has advised me that he has not had time to
consult with his colleagues, and that therefore the government takes no attitude with
respect to this report.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If no one wishes to speak
now, could the debate be adjourned until
tomorrow?
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
I wish to say a few words about this report.
I would suggest that it be tabled rather than
adopted at this session.
First of all I wish to highly compliment the
chairman (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and members
of the Special Committee on Human Rights
and Fundamental Freedoms upon the splendid way in which they carried out their difficult assignments. At the outset it would seem
quite simple to formulate a principle which
everbody would approve, but the more simple
the principle the more difficult it is to formulate.
I have examined this report carefully and
I do not find in it anything objectionable.
Actually I should be pleased to see a bill of
rights drawn up that would prove acceptable
to all Canadians. I feel, however, that we
would be acting too hastily if we were to
endorse the report at this late stage of the
session. It would seem to me that if we
desire to formulate an acceptable bill of
rights, we should give to the public at large,
and to the various organizations which are
especially interested, an opportunity to study
this report and express their opinions about
it.
In my opinion some of the articles contained in this report properly come under the
jurisdiction of the provinces. For instance,
article 14 reads:
(1) Everyone has the right to own property alone
as well as an association with others.
(2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his
property.

These clauses deal with exclusively provincial
rights, and no law passed by the Parliament
of Canada would prevent provincial legislatures from having jurisdiction over the
property of individuals, companies or organizations. An effective bill of rights must be
founded on a basis of provincial and federal
co-operation, otherwise such articles as the
one I have just cited, if placed on our statute
books, would be without meaning.

Let us refer also to article 18:
(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the

government of the country, directly or through
freely chosen representatives.
(2) Everyone bas the right of equal access to
publie service in the country.

I do not know that I entirely agree with
this principle, and I am not sure that it does
not go too far. Many people across Canada
feel that we should not be deprived of the
ability to exercise the right of preventing
communists from being appointed to the public service of this country. We feel that if a
man has subversive ideas and wishes to overthrow our form of government, he should not
have access to any public service in Canada.
In any event, this matter is one that I should
like to look into more deeply. I do not say
that the principle is wrong or that I disagree
with it, but I should like to have time to
examine it further. I would suggest to the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that this year he should
merely table his report. The session is rapidly drawing to a close, and if the report
were tabled, we would have an opportunity to
discuss it next year. Many of our colleagues
are absent, and neither they nor the people
of Canada have had an opportunity to study
the report and come to 'any conclusion about
it. Further, provincial representatives should
have an opportunity to discuss the principles
involved in the report. We must remember
that within a few months there will be a federal-provincial conference, and that it would
present an opportunity for establishing a basis
for federal and provincial co-operation in
drawing up a bill of rights which would preserve the respective rights of the dominion
and the provinces. If my honourable colleague from Toronto-Trinity accepts my suggestion, at the next session of parliament,
after all honourable senators have had time
to study the principles embodied in the report,
we shall have ample opportunity for full and
free discussion. At that time honourable senators may even deem it wise to refer the
matter back to the committee.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I will not detain the house long. Last
session the motion dealing with human rights
and fundamental freedoms was withdrawn
after an interesting debate, which I followed
closely. That motion, like the one passed this
session for the appointment of a special committee, arose out of a resolution adopted by
the United Nations.
I have been much interested in the proceedings of the committee, and I cannot agree
that our best course now is to table its report.
The committee, set up by the Senate, heard
a good deal of evidence from witnesses, some
of whom took great pains to make a good pre-

SENATE
sentation and it seems to me that its report
should have a more dignified dénouement
than mere tabling, which my experience suggests would be equivalent to throwing it out
of the window.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The subject dealt with
in the report is not new. The feature that
most appeals to me is the rcommendation that
parliament adopt a declaration of human
rights. I could speak at some length on the
desirability of such a declaration, because I
think that since the beginning of self-government here the people of this country have
lacked a philosophy of attachment to the soil
on which they live. I believe that the need
of such a philosophy as a basis of spiritual
and moral aspiration by our people is great
indeed.
The exact terms of the bill of rights could
be left to a specially selected committee, as
suggested. I think it is possible for the federal and provincial authorities to agree on
procedure in amending the constitution, to the
end that we may have one that is really our
own and which we can amend without appeal
to the Imperial Parliament. When we are
able to say that we have a truly Canadian
constitution, that will be the time to underpin it by a fundamental affirmation of our
rights of citizenship.
Some approach to an affirmation has been
made already in the Citizenship Act, but that
does not go quite far enough. It declares the
citizenship of newcomers to this country and
identifies their status with their future life in
Canada. But it seems to me that far more
than that is required to bring home to future
generations born in this country a sense of,
attachment to and aspiration on behalf of
their native land.
As I have already mentioned to some of
my colleagues, I consider that the submission
made to the committee by Professor Lower of
Queen's University, Kingston, and published
in the committee's proceedings, is i'self worth
all the trouble and expense incurred through
the establishment and operations of the committee. Professor Lower has made a most
illuminating statement on the whole question
of human liberties and democratic rights in
Canada, and I should much dislike to see
that document buried at this time through the
tabling of the committee's report.
The Hon. the Speaker: Will the honourable
senator permit me to point out that in my
opinion the report cannot now be tabled?
The motion before the house is for concurrence in the report, and it is for honourable
senators to express their pleasure in the
adoption or rejection of that motion.

Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
was a member of this committee, and I must
confess that I assumed the duties of membership with a great deal of indecision. A good
many persons had said to me that in this free
country our liberties were so obvious that no
bill of rights was needed. However, when
attending the committee's meetings I was
much surprised to find how the idea of a bill
of rights had caught the imagination of the
people. The witnesses who appeared before
the committee, speaking for themsleves or
on behalf of organizations, were for the most
part persons of some prominence and well
qualified to discuss the subject, which they
did in an excellent manner, and I became
enthused with the subject. The general
impression seemed to be that while rights
as between one citizen and another are well
understood, there is a vagueness as to both
the duties and privileges of our people as
citizens of the state. As I listened to the
discussion I felt that our constitution should
contain a declaration setting out definitely
the rights of our citizens in relation to the
state.
Most of the witnesses agreed that we should
wait until an appropriate time before enacting a bill of rights, and I think this view is
implied in the report. The feeling was that
we have a big job on our hands in bringing
about a change whereby we shall be able to
amend our own constitution within Canada,
and that nothing should be done that might
endanger or confuse the negotiations going on
to that end. However, when we do acquire
full power to amend the constitution, there
will be no getting away from the necessity
of having it set out the rights of the people
in terms clear and easily understandable.
In our history books we read of the Magna
Carta, the declaration of rights conceded by
But that was not the first
King John.
declaration of iýts kind. Henry I, of Normandy
who reigned shortly after the conquest,
thought that he would get the English people to like him if he married a Scottish princess, the daughter of King Malcolm. But as
a condition of marriage she demanded that
he make a declaration of the rights of the
people. Being enamoured of the princess,
he did this, and one hundred copies of the
declaration were deposited in cathedrals and
monasteries throughout the country. However,
after the marriage the King promptly forgot
his declaration. Gradually the righs of the
people were restricted more than ever, until
in time there came the crisis which was
ended with the signing of Magna Carta.
When Magna Carta was being discussed, one
of the parties-I think it was the Archbishop
of Canterbury-drew to the attention of the

JUNE 29, 1950
barons that there was an existing bill of
rights which cauld be used as the basis of the
charter. He showed them the bill of rights
which had been granted by King Henry at
the instance of "gooci Queen Mold."' This
was the foundation of Magna Carta-anather
evidence of the great influence of women.
We like ta talk about the liberty of the
subi ect, and I think it is a matter which in
these days can well occupy our attention.
Even in this country, I believe, -a bill of
rights is needed. I think it should be drawn
up in a broad way, with a national objective.
Admittedly there are provincial rights to be
guarded: indeed, most of the instances of
invasions of rights which were cited before
the committee were drawn from the provincial field. There was, for example, the Prince
Edward Island labour law; there was the
padiock law ini Quebec; also certain Alberta
legislation wbich has been declared ultra vires.

It is a provision of Magna Charta that
a man shall not be imprisaned or punished

and the parliaments af Canada far over thirty
years, and I have naticed the tendency ta

cheques", the use af arders in council, and
and the invasion of the rights af parliament.
These criticisms made quite an impressian
upan the people o! the country. But we found
that as time went an the same objectionable

nowadays. The gavernment needs arders in
counicil. What may be gaad law taday may
be bad law tamorrow; and there must be
flexibility in this regard.
We are told that parliament makes the
law. My experience is that parliament makes
very few laws; usually it appraves what has
already been dane or has become a palicy
o! the government. A bill must, be very
bad to be rejected by parliament after it
has been officially introduced and spansared.
When the government brings in legislatian
it expects ta have it passed. With changing
canditions, a bill o! rights would be a constant safeguard of fundamental freedoms,

because violations could be referred ta the
courts who could say, thus f ar and no further

Today the machinery o! government is 50
complex that it needs many technicallytrained civil servants, ta prepare legisiatian
and pilot it through the committees o! parhiament. We know what happens. These
experts came befare us and we hear what
they have ta say; but the hearing is really

experts. If the subi ect-matter affects some
big corporatian which sends agents here ta
protect its interests, then we may see a real
battie between the experts of bath sides.
It seems to me that in the process of legislatian seriaus encroachments have been made
on the liberties of the subi ect. Recently I
saw an example of this tendency in relation
ta so simple a matter as the inspection o! flsh.
By the terms af the law, if a man is "presumed" ta have committeed an offence, the
inspector may go so far as ta arrest that
man and put hlm in j ail. A fundamental
freedom is that guilt must be proven by witnesses.

Mr. Speaker, only a relatively few me:nbers are present today, and I was wondering
whether it would be too much to ask you to
notify absent senators by letter of the invitation from the Swiss Chancellor.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I say just a few words on this matter?
I was one of the delegates to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in England
two years ago, and we received there a similar
invitation to attend a conference on moral
rearmament in Switzerland. Though the invitation was most attractive, I personally was
unable to accept it; but I understand that
it was accepted by the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), the Honourable Gaspard Fauteux, then Speaker of
the House of Commons, and Mr. A. W. Stuart,
M.P. They returned from the conference
greatly inspired by its high purpose and
keenly interested in what they had seen in
Switzerland itself. It occurred to me that any
senator or member of the other house who is
desirous of accepting the present invitation
might obtain information from one of these
gentlemen.

me and the invaluable assistance so freely
given me during the past year? May I also
at this time place on record some few facts
bearing on the advantages accruing to both
the old Canada and the new Province of
Newfoundland as a result of the Act of Union
of last year?

Strategically and economically this union
is of profound importance to Canada and
North America as a whole. By this union
there has been added to Canada a territory of
about 155,000 square miles, with its industries
and resources, and a population of about
348,000 people. Newfoundland's insular -position off the coast of North America makes
easy her access to marine transportation to
the markets of the world; thus her export
production, under normal conditions, enjoys
low transportation costs to a large part of the
world markets.
The coastal waters of the island of Newfoundland are probably the largest and best
fishing grounds in the world. As early as the
sixteenth century these fishing grounds were
being exploited by European fishing fleets
and were contributing greatly to the fishing
trade of Western Europe; and, fortunately for
us, they still are. Exports of frozen fresh
fish to the United States are increasing, and
the fishing industry of Newfoundland is alive
to the advantages of developing this expanding and profitable market. The total value of
our fishery products last year-a substantial
part of which were sold in dollar areas-was
approximately $35,000,000.
The deposit of red hematite iron ore on
Bell Island-the only large iron ore deposit
on tide water in North America-is one of
the largest of its kind in the world. Over
forty million tons have been mined and
exported during the past half century, and
according to surveys there are submarine
reserves estimated at four to five hundred
million tons.
The export value of the pulp and paper
products of the two big mills at Corner Brook
and Grand Falls was around $32,000,000 last
year. The greater part of this export was
to the United States, and brought to Canada
much needed dollar exchange.

calcium content. Mineral and ore products
associated with pre-Cambrian formations on
the west coast of Newfoundland include iron,
molybdenite, garnet, mica, labradorite, graphite, good sandstones, fluorspar, pyrophyllite,
barite, lead, stones-some of which are
natural cement rock-copper, zinc, gold, silver
and some manganese. Areas of Cambrian rock
scattered throughout the east end of the
island contain sandstones, slate, manganese,
limestones-some of which are natural cement
rock-and some phosphate.
Newfoundland's strategic position as an air
base on the shortest route from North America
to Europe was recognized early in the war
and led to the construction of the large airfields at Gander and Torbay on the island, and
at Goose on the Labrador. Athwart the
shortest sea and air route between North
America and Europe, Newfoundland holds a
unique position in transatlantic'transport, and
one which will increase in importance. The
United States Govern.ment established air
bases at Argentia on Placentia Bay, and at
Stephenville on the southwest coast. Gander
airport is located in the middle of the island.
It is equipped to service the largest transatlantic planes, and bas become one of the
most important international airfields. It was
the acquisition of the great Gander airport
tha-t gave Canada the bargaining -power which
enabled our representatives to acquire for
Trans-Canada Airlines the profitable New
York-Montreal run, which hitherto they had
been unable to secure.
Goose airport in Labrador is an alternative
base to Gander, and from a strategical standpoint is without a doubt the most important
base on the North American littoral. It is
notably free of fog, and aircraft when unable
to land at Gander because of fog are rerouted via Goose, which is always open.
Coal seams are known to exist in various
parts of the island, but have not proved to
be commercially exploitable.
The waterpowers of Labrador constitute
one of the largest reserves of hydro-electric
energy in Canada. The power site at Grand
Falls on the Hamilton river ha's an estimated
capacity of some 4,000,000 horsepower;
Muskrat Falls, near Goose Bay, also on the
Hamilton, has a potential of some 1,000,000
horsepower, and other large power sites exist
on other rivers.
One only has to look at the map to realize
that Newfoundland, along with Labrador,
holds geographically one of the most strategical positions in the world. In the nineteenth century and earlier, when the navy
was supreme, England gathered into the
British Empire the most stra-tegical naval
bases of the world-Gibraltar, Aden, Malta,

the Falkland Islands and many others; but
conditions have changed, and air power has
superseded naval power in this century.
Two important consequences of the recent
war have been the shift of power to North
America, and the closer association of the
United States and the British Commonwealth
for ýthe preservation of peace and security.
In the North Atlantic region this means increasing co-operation in defence between
Great Britain, the United States, and Canada.
Together they can hold the North Atlantic,
and if the North Atlantic is secure, aid can
be provided to Western Europe should it be
the victim of aggression. Strategically, the
Newfoundland region is the western anchorbase for holding the North Atlantic. It was
of the utmost importance to the future of
Canada that at the very moment in history
when she was called upon to play a more
responsible role in the North Atlantic, Newfoundland should join Canada. The accession of Newfoundland thus enables Canada to
fulfil its destiny as a North Atlantic power.
The real wealth of the world is not money
or gold, but consists of raw materials which
come from the basic industries-mining, lumbering, fishing and agriculture.
Of these
four, Newfoundland possesses the first three
and, in addition, unlimited waterpower.
What has been the history of territories
that possessed vast raw materials, similar to
Newfoundland? Take Louisiana for instance
-Napoleon
took
Louisiana
from
the
Spaniards and sold it to the United States
for $18 million. It was a wild country,
inhabited by Indians with little or no development and no transportation; but in the years
since it has been developed and cut up into
four or five states. If anyone today offered
the United States $50 billion for this territory, he would be laughed at. Can anyone
tell me that Louisiana was not a great investment?
Again, take the case of Alaska-known in
the early days as the "Ice-Bçx" or "Seward's
Folly". What a bitter fight took place in
Congress when a bill was introduced to take
over Alaska from Russia for $8 million. However, the sponsor of the bill would not give
up, and the bill passed. Alaska at that time
was inhabited only by Eskimos. However,
development took place, and the United
States has taken out of Alaska well over a
billion dollars in raw materials, and there are
billions remaining. It is a prosperous country
and very strategical. In fact, like Newfoundland, it is a Gibraltar of the air. Does anyone
think that the United States today would
look at $8 billion for Alaska, let alone $8
million?
The records show that after Alaska became
part of the United States, Mexico made an

JUNE 29, 1950
offer to sell to the United States, Lower
California and the State of Sonora. Again
looking at the map, you will see what a
wonderful harbour Lower California contains-the harbour that the Jap submarines
sneaked into during the last war. However,
at that time the United States Congress
thought they had such a poor bargain in
Alaska that they would not accept the offer
to buy Lower California, and the $5 million
deal was turned down. What would the
United States give today for this strategical
territory? It is not likely they could acquire
it at any price. It is too late. Mexico realizes
the value of it.
Coming back to Newfoundland, what is
needed for its greater development is selfevident and elementary. Raw materials are
not of much use to a country unless it has
modern transportation-up-to-date railways,
wharves, harbour facilities, steamship lines,
good truck roads, etc. These are the things
Newfoundland lack at the present time, and
the things that we hoped to get when we
came into confederation. It is notorious that
with respect to facilities of this sort Newfoundland is far behind other provinces. If
Newfoundland is to pull its weight as a
partner in confederation, economic development is imperative. Public facilities of the
type I have mentioned would go a long way
toward ensuring the maximum economic
development of Newfoundland.
It is no less important strategically that
such services should be provided so that
adequate defence facilities may be available
should a crisis develop in the North Atlantic
region, as it has in the far Pacific. In this
connection I suggest that it is of major
importance that 'a truck road linking the
west coast-Gander Air Base-and the east
coast should be built quickly. The present

east and west coasts are linked by a singleline raiiway. It is also important that naval
and other defence facilities be maintained in
the St. John's area. I need scarcely remind
honourable senators of the important role the
Harbour of St. John's played in the Battle of
the Atlantic in the last war.
We are entitled to be put on an equitable
basis wih New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in
the matter of railroads, truck roads, wharves,
harbour facilities, cold storages, etc. That
means that there should be placed in the
estimates for Newfoundland an annual
appropriation on the same basis as those
allotted to the other Atlantic Provinces, plus
another very substantial amount to gradually
bring Newfoundland up to the same economic
level as the other provinces. We are not
asking for all the things Ontario and Quebec
enjoy, but we do ask that the federal government, through federal expenditures, over the
next five or ten years, put us on a level with
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island. We have shown that we
have the assets to make us a full partner. We
also brought into confederation 348,000 fine,
hard-working citizens-not a communist
among them, and with the development of
our natural resources, we will, in time, return
to Canada nearly everything Louisiana or
Alaska has returned to the United States.
All we ask is that we be given our rights as
regards federal expenditure, so that all our
transportation services will be equal to those
of the other provinces in Eastern Canada, so
that we can get our goods to market in a
modern way and thus bring enormous wealth
to this great dominion.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Senator
Roebuck (Toronto-Trinity) for concurrence in
the report of the Special Committee on
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I see that the resolution which I
had the honour to move stands this morning
in solitary grandeur upon our order paper.
And it may be that if it were not for the
purposes of the record, little need be said
this morning, but I feel that I must make
some comment about the report in closing
this debate. No doubt many honourable
senators will agree that in debates of this
kind, where people express their honest
thoughts, differences may be resolved for
the most part by holding clearly in mind
precisely what is before them for decision.
I feel this is very much the case in this
instance, and that any differences expressed
so far in this debate lie in misunderstandings
or in misapprehension of the precise matters
that are before the house. Therefore, if you
will bear with me, I purpose to make my
answer in the positive way, that is by addressing myself to just what it is we are
determining.
As honourable senators who have read the
report will remember, it opens with the broad
statement that every human being has rights
which flow from his divine creation; that
the brotherhood of man results from the
fatherhood of God, and a fundamental equality among men necessarily follows. I suppose
no one in Canada would take objection to the

statement that man, because of his divine
origin, has rights and that these rights should
be respected and, if necessary, protected.
The report goes on to mention the formation five years ago of the United Nations, and
the adoption of the United Nations Charter
with its assertion of human rights. This was
followed by the universal declaration for
which Canada and most other nations voted.
The report then describes the timeliness of
the subject. Canada is just commencing her
life as a nation, and assuming complete control of her own affairs, both domestic and
foreign, so that this is the time to decide the
philosophical basis of our nationhood. Canadian statesmen have swept away our former
colonial limitations, and we are now endeavouring to agree among ourselves upon a
way to amend in Canada our Canadian
constitution. And the report makes the point
that this is the time, therefore, "to decide upon
the philosophical foundation of our nationhood"-which, as of course no one will dispute, is freedom,-and "to guarantee human
rights and fundamental freedoms to all our
citizens, and to proclaim our principles to
the world."
Having asserted the desirability of some
acknowledgment in Canada of human rights,
the report turns to the practical method of
attaining that end, and it states that the most
effective way of guaranteeing rights is by
incorporation of such provisions in the constitution. It is pointed out that the British
North America Act already guarantees a
number of valued human rights, and the suggestion is that further steps might be taken
in the same direction. To all who are somewhat fearful of what is proposed, I call
attention to this paragraph:
The enactment of a national bill of rights, however, presents difficulties. In Canada, because of
her history and the harmonious association of
peoples of different races, language and religion,
respect for provincial rights as they have been
defined in the past is essential. No informed person
with any sense of responsibility would suggest that
the dominion parliament forcibly invade the provincial jurisdiction. Concurrence, therefore, is an
essential requisite to constitutional progress.

Let no one misunderstand those words.
There is no intention on the part of a single
member of the committee responsible for
this report to advise anything that may be
regarded as, or that might even look like
an invasion of provincial rights.
Our present constitution, the British North
America Act, is a statute of the Imperial
Parliament, and, in the words of the report,
"objection is now taken by Canadians to
legislative intervention by an authority beyond
our shores and not of our own election, even.

JUNE 30, 1950
though such action is taken at our own
instance." I ask my colleagues to note what
the report goes on to say:
For these reasons, your committee is of opinion
that it would be wise to await the time, which we
hope is not far distant, when prospective dominionprovincial conferences will have worked out a
method for the control within Canada of the Canadian Constitution, and agreement has been reached
as to incorporation in the constitution of a national
bill of rights.

Could anything be more explicit or moderate than that? Could anything provide more
time for consideration or be more carefully
designed to avoid possible conflict between
jurisdictions?
The committee, recognizing that time will
be required to bring about an amendment to
our constitution by the method of concurrence, recommends:
That, as an interim measure, the Canadian parliament adopt a declaration-

not a bill-of human rights to be strictly limited to its own
legislative jurisdiction.

That is all that the report advises, a declaration in the broadest terms.
Some opinion is expressed as to what might
be included in sueh a declaration, and I call
attention to the closing words in this paragraph of the report.
The Declaration would also state that every one
in Canada has duties to our Community and is
subject to such limitations as are determined by
law, for the purpose of securing due recognition
and respect for the rights and freedoms of others
and of meeting the just requirements of morality,
public order and of the general welfare and good
government of Canada. Finally, the Declaration
would specify that none of its provisions may be
interpreted as tending to permit any group or
person to engage in activity aimed at the destruction
of the rights and freedoms of the people of Canada.

we should approve in general terns these
professions of liberty, freedom, security, and
so on, in which every member, without an
exception, believes.
We state thatWhat is required in Canada is one grand and
comprehensive
affirmation, or reaffimation, of
human rights, equality before the law and of
security, as the philosophical foundation of our
nationhood.

Who could possibly disagree with that?
Thus will Canadians know of their freedom,
exercise it in manly confidence and be proud of
their country.

Obviously we do need 'something of that
kind, not so much for ourselves in this
chamber but, particularly, for the newcomer
to our shores who has not a full knowledge of
our history or any good grasp of our political
philosophy.
In conclusion, is this suggestion:
The enactment of a Bill of Rights is not however
the last requisite to a free and just society. While
individuals and groups have natural rights, they
have also responsibilities.
Individuals who practise discrimination, who in their daily life invade
the fundamental rights of others, should pause to
remember that this is Canada, a Christian country
in which the spirit of fairness, kindness, courtesy
and understanding is the babis of our well-being
and happiness.

I am proud to be associated with a sentiment of that kind, and I submit it with
confidence to my fellow senators.
Your Committee concludes its report by further
recommending that al men give thought to the
Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man, so
that by common consent the rule of law and
liberty be more fully established and more universally practised to the end that the rights of the
individual be recognized and respected and the
well-being, dignity and security of al humanity
be thus preserved.

That is all there is in this report. What is
not in the report is another matter; and I wish
to comment very briefly on some of the
remarks made by some of my respected colleagues who were not members of the
committee.
The deputy leader of the house stated yesterday afternoon that the leader had advised
him that he had not had time to consult with
his colleagues and that therefore the government could take no attitude with respect to
this report. That stand is entirely satisfactory to me. I think it is absolutely sound.
The report is of the nature of representations
to the government and possibly to others. I
do not see why the government should
concur in it in advance. The most that we

tional, should be carefully though courageously
received; that is to say, every facility for cardrawn. Your committee recommends that the task
be referred to a carefully selected committee,
rying on the investigation and writing the

adoption of a detailed bill of rights. The only from the executive, with regard to it; a welthing before the house is a resolution that come and a kind word; and the assuranceCould there be a more explicit statement
that we are not advocating licence or subversive activities, or proposing in any tvay to
give carte blanche to gangsters to rob their
neighbours, or anything of that kind? It is
explicitly stated that that is not the intention.
Then, though not so stated in the report,
there is the assumption, which I suppose is
a natural one, that in the course of time the
declaration will be embodied in a bill. The
report speaks of the adoption of a national
bill of rights in "due time". What "due time"
is I do not know, but it will not be until after
a very much more thorough consideration
than we have yet given to the details of a
bill of rights. The report goes on to say that--

SENATE
which is hardly required when one realizes
that in the Prime Minister of this country
we have a gentleman of the highest order-that our report will receive courteous consideration. That is all we are entitled to, and,
from my standpoint, all we want. No objection has been made to our proceeding as we
have done and we are free to do what in our
judgment seems wise. That is eminently
satisfactory.
I am sorry that the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) is not with us
this morning, because I wished to thank him
in person for the very kind remarks that he
made with regard to our chairman and the
other members of this committee. He said,
"I have examined the report, and personally
speaking I do not find anything that hurts
anyone." Neither do I. "And I will be glad
to see a bill of rights introduced and accepted
by Canadians." But he thought we should
not proceed too hastily. That is a fair comment, but I would point out that it is five
years since the United Nations adopted its
charter, with its references to human rights;
it is ýtwo years since the universal declaration
was adopted, and Canada voted for it. This
is the second session of the Senate in which
we have discussed this question. Last year
the debate ran on from early in the session
to its very close; and many splendid speeches
of the highest order were made by honourable senators. Then, this session the motion
was introduced in the early stages; and for
eight days the committee heard representations by delegates of organizations with
memberships running into hundreds of thousands, and by men of the highest standing in
their respective communities. For three long
evenings, the committee sat to consider its
report. Every sentence, every thought, every
word in it was weighed, discussed, debated
and finally approved. I make that statement
with a full realization of a fact which I deem
most significant. On the committee were
men of the two dominant faiths of this country-Protestant and Catholic. On it were
representatives of Canadians of French origin
and of Anglo-Saxon origin. Is it not significant that men whose upbringing in some
respects were diverse, although in other respects similar, were able to agree on this
most important and, I think, historic document?
Is it not significant that the members of
French origin and members of English origin
were able to agree on the broad positive
statements contained in this report? This
report is before you today on the authority of
that committee, a.d not alone on my
authority.
The honourable senator from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) said that we should give

Canadians and various organizations who are
interested in a Human Rights Bill an opportunity to study this report and make suggestions about it. As I have already indicated in
my remarks about the report, that is exactly
what we are doing. That is why we advised
a declaration, and that is why we did not
ourselves make a declaration. We suggested
that the declaration and bill of rights be
drawn by a carefully selected committee.
Later on this committee's report could be
discussed by people inside and outside this
house, before any positive action is taken on
the details of its recommendations. The honourable gentleman from Grandville said that
the principles embodied in the report are
definitely of a provincial nature. He mentioned two or three of the sections to be
found in the resolution constituting the committee. But I wish to call his attention, and
that of other honourable senators, to what
is stated in the report.
Your committee was urged to recommend the
incorporation into Canadian law of the United
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
Your committee finds,
Fundamental Freedoms.
however, that the Universal Declaration, as its
name implies, was drafted for general application
and was not designed with special reference to
Canadian conditions with our divided jurisdiction
and individual history. This finding also applies to
the draft articles appearing in the Senate Resolution, most of which are copied from the Universal
Declaration.
Witnesses before your Committee
addressed themselves to the general principles of
Human Rights and Freedoms and scarcely at al
to the items in detail.

And please note this in particular:
Your Committee prefers to express its own
thoughts as applied to Canadian problems rather
than to attempt to base its report on these individual paragraphs.

Thus it may be seen that these individual
paragraphs are not part of the report, and

they are not included in our recommendations
as set forth in the report.

Any contention

that these individual items mentioned by my
colleague might, if adopted in a bill of rights,
infringe provincial jurisdiction, has no application whatsoever to the problem now
before us.
I presume that the drafters of a Declaration would be cogniaznt of what my honourable friend from Grandville has said and
would act accordingly, because the report
specifles in most emphatic terms that any
Declaration which we adopt shall be strictly
within our own jurisdiction. Those will be
the instructions to such a committee. The
honourable gentleman further said that if a
man has subversive ideas, does not like our
form of government and wishes to upset it,
that we do not feel these people should have
access to any public service in Canada. Well,
men of that kind, racketeers like that, should
have access to just one kind of public service, and that is of a warden of a jail. I have

JUNE 30, 1950
ao desire to deny

anybody that public serto upset our freedoms, but
perfectly clear in what I
I refer again to the report:

The declaration would also state that everyone
in Canada bas duties to our community and is subject to such limitations as are determined by law,
for the purpose of securing due recognition and
respect for the rights and freedoms of others and
of meeting the just requirements of morality, public
order and of the general welfare and good government of Canada. Finally, the declaration would
specify that none of its provisions may be interpreted as tending to permit any group or person to
engage in activity aimed at the destruction of the
rights and freedoms of the people of Canada.

My colleague says that he does not say
that the formulation of principle in the
report is wrong or that he does not agree
with it, but that he would like to have time
to examine it a little further. Well, ladies
and gentlemen, there will be plenty of time
both before and after the declaration is
drafted, and before this house assembles to
pass upon the individual details of either
a declaration or a bill of rights.
The remarks made by the honourable
senator from Repentigny (Hon. Mr. DuTremblay) were along much the same lines as
those of the honourable senator from Grandville. My honourable colleague from Repentigny was kind enough to say that a bill of
rights would be a good thing provided that
we took time in formulating it. That is
exactly what we are doing. He further said
that a bill of rights should not infringe upon
the rights of the provinces, and to the extent
of our ability it will not do so. He said that
most of the articles contained in the report
come within the jurisdiction of the provinces.
He too was apparently under the impression
that the detailed items of the universal
declaration as they appear in the resolution
are a part of our report, which they are
not.
It is for these reasons that yesterday I
was advised to table this report rather than
ask for its concurrence. Aocording to the
ruling given by His Honour the Speaker
yesterday it is not possible to table this
report even if we wished to do so. What is
now before this chamber is a motion which
you must decide one way or the other.
You must record whether you are on the
side of freedom as we have expressed it, or
whether you are opposed to it. That is the
challenge which we face today.
Years ago this Senate was constituted for
the protection of minority rights. Minority
rights include the rights of individuals, and
therefore the fundamental purpose of this
body is to protect human rights and fundamantal freedoms. That is our function. I
am sorry to say that for many years there
has been criticism, perhaps lightly taken,
that the Selate of Canada was on the side of
55950-41

privilege, was a protector of big business
and of wealthy interests. That is a misconception, and from my own personal knowledge
I am aware that the friends of the Senate
were delighted when last session this chamber
publicly discussed at great length and with
remarkable earnestness the question of human
rights, as distinguished from property rights
or the rights of monopolists and others. They
were still further delighted when at this
session we passed a resolution constituting
the committee whose purpose it was to
examine and study human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the representatives of
organizations with memberships running
into the thousands appeared before our
committee for the purpose of assisting us.
As I have said before, men of great standing
in their communities came to Ottawa on
their own time after studying the question
and presented us with briefs that are beyond
my ability to praise.
It has been suggested that I withdraw this
motion. Were I to do so, honourable senators
-do not mistake the situation-it would be
interpreted by all those friends of freedom
who have expressed their approval of us in
the past, that I did so because I had to and
that I did so because I feared defeat of
these noble sentiments in this house. Were
I to take an action of that kind I should feel
that I had betrayed those who had placed
their trust in me, and particularly that I had
let down the members of the committee who
honoured me by appointing me chairman of
the committee and giving to me the duty of
presenting this report. At least the friends
of freedom should stand true in a crisis of
this kind. It would be just as well to vote
the report down as to withdraw it meekly
and supinely, because then we should at least
know who were the friends of the principles
set out and who were the enemies. I beg
of you not to ask me to do what-as the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) so aptly remarked yesterdaywould be equivalent to throwing the report
out of the window.
I appeal to my fellow members of this
body to pass the report unanimously. Every
objection that has been made to it so far has
been based on a misconception of its contents, on the belief that it contains something
that it does not contain, and that was deliberately left out. All that the report actually contains is principles with which every single
senator agrees.
I ask my fellow members-for their own
satisfaction, for freedom's sake and having
regard to the status of this body, to join in
unanimous endorsation of this report.
The motion was agreed, and the report was
concurred.

SENATE
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 4
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 319, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1951.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the second
time?
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: I move the second
reading now.
Honourable senators, this is the third
Appropriation Bill that we have had this
session for moneys necessary to meet the
public service of the financial year ending
March 31, 1951. The total amount asked for
With one
by the bill is $1,128,849,330.10.
exception, which I shall explain in a few
moments, the bill is in the form in which
appropriation bills usually corne to us at the
end of the session.
Section 2 specifies the balance required to
meet the ordinary estimates for the session
after deducting amounts which have already
been voted by Appropriation Act No. 2 and
Appropriation Act No. 3 earlier in the session,
that balance being roughly $1,044 million.
I think that the only remark I need to
make on that subject today is that as a
result of the work done by various standing
committees this bouse is much better
acquainted with details of the estimates than
it has been in former years.
Section 3 asks for a sum of $1-2/3 million,
being a special appropriation for unemployment assistance in the Province of Newfoundland. As stated in Schedule B, on page 32
of the bill, this amount is required to meet
certain provisions of the terms of union of
Newfoundland with Canada.
Section 4 covers items not previously submitted to the house; that is to say, further
supplementary estimates, the details of which
will be found in Schedule C, extending from
pages 33 to 47 of the bill. The'total amount
of these supplementary estimates is approximately $82,451,000. I am sure that honourable senators will have looked over the
detailed items, and perhaps the only ones
I need mention are those for flood relief
in Manitoba and fire relief in Rimouski and
Cabano. They are set out in Schedule C,
at the bottom of page 35 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I interrupt for a
moment? I have not seen a copy of the
supplementary estimates; neither has my
deskmate.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Has my honourable
friend not received a copy of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I understood that it
had been distributed.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I have one.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: At the end of every
session supplementary estimates are brought
down in another place so late that there is
little time left to print them and provide
copies to honourable members of either
house. I had understood, though, that copies
of the supplementaries we are now discussing
had been distributed.
The only change in substance between
this Appropriation Bill and those that we
have passed in other sessions will be found
in section 5, which authorizes the Governor
in Council to borrow certain additional sums
as may be required from time to time during
the year. The wording of this section is
the same as was used in previous bills, but
the borrowing power which formerly was
limited to $200 million is now increased to
$500 million. I am advised that the increase
is made necessary because each year we have
been issuing Canada Savings Bonds in
amounts in excess of $300 million. In addition,
at certain times it is necessary to raise
money temporarily to meet extraordinary
payments. This often gives rise to a question
of timing. At certain times our cash position
may be such that instead of refunding maturing issues we can use our cash to pay them
off. When this is done it may later become
necessary to replenish our cash by new
borrowings which, as they are not refundings,
cannot be issued under the authority contained
in Appropriation Act No. 1. Thus, as long
as we are following this financial policy it
is necessary for us to have greater borrowing authority. But the Governor in Council
will not necessarily use this expanded
authority to increase the public debt more
than it would have been increased under
the old authority which was limited to $200
million.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I shall not detain the house very long, but I
wish to make a few remarks with regard to
this bill. In the seventeen years that I havc
been a member of this chamber, this is the
first session when we have given the estimates careful and more or less full consideration. In previous years bills of this kind
came down during the last half hour that
parliament was in session, and we were
supposed in the short time that remained to
give the contents a degree of scrutiny which
was, of course, impossible. We on this side
of the house objected year after year to that
proceeding. I am pleased to be able to inform

JUNg 80, 1050
honourable members that this year, because
the estimates came down in March and were
referred ta the Finance Committee and other
standing committees of the house, they
received what may fairly be described as a
reasonably full investigation.
Ail of us are deeply concerned in keeping
expenditure ta a minimum, and we have been
trying desperately ta do sa. However, I
regret ta have ta say that although we examined the estimates very carefully with that
purpose in mind, recommendations of econamies are limited ta general terms in the
reports of the various committees.
I cannot say that the same close attention
has been given ta the supplementary estimates.
We all know that they cannot be brought
down as early as the general estimates, and
we are used ta receiving them in the last
moments of the session; but I hope that next
year, if it be at all possible, the government
will let us have the supplementary estimates
at least a day or two before parliament is
ready ta prorogue.
That is all I have ta say with regard ta the
estimates in general; but in schedule C of
Bill 319, page 33, I notice among the further
supplementary estimates, the following item:
on western feed
Freight assistance
further amount required . .. $13,000,000.

grains-

It will be remembered that a short time
ago a bill was introduced here ta amend the
Prairie Farm Assistance Act. It was then
explained that the payment by the farmers
of the Prairie Provinces of an amount equal
ta one per cent of the value of the grain
marketed on their behalf was not sufficient
ta provide for the bonuses paid by the government ta the farmers on account of crop
failures of one kind and another, and that a
further sum of about thirteen or fourteen
million dollars was required. At that time
I did not know how much assistance had been
given ta the farmers of British Columbia,
Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces
in the form of payments of freight on feed
grains shipped ta them from the Prairie Provinces. I now have these figures, and I think
I should place them on the record for the
purpose of showing that we who live in the
Prairie Provinces do not get all of the bonuses
provided from the national treasury, but that
farmers in other parts of Canada benefit in the
same manner. In eight years from and including 1941 the amounts paid from the federal
treasury, in the form of freight bonuses ta
help the feeders of Eastern Canada and
British Columbia, totalled nearly $125 million.
Since Newfoundland came into confederation
it also has benefited in the way of freight
assistance, and in three months of the fiscal
year 1949-50 the amount sa expended was
$31,400. This assistance applies ta feed grains

such as oats, barley, feed wheat, corn, mill
feeds and like products, moving eastward and
westward from the Prairie Provinces. It
might be interesting ta honourable senators
ta know that the lion's share of these huge
sums went ta the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Each of them received
approximately $46 million.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who pays the taxes out of
which these payments are made?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not going ta deal
with that. We think we pay our share.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And get your share.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Total payments by provinces are as follows: Ontario, $45,500,000;
Quebec, $45,900,000; New Brunswick, $7,900,000; Nova Scotia, $9,800,000; Prince Edward
Island, $2,900,000; Newfoundland, $31,400;
British Columbia, $12,600,000-in all, $124,600,000.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: Did not the western wheat
grower receive a little extra price because of
that assistance?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I never heard of it, and
I have sold considerable quantities of these
grains.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: As a matter of fact, the
basis was a fixed price.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Moreover, the eastern
feeders were anxious ta have the Wheat
Board made the sole agency for the marketing of these grains, sa that the price would
be kept down and they would get their
supplies more cheaply. The western farmer
was not allowed ta ship his feed grains ta
the United States and other countries which
would have paid a higher price for them.
My final remark with regard to the estimates in general is that I hope the government will bring down next year's estimates,
both general and supplementary, early
enough ta enable us ta examine them and
give them our best consideration. Perhaps
the Senate committees will then have the
courage ta make reports which will recommend certain reductions in federal expenditures.
Hon. Thomas Reid: I want ta say a word
with regard ta the supplementary estimates,
and register a complaint that they were not
received sooner. It is very interesting ta see
what large amounts are now being-in my
opinion-"slipped across". For instance, under
the supplementary estimates for the Department of National Revenue I see a contemplated expenditure of $650,000 ta provide for
advances ta the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. What is all this for? It is just

SENATE
to cover deficits. There seems to be no control over what is done in some of the
departments. The corporation just spends
money and then asks parliament to make up
any deficits that may have been incurred.
There is another item here of $2,907,400 to
cover international organizations, and $850,000 to be spent for the United Nations
expanded program for technical assistance to
under-developed countries. Then there is a
contemplated expenditure of $400,000 on the
Commonwealth Consultative Committee on
South and South East Asia.
Now, there is not one honourable senator
who knows the first thing about some of these
supplementary estimates, and I am serving
notice now that if this sort of thing occurs
next year I shall insist on being provided
with the necessary information before I allow
such expenditures to go through.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the second reading of this
bill. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Duff: On division.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, on division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved the third reading

of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed, on
division.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

After which the Honourable the Deputy
of the Governor General was pleased to close
55950-42

the Second Session of the Twenty-first Parliament of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The North Atlantic Council has made a significant
forward step by the formulation of the principle of
balanced collective forces as the basis of the defence
of the Atlantic community. The government welcomes the decision to have deputies of the Foreign
Ministers appointed ta maintain continuity in the
work of the council.
In order ta further the economic co-operation of
North Atlantic nations, Canada, along with the
United States, has accepted an invitation to become
associated on an informal basis with the work of
the Organization for European Economic Co-operation.
Canada was also represented at the Commonwealth meeting held in Australia ta consider the
means of assisting in the economic development of
south and southeast Asia.
The United Nations has recently been called upon
to deal with a serious threat ta peace in Korea.
Though the situation emphasizes the grave concern
which has long been felt over the f allure of the
Security Council ta arrange for the provision of
forces ta implement its decisions in such cases, the
prompt and energetic measures taken by individual
members on its behalf and in conformity with its
resolutions ta restore and maintain peace in that
area have met with general approval in all the
free nations and will I am sure, dispose them all
to supply such form and degree of co-operation as
may be required.
The government remains convinced that until
there is genuine goodwill among all nations, the
maintenance of peace will continue ta depend upon
the unity and strength of the free nations.
The government is continuing ta give close
attention ta the development of our defence forces.
Measures have 1een enacted ta provide for the
consolidation of existing legislation with respect
ta the armed forces including a purely Canadian
disciplinary code; and ta provide for the procurement of munitions and defence supplies. The
government was gratified by the announcement of
the United States government that a program for
the purchase of defence supplies in Canada on a
reciprocal basis was being developed for the year
beginning on July 1.
Our external trade remains at a high level
despite difficulties arising out of the world-wide
shortage of United States dollars which continues
ta affect overseas markets for certain of our export
products. My ministers are giving constant attention ta the removal of obstacles ta the free flow of
trade between our country and our traditional
customers overseas.
Satisfactory discussions have been held with the
Government of the United Kingdom concerning the
sale of wheat after the completion of the present
contract.
A measure has been enacted ta bring the powers
of the Canadian Wheat Board into conformity with
the provisions of the International Wheat Agreement.
You have renewed the Agricultural Products Act
and have provided legislative authority for continuing the support of prices of agricultural and fishery
products where such support may be required te
reduce the impact of price adjustments.
Legislation was enacted early in the session te
bring additional workers under the protection of
the Unemployment Insurance Act and the protection ltself was exteided by supplenentary winter
benefits.

SENATE
A joint committee of both houses of parliament
has examined carefully the whole question of
security for the aged with a view to providing an
in
essential background of informed opinion
advance of the forthcoming general conference of
the federal and provincial governments.
During the session agreements were concluded
with several of the provincial governments to
implernent the legislation with respect to housing
and also the legislation with respect to a transcontinental highway enacted at the last session.
The Niagara Diversion Treaty between Canada
and the United States to provide for the permanent
regulation of the diversion of water from the
Niagara River for hydro-electric power has been
approved and it is the hope of the government
that, in the interests of both countries, it will
receive the early approval of the Senate of the
United States
A uniform and systematic procedure has been
provided for the publication and tabling in parliament of regulations and orders made by the
Governor in Council or ministers or other agents
of the Crown in the exercise of powers conferred
by statute. You have also approved a measure to
enable corporate Crown agencies to sue and to be
sued in the ordinary courts.
The consideration of the measure to revise the
Indian Act has not been completed. This measure
will be re-introduced at your next session. In the
the
amendments to
among other
meantime,
Dominion Elections Act, 1938, provision has been
Indians to vote in
made to extend the rights of
federal elections.
During the session measures have been enacted
respecting the National Research Council; prize
money; the inclusion of veterans of British and
Allied Forces within the scope of the War Veterans
Allowance Act; Prairie farm assistance; and the
National Film Board.
Bills have also been passed to amend the Canadian Citizenship Act; the Customs Act; the Income
Tax Act; the Excise Tax Act; the Tariff Board Act;
the Judges Act; the Trust Companies Act; the
Loan Companies Act; the Foreign Insurance Companies Act, 1932; the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932; the Railway Act; the
Canada Shipping Act, 1934; the Aeronautics Act;
the National Parks Act; the Northwest Territories
Power Commission Act; the Official Secrets Act;
and the Criminal Code.

The Transitional Measures Act has been extended
to provide for the orderly decontrol of rents.
The spontaneous and tangible expressions of
sympathy for the victims of the Manitoba floods
and the fires at Rimouski and Cabano have been
a gratifying demonstration of national unity. My
ministers felt they were acting with the unanimous
approval of our people in providing immediate
assistance in fighting the floods and fires and in
applying to the disasters of 1950 the principles and
considerations applied in the Fraser River Valley
flood of 1948. As on that occasion the work of the
armed forces was most effective. Joint federalwere
of investigation
commissions
provincial
appointed, and as soon as they could report, an
announcement was made of substantial national
financial assistance for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the devastated areas.
The Canadian section of the International Joint
Commission has been requested to expedite the
investigation into measures required for the future
control of the Red River.
The Greater Winnipeg Dyking Board, appointed
jointly by the federal and provincial governments,
is proceeding with the work of providing flood
protection for the Winnipeg area.
The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration
has been instructed to complete the compilation of
data, much of which has already been gathered,
with respect to flood control in the Assiniboine
River.
The splendid manner in which our people met
these disasters, the efforts and endurance of those
who fought the flood and the fires, and the response
from all parts of Canada and abroad to appeals for
assistance have provided heart-warming evidence
of the feeling of common humanity which exists
in many other countries as well as our own.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have made for
all essential services for the current fiscal year.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
As you return to your homes, I express the hope
that Divine Providence will continue to bless our
people with peace, prosperity and happiness.
