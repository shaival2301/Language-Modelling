Ehe Bebates ut the Senate
OFFICIAL REPORT
THE SENATE
Thursday, January 25, 1934.
The Parliament of Canada having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General -te meet this day for the despatch of
business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers.
OPENING OF THE SESSION
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that be had received a communication
from the Governor General's Secretary informing him thait His Excellency the Governor
General would proceed to the Senate Chamber
te open 'the session of the Dominion Parliament this day at three o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the
Governor General proceeded to the Senate
Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne.
Bis Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance cf the House of Commons, and
that House being come, with their Speaker,
Bis Excellency was pleased te open the Fifth
Session of the Seventeenth Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
You are summoned for the despatch of public
business at a time when there are sound reasons
for believing that the world is gradually
returning to economie stability. I congratulate
you that such improved world conditions are
reflected in Canada by expanding trade,
amprovimg revenues, increasing employment,
and a more confident outlook upon the future.
Canada occupies a leading position amongst
those countries where the evidence of a return
to permanent prosperity is most convincing.
Since I have been associated with you as the
representative of His Majesty in Canada, I
have visited every province of the Dominion.
I have been greatly impressed by the loyalty,
devotion and friendliness of the people, as well
as the high courage with which men and women
were meeting and overcoming abnormal diffieulties in their daily lives.
The Ottawa Trade Agreements have now been
in operation for a fuli year and the results
74728-1

nsn

indicate substantial expansion of CanadianEmpire trade over the preceding year. It is
worthy of note that the Agreements are proving
beneficial to all Empire countries. The trading
position of the Empire in the world has steadily
improved. Canada has again resumed her place
as the fifth exporting nation. Our favourable
trade balances have enabled us to discharge our
international obligations and have greatly
lessened the difficulties of the international
exchange situation.
The temporary trade arrangements made
with Germany and Austria have been further
extended. Canadian products are now receiving
most favoured tariff treatment in those countries in exehange for the grant of our intermediate tariff on their products.
The prices of agricultural products, which
have fallen in recent years te the lowest level
in history, have shown substantial improvement in the last few months. My Government
realize, however, that further increases in price
levels are necessary to insure success to those
engaged in agriculture. You will be invited te
consider legislation designed te facilitate the
efficient and profitable marketing of live stock
and agricultural products.
Members of my Government participated in
the World Monetary and Economie Conference
convened in London in June of last year. The
reports approved by the Conference and the
resolutions adopted by the Bureau and the
Executive Committee, as well as certain agreements entered into by my Government, designed
to mitigate fluctuations in the price of silver,
will be laid before you.
The Conference
adjourned without dealing with many important
subjects, but arrived at conclusions of especial
interest and concern to Canada in respect to
central banks, the gold standard, and the percentage of inetallic coverage essential to the
successful functioning of gold as a medium of
international exchange. During the Conference
my Ministers informally met the representatives
of the United Kingdom and other countries of
the British Commonwealth of Nations, with a
view to the further development of Empire
co-operation; and adopted certain resolutions
with respect to monetary and financial policies,
whieh will be laid before you.
In July of last year, my Government
appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into
and report upon the operation of the banking
and nonetary system of Canada, with particular
reference to the provisions and working of the
Bank Act, the Dominion Notes Act, the Finance
Act and the Ourrency Act, and the advisability
of establishing a central banking institution.
You will be invited to consider legislation for
the establishment of a Central Bank, the extension and revision of bank charters, which were
extended at the last session of Parliament te
the first dey of July, 1934, and to consider
further appropriate additions and amendments
te our banking and monetary legislation.
My Government, acting with representatives
of other wheat exporting countries, as well as
ErifO

SENATE

representatives of wheat importing countries,
have entered into an agreement for relieving
the world market froin the disastrous pricedepressing influence of abnormal surplus wheat
stocks. It is a matter of satisfaction that the
parties te this agreement are co-operating with
a degree of effectiveness which is akeady
reflected in improved prices. The agreement
vill be laid before you.
Since prorogation, my Government made a
public offering of Canadian securities in the
United Kingdom. This was the first time in
over fifteen years that Canada had negotiated
a loan in the Britisi market. The reception
of the loan was gratifying in the extreme,
indicating the high standing of Canadian credit.
My Governmnent have been giving careful
consideration te measures that might be
adopted for the establishment of agricultural
short-tern and intermediate credits; and have
invited representatives of the provinces te study
the means by which practical effect may be
given te the recommendations in this respect
made by the Royal Commission on Monetary
and Banking Problems.
Since prorogation, my Government, under
the a.uthority of the Relief Act, 1933, have
continued te assist financially the provinces ia
the discharge of their constitutional obligations.
My Government have recently concluded a
conference with the representa.tives of all the
provinces, when. after the fullest discussion, it
was agreed that it was desirable, in the national
interest, that assistance te the provinces should
not be wholly discontinued until the return
of more normal conditions. The extent and
method of affording such assistance were left
for negotiation between my Government and the
Governments of the several provinces.
The representatives of the various provinces
strongly approved of the arrangements made
by my Government to care for single, unemployed, homeless men in camps until such time
as they could be absorbed in industry, by
providing thei with employment on undertakings for the national good; and of the provision
made in 1932 for settlement of families on the
land, which has been extended with satisfactory
results. My Government propose further to
promote employment by expenditures on essential public works and undertakings throughout
the Dominion.
Yeu will be invited te consider, amongst
others, measures relating te the Excise Act, the
Companies Act, the Judges Act, and the
Elections Act.

member of the Privy Council. At that time
Sir James also said:
'[bis is a very proper recognition of services
which, to my mind, have been of an invaluable
character, especially those rendered in this
Chaoiber.
For some twenty-three years my
honourable friend bas been an active member
of the Senate of Canada, and has contributed
probably in a greater degree than any other
member of this Chamber to the legislation
which, from time to time, has passed this
House.
No greater compliment could be paid him
than was paid that day, and it has been
practically repeated, in different words, by
my right honourable friend this evening.
I join with the right honourable gentleman
in extending my sympathy te the families of
our departed colleagues.
Hon. THOMAS CHAPAIS (Translation):
It is extremely difficult te add anything te
such eloquent and sympathetic eulogies as
have just been pronounced in this Chamber
in memory of our departed colleagues. I
desire simply and modestly te re-echo these
expressions of sorrow and regret.
The members of the Senate who have
passed te the Great Beyond since last session
were among the most deserving of our esteem.
In the praise bestowed upon them by our
honourable leaders we all concur. May I be
permitted for a moment te lay my tributes
of respect upon three of these tombs which
have just been closed.
Hon. Senator Poirier was the only survivor
among us from an epoci in our parliamentary history with which is identified the
great name of Sir John Macdonald. Noble
Acadia looked upon him as ber most illustrious son and most worthy representative.
Combining literary gifts with a passion for
work, he bas left us a number of valuable
and brilliant productions which have won
admiration net only at home, but likewise
abroad. In this Chamber his eloquence was
especially notable in bis tributes te deceased
colleagues. De we net recall, honourable
members, some of those brief funeral orations
which revealed the high plane of bis thought
and the nobility of bis heart? The works
hie bas bequeathed te bis fellow citizens will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

perpetuate bis name, and he leaves with us
an enduring memory.
Hon. Mr. Béique was the personification of
parliamentary experience, policital wisdom
and legal knowledge. Almost a nonagenarian,
he astonished us by bis constant devotion ta
duty, bis untiring mental activity, bis unfailing memory, the range of bis knowledge of
law, his extraordinary legislative skill. To
the committees of this House he brought the
most enlightening and most fruitful co-operatien. Public legislation of the greatest importance is due te his energetic initiative and
patient toil. He was one of those who always
say, " Non recuso laborem." By bis death we
lose one of the few survivors of the pre-Confederation era. For my part, I shall long
miss bis conversation, rich in reminiscences,
each a fascinating lesson in contemporary
history.
And now may I bid a tender farewell te
my colleague and friend Senator Tessier. Our
relations extended over forty years. But in
later years they bad become more intimate
and more constant. Then it was that I learned
particularly te esteem and appreciate him. Indeed, only those who came into close contact
with bis life could know bis real human and
social worth. His most admirable qualities
were rectitude of mind and goodness of heart.
He possessed te a remarkable degree the
faculty of discernient. Without making much
of it, sometimes even without showing it, he
knew how te apply te words, actions or
character a judgment often caustic in expression and almost always uncommonly accurate. He did net stop at appearances, but
delved down te the reality. Dignified, but
affable, and never failing in courtesy, hc typified among us the gentleman of the old school.
What shall be said of bis kindness and humanity? His humble reticence could net entirely
bide the quiet generosity that alleviated se
much misfortune and distress. Only a kindred
seul, who might be called "the witness of bis
life," and te whom I cannot refrain at this
moment from paying homage, could unveil
the secrets of their beneficent collaboration in
the great work of charity, the noblest that can
be accomplished on earth.
Our deceased colleague would be surprised at
this eulogy, for true humility was one of his
virtues. But I know that in this Chamber,
and outside, and especially in old Quebec, of
which he was one of the most eminent citizens,
a chorus of voices will feelingly bear testimony
te the truth of what has been said.
Hon. Senator Tessier is among us no more.
But bis memory abides with us, as it will abide

Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Bonourable senators, I would not atternpt to add to
what lias already been said about our late
colleagues by the two leaders of the Bouse
and by rny good friend frorn Grandville (Bon.
Mr. Chapais) were it not tijat I bappened to
be very intimate with most of thern. The
grimf reaper has rnowed down rnany who in
the field of polities had grown up to be
leaders of this country. Bornage lias been
rendered our late distinguisbed colieagues.
Their mernory shaîl neyer fade.
I was perbaps one of the flrst in Parliament to know Senator Gideon Robertson intimately, because when lie began to appear as
bead of a very large and inteliectual union
of telegrapli employees it was rny privilege
to, bc Minister of Labour; and, as you rnay
remember, wliat is commonly known as tlie
Lemieux A.ct was first applied in tbie case of
a threatened strike of tlie TDelegraphers' Union
-a strike wbicli would seriously affect the
comrnunity. Tbanks to thbe good offices of Mr.
Robertson, as b'e tbpn was, and to bis knowledge of the Industriai Disputes Investigation
Act, and tbanksalso to bis loyalty not only to
labour, but ailso to capital, tbe strike was
settled and thus was establisbed thýe first precedent of a long line of cases whioli bave since
corne before tie Labour Departrnent.
I can say of Senator Gideon Robertson,
after observing birn very closely from my
place in the Bouse of Commons :and in tbis
Cbarnber, and after foilowing bis brilliant
representation of 'Canada at tlie League of
Nations, tbat he could bave attained to any
position in Canada; and to say tbat of a selfmade man is bigis praise in'deed.
How couid we ever f orget the genial srniie
of our dear friend tbe late Senator Stanfieid,
wbose hurnan kindness perrneated, so to
speak, bis every act? I bave neyer known
birn, eitber in this Cliamber or in the Commons, to be otherwise than of service to bis
feiiow members. 1 tbink be had adopted as
lis motto that of the Prince of Wales,

of tbe Bouse, and in lis wbole parliamentary
career I was neyer able to detect even tbe
siigbtest tinge of partisanship. As lias been
said by my bonourabie friends, lie was a leader
in industry, and the 'Maritime Provinces will

7

ever mourn this straightforward, and honest
business man.
As regards the late Senator Poirier, who
was the dean of this Bouse, we ail know that
he was the representative of the Acadian race.
As a leader and as a man of letters he gave
the best of bis life and intelligence to the
uplifting of bis compatriots. Bis books were
familiar to the Frenchi Academy, from whicb
august body, five years ago, he received a
gold medal for his latest lexicon on the
peculiar cliaracteristies of the Acadian Ianguage. Bis fellow ýcountrymen were justly
proud of hirn, and when the French Republic
gave him tbe decoration of the Legion of
Bonour, from aIl parts of this continent where
there are groups of Acadians or Freneb-Canadians the officiai and noble gesture of France
was cbeered to the echo. Senator Poirier was
a brilliant orator, and a litterateur of note,
and bis writings are a monument to French
literature and foik-lore in Canada.
My esteemed and beloved desk-mate,
Senator Tessier, bas also departed from. our
midst. When I try to, express my personal
feelings at bis passing, words faau me. It
seems as thougb I hear, even to-day, the
beating of the wings of the Angel of Deatb.
Be was a grand gentilhomme. Be belonged
to an old seigniorial family in Quebec. Bis
venerable father, whose features can be seen
in a portrait in the lobby, was a Speaker of
the oid Legisiative Council of Canada and a
Judge of the Court of King's Bencb. Bis
brother, the Bon. Auguste Tessier, and his
nephew, were also Judges of the Superior
C.ourt. Senator Tessier hirnseif was for rnany
years the Speaker of the Quebec Legisiative
Assembiy. Bis .iudgment, bis poise and bis
impartiality were distinct features of the vanious bigb positions lie was called upon to fill.
Above ail things he was fair. In ail bis dealings he was a perfect gentleman. We are al
aware of bis work in th~e social welfare movement. The late senator was the belprnate of
Madame Tessier in this regard, and both of
tbem we-re pioneers in that noble work in the
old province of Quebec. I was by bis side a
few days before his cruel operation, and I
can assure the Bouse that he died braveiy,
witli tlie smile of tbe Happy Christian WarriorAs to the late Senator Béique, what can I
add to wliat bas been so weil said by tbe
two leaders of tbýe Bouse? He was an exampdar
to ail the young men of tny generation. Born
the son of a farmer, he was from. the early
days of bis youtb a diligent, persevering and
tboirougli-going worker. Bis friend. and law
partner, Sir Louis Jetté, was wont to say to
the students of tbe law faculty of Laval:

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
lionourable
senaters, I shahl net presume te add te wbat
bas been said by the twe leaders of the lieuse
and otber distinguisbed inembers in reference
te several of our celleagues wbo bave passed
te the Great Beyond since Parliamont prorogued at the end of last session. I do feel,
bewever, that I should rise to-nigbt te speak
of ene of 0cr members wbo bas passed on,
if only for tbe reason tbat I had enjoyed a
longer persenal acquaintance witb him, 1
tbink, than any other membor of this lieuse.
I refer to our departed celleague and friend
the late Senater Robertson.
I feel sure that I knew Senator Robertson
for many years before ho or I ever tbeugbt of
taking part in the public life of Canada. I
had cerne te know bis wortb as the representativ'e of a class tbat bas reeently been
brougbt te eur attention as "forgotten citiHon. Mr. LEMIEUX

zens." For many years
before
Senator
Robertsou came jute public life I bad kuewn
that ho was first, last and ail tbe time looking
for an epportuuity te botter the cendition ef
semeone less fortunate than bimself. I shaîl
always tak-e ceusiderable pride in the fact
that I ivas eue of the deputatien wbich pressed
the dlaim that. the views of labour could
botter ho heard in this Chamber if its mcmbership includc.d a representative of labour.
I eau recaîl many instances ef the ability
of Senater Robertson te perferm wbat in my
judgment ne other single citizen ceuld bave
performed under the same circumstances and
iu the same way. Let me givie two 'brief illustrations.
Iu 1916 a strike was duo te be called
centering at Winnipeg and extending frem
the Atlantic te the Pacifie. Botb sides were
at daggers drawn, and eacb was fearful ef
giving any advantage te tbe other by making
any shoew wbatever of giving way. One merniug Senater Rebertson arrived in Winnipeg,
and, te put it shortly, ivithin twenty-feur
heurs hoe left that city with everything settled
amicably and satisfacterily. No ether man
in Canada ceuld bave secured the confidence
of thos.e wbo represented labour at that time,
uder the cenditions thon prevailing, and I
doubt wlietber any other man would bave
been able te meet the viewpeint ef tbe other
side te the dispute.
Again in 1918, in the months of July and
Auguat, we were in the threes of the World
War, net knewing what each day might bring
forth. liarmeny and ce-eperatien ameng the
people ef Canada were necessary. Senater
Robertson underteek te make pessible the
creation of Canadian Railway. Board of
Adjustment Ne. 1. I remember travelling
more than eigbt hundred miles te attend a
mneeting in Mentreal, and the first tbing I
heard when I arrived was that wbat was propesed was impessible of accomplisbment fer
this, that, er the other reasen. But it was
doue within a very few days, and for the
past fifteen years or more that Board lias
functiened from time te time, wbenever
treuble develeped cencerning six of the big
standard organizations on the Canadian railways.
Probably more than any other member of
this Chamber, I shaîl miss the courage, tbe
counsel, the honesty of purpose of Senator
Robertson. Iu conclusion may I say that in
my humble
.iudgment the code which
governed the heneurable gentleman througheut beth bis public and bis private life is
very bappily expressed in the words of the
philosopher whe wrote:

JANIJARY 30, 1934
I shall pass through this world but once.
Any good therefore that I can do, or any
kindness that I can show to my fellow
creatures, let me do it now, let me flot defer
or neglect it, for 1 shall fot pass this way
again.
Hon, O0.
TURGEON (Translation): Honourable senators, I should flot intervene in these
magnificent tributes to our brethren whom
death has taken from. us since last session,
for I cannot reach the high level attained
by our bonourable leaders in the expression
of our sentiments with regard to our departed
colleagues and their familles.
But I cannot resist the impulse to, make
known to this generation and to posterity the
qualities and virtues of that great Acadian
patriot, Pascal Poirier, whom I have bad a
better opportunity of appreciating than others
have had, because of our close and intimate
relations extending over a period of about
sixty years.
As is well known tbroughout Canada, our
deceased colleague was endowed witb great
literary talent. From bis early years in St.
'Josepli's College, now the University of St.
Joseph, this talent was recognized and appreciated as a special gift. Great literary and
philosophical institutions ini France seemed
eager to express their appreciation of it by
honouring his literary and philosophical works
with their bighest awards. The French
Academy and the institut de France bastened,
as it were, to study bis works and proclaim
to the world their real value by awarding
them prizes and medals, and the Government
of France appointed him. Chevalier of the
Legion of Honour. His principal works,
"Father Lefebvre and Acadia," "The Origin
of the Acadians," "The Acadians Deported to
Boston in 1755," are certainly of great merit,
and the reading of tbem reveals the pbilosophical as well as literary genius of their author.
Each point of history is accompanied witb
reflections which toucb the heart and arouse
the spirit of the reader.
Senator Poirier was an Acadian by birtb,
and no Acadian loved bis race more than hie;
no one regretted more the persecutions to
wbich bis ancestors were subjected in this
land of America. Yet there bas not been in
Canada, nor even in tbe United Kingdom, a
more sincere admirer of tbe bigb and noble
British ideal of the last two centuries. To
tbis fact I would draw tbe attention of ail
Canada. H1e was a true Acadian and also a
true British-Canadian. H1e proved this in bis
hiBtory of Father cLefebvre. After having
described the situation of the small nunter
'of Acadians remaining in 1767, despoiled of
their goods and their bornes, bie says, on page

81: "But let us draw tbe durtain upon this
most pitiful scene." He had pardoned ail.
"My purpose," said bie in recalling the events
of 1755, "is flot at ahl to evoke the revolting
memories associated witb our disappearance
as a people, and stili Iess to arouse feelings
of animosity towards our oppressors of those
times. In spite of aIl, tbe Acadian race bas
preserved its religion and its faith." Then
hle continues: "Mr. Edouard Richard baa
proved tbat the Acadian deportation and the
despoiling of the Acadians were done witbout
the consent of the British Cabinet, and were
tbe personal work of the governors of Halifax
and their greedy bencbmen. It is better tbat
this is so," hie adds, "and that we can witbout
bitterness turn our eyes towards that august
Crown under wbicb we live."
His devotion to tbe Britisb ideal I would
recail as one of bis great qualities. Lt was
bis constant desire to bave that ideal better
known not only by bis compatriots, but also
by the entire English-speaking population, by
statesmen, and by the Sovereign.
Lt w'as witb this object, it was to arouse
the spirit of tbe Acadian race, that bie undertook in 1915 to bave an Acadian name placeci
on the list of bonorary titles conferred by
His Majesty the King-the name of Judge
Pierre A. Landry, of New Brunswick, wbo,
had devoted bis life to the advancement of
the Acadian race; a junist of great distinction,
wbose judgments still stand as precedents in
the New Brunswick courts of justice. Senator
Poirier had accomplished this task, but I bad
known notbling of it. One day I met bim
and bie said: "Everytbing is arranged for the
conlierring on Judge Landry of the title 'Sir';
but Sir Robert Borden would like to bave
also your request, so that the petition to His
Mai esty may come fromn both political
parties." "Certainly," I replied at once. Sir
Robert Borden received me with bis gracious
smile and I added my signature to that of
Pascal Poirier. Everytbing was indeed arranged. Three weeks later Judge Landry
received bis title, "Knight Grand Cross of the
Order of St. Michael and St. George."
With all his other good qualities Senator
Poirier bad a generous beart. H1e was a Conservative, grateful to Sir John Macdonald and
Senator Jobn Costigan, W~ho, in perfect accord,
had bad birn appointed to the Senate at an
early age. But bie was flot dominated by
party spirit. lie became also a great admirer
and friend of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who generously reciprocated bis friendsbip and esteem.
On tbe 15th of February last, bis birtbday,
I went to visit Senator Poirier in bis room,
close to mine, and to wisb bim many more

many years to corne-at least until lie had

irrevocable.
Pascal Poirier is dcad. His loss is dcplored,

GENERAL'S SPEECH
IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Gevernor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. HORATIO C. HOCKEN rose to inove
that an Address be presenbed toHis Excellency
the ýGovornor Goneral to off er the humble
thanks of this House to His Excellency foi'
the gracious Speech wbich he bas been pleased
to make te boîtb Houses of Parliament.
Ho said: Honourable senators, the horizon
is growing 'brighter as the weeks and the
months pass. Therefore, I take it, tbe accura.cy of His Excellency's staternents regarding the improvernent in conditions througbout
the Dominion cannot be qucstioned.
We are slowly ernerging frorn an unparallcled depression, and I arn unable to find
words adequately to express rny admiration
for the conduet of the Canadian people during this difficult period. Witb reduced incornes, they bave succoured relatives, friends,
and even stranzers whose need was greater
than their own. It is impossible to form an
estimate of tbe extent of private benevolence,
which bas donc so rnuch to alleviato the distress ocoa.sioncd by the enforced idleness of
so large a proportion of our population. But
it is known to the most casual observer that
there bas been a generous sharing of meagle
re5ýourccs w'ith those wbo otberwise would
bave gone cold and hungry. In their private
lives Canadians have shown a degree of consideration for the needy that is beyond the
power of language to express. It must be
plain to ail tboughtful observers -that in their
public capacity-tbrough the various forms of
govcrnment-our citizens have glaffly sanetioned expenditures of publie monoy for purposes of relief to the very limit of their taxpaying power. The federal and provincial
governrnents and the municipal councils have
appropriated enormous sums to provide the
Hion. Mr. TURGEON.

necessities of life for hundreds of thousands
who without such aid would have suffered
scverely frorn want of food, clothing and fuel.
It may fairly be said, therefore, that in their
private and public capacitios the people of
our Dominion have met the iînprecedented
demands made upon themn with a dogrec of
gcncrosity and sacrifice that is bigbly croditable to their sonse of responsibility for the
welfaro of their bass fortunate follow-citizens.
In my opinion a trihute of respect and
admiration is due to those wbo bave boon
unornployed througb this long, sorrowful
period. Thoy bave resistcd the appeals of
rovolutionaries wbo bave urged them to take
violent measuros, moasures that W~ould wreck
our institutions, in the vain hope of improving thoir social condition. Only those who
have faced se, black a future are able to appreciate the force of the temptations prcscnted
to tbemn to dostroy our social systom, and to
understand the full measure of restraint that
thcy have imposed upon themselvcs to maintain poace and order.
In rccognizing what a,11classes have donc to
win througli these bard tirnes, lot us not overlook the patience and fortitude displayed by
those who bave, througb no fault of their
own, been deprivod of opportunities to provide for themnsclves and their families. All
bonour to the mon and wornen wbo have faced
the humiliation of accepting relief, and witb
bigh courage patiently await the end of their
trials.
That time seerna to be drawing nigli. Conditions of labour are se much botter that there
is reason to hope we are on the way to complote recovery of industry, and a stato of
reasonable prospcrity for ail our people. This
is being accomplished in Canada witbout the
adoption of sucb adventurous policies as arc
being triod elsewbcre. There is ne plan that
can restore prospcrity overnight. Prosperity
cannot ho irnprovised. Slow, perbaps, but
steady omergonco fromn our valley of diffieulty
offers the best hope for the future comfort
and happiness of the Canadian people.
The policy of Empire Preference adopted at
the Ottawa Conference bas donc mucb to irnprove conditions in this country. But it bas
done more: it bas brougbt us into dloser toucb
witb our fellow members of the Imperial
family. And it bas donc even more: it bas
given the world a new idea. We are familiar
with the policies cf froe trade and protection;
at Ottawa was evolved the policy of reciprecal
trade-of the self-governing Dominions trading one witb another, on fair terrns te each,
fer the advantage cf ahl.

JANUARY 30, 1934
It seems to me, honourable senators, that
as we recover from our present situation we
should resolve that never again, if it is within
our power to prevent it, shall this Dominion
be plunged into an industrial morass such as
that from which we are now slowly extricating ourselves. There must surely be a way
to prevent these recurring periods of depression, fraught with such grave danger to
the stability of our institutions. Various plans
are suggested-and elsewhere adopted-to
create a new social order more equitable for
Communism is
the mass of our citizens.
offered as a form of government superior to
democracy as we have it throughout the British Empire. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a form of tyranny from which all
freedom-loving Canadians revolt. Fascism is
also offered as another cure-all for our social
ills. This is pure autocracy, a return to the
administrative principles of the Middle Ages.
It took a thousand years of struggle to develop
our democratic institutions, assuring personal
liberty to the humblest citizen of the realm.
Is the fruit of ten centuries of effort for human
advancement to be discarded in favour of a
reversion to the autocracy of the Middle
Ages? Therefore I have no sympathy for
Communism or Fascism. I believe our present democratic system, so slowly evolved, is
best; but it is not perfect. In my opinion,
however, it is capable of adjustments which
are necessary in the interest of the whole
people. Unless some regulations are made to
preserve our present system, the existence of
our free institutions will be threatened, if not
destroyed, when the next period of depression
arrives. A brief glance at the reforms that
have taken place since the beginning of the
industrial era in Great Britain should give us
confidence in our ability to carry them still
further, until conditions for all our people
have become much better than they now are.
A revolutionary spirit has taken possession
of the people all over the world. While Canada has been infected by this destructive
virus less than other countries, there have been
disturbing manifestations of it in the Dominion. Men holding responsible positions have
boldly advocated the nationalization of industry, which to me has the aspect of pure Communism. To adopt such a policy would be to
rob the Canadian people of the priceless
possessions of individual initiative and personal liberty. Under our democratie system
the most humbly born citizen can hopefully
aspire to the highest places of leadership in
industry, finance, politics, law or any of the
other professions. The way is open to any
young man or woman who is industrious,
ambitious, and reasonably endowed with

il

intelligence and integrity. This advantage
would be lost by the nationalization of industry, finance, medicine, and the other professions, which some advocate so glibly as "a
new social order." Our youth would become
mere numbers on the records of a bureau,
with little or no prospect of advancement.
Let it be assumed (which I do not admit)
that the general level of*subsistence would be
raised somewhat: that in my -opinion would
not compensate for the oss of liberty and
initiative that would result.
As to other forms of administration under
dictators, the idea is repugnant to the democratie spirit. Above everything else we must
preserve our liberties in every field of human
activity, and have free scope for the development of the talents of all our people for the
personal and communal welfare.
I note with satisfaction, honourable senators,
that a monetary expert has been appointed to
advise the Treasury department. His study
of our financial situation should produce
highly valuable results. And I think that the
establishment of a Central Bank is a step in
that direction which will meet with popular
favour. But in my opinion that is not enough.
I believe that an attempt should be made to
reconstruct not merely our monetary system,
but also our industrial system. If we are to
have monetary experts, why should we not
have industrial experts who would sit down
patiently and study, not for a brief period,
but from year to year, what improvements
could be made with respect to unsatisfactory
industrial conditions, and report to Parliament from time to time their recommendations for new fundamental laws?
I am firmly of the opinion that while our
democratic methods are the best, there are
modifications and readjustments to be made
in our economie scheme that will inure to the
advantage of all classes. There must surely
be some way of harmonizing the interests of
both capital and labour, and putting an end
to the age-long industrial warfare that has
been so injurious to both sides and so disastrous to the whole country. The labourer
who works with his hands is worthy of his
hire, and the man who works successfully
with his brain is worthy of his reward. I
am a friend of labour and of capital, but my
rôle at the present time is principally that of
an observant citizen, watching the progress of
events and trying to see if there is not some
way of improving conditions on one side and
the other so as to put an end to the strife
that has existed for so long. The objective
should be to give to the labourer a wage
sufficient to provide the basic comforts of
life for himself and his family, together with

SENATE
assurance of steady employment or subsistenco, and to the brain worker rewards
proportionate to the service lie is able to
render for the promotion of the general welfare.
I do ot tbink this can be accomplished
at one stroke. P.resent-day conditions zepresent a long evolutionary process, extonding
over gonerations. We should adhere to that
process, but accelerate it se that in a coinparatively brief period of yoars we should
reacb a point which, without intelligent planning, mighit take several generations. As I
see it, whatever regulations appear to be
wise and necessary should be put into effeet
piece by piece, -as rapidly as possible. While
I have my own idea of what should be done,
I arn not 50 presumptuous as to attempt to
offer a formula to bring about the changes

of the honour which has been conferred upon

deliberations the firmest convictions, a profound respect for our history, absolute confid-ence in the established order of thinigs, and
in the letter and spirit of our Constitution,
an ardent faith in the great destiny of Canada.

JANUARY 30, 1934
What will the year 1934 bring forth? Mankind has begun it with a feeling of optimism
and of manifest confidence, yet mingled with
grave apprehension. The ruins left by the
Great War still encumber, here and there,
the surface of the earth, and momentous
problems remain to be solved.
After the period of rejoicing which marked
the end of the sanguinary nightmare, the
peoples of the world began feverishly to search
for a field of action. I have a very clear recollection of the enthusiasm with which the Imperial Conference of 1921 completed its labours. Production, work, peace efforts, such
were the noble and reassuring appeals that
resounded beneath the historie vaults of Westminster, to be broadcast throughout the world.
That was practically the inception of the
period of feverish activity, somewhat hesitant
at first, but soon attaining a giddy pace. Work
for all and mass production were to restore
order, harmony and prosperity, banish for ever
the causes of world friction, and usher in an
era of new liberty for all peoples.
But a cloud still hung on the horizon, in
that sky illumined with the fires of the new
ideal. The source of the storms had not dried
up. Full effect had not yet been given to
that resolute and disinterested attempt to
complete the restoration of the mass of ruins
left us by that period which had just ended
in bloodshed. The world had entered upon
the path of unlimited production and the
acquisition of wealth without having attempted to reorganize its governmental system or restore to political authority the prestige necessary for its effectiveness.
Our neighbours, favoured in more than one
respect, the creditors of the universe, soon set
themselves up as masters of the economic
world, dictating the new law. Intensity of
production, they urged, increases in salary,
shortening of the hours of labour, facilities
for the consumer, co-operation on a vast scale,
must assure permanent prosperity. The first
results were staggering, and the world was so
convinced that it thought itself at the gates
of the Promised Land. A famous economist,
in a much heralded book, even asked, "Who
will be the master, Europe or America?"
The inevitable happened to us: our resistance yielded to the constant fascination exercised upon us by our neighbours. Following
their example, we embarked upon vast enterprises, breaking with our traditions of moderation and spending without counting the cost.
Under the pretext of the rapid development
of our natural resources we called upon our
neighbours to aid us with their capital, and
granted them large portions of our public
domain, thus giving them the opportunity

13

which they had long sought of gaining a foothold on Canadian soil. And notwithstanding
our endeavour to increase production, and our
need to negotiate for new outlets in order to
maintain it at the higher level, we placed ourselves in such a position that we were buying
more from them than we could sell to them.
Our blind faith in the new gospel caused
us to fall into the evil that wrought such havoc
during the decade following the War: overexcitement and heedlessness. We did not stop
to ask ourselves whether the magnitude of our
enterprises was commensurate with the number and the real needs of our people, or
whether they were not drawing imprudently
upon our public and private capital and overburdening the future for an indefinite period.
Such was our miscalculation in the economic
field.
Have we been more farseeing from the
strictly national point of view? One of the
greatest statesmen has written that for the
wise development of a country it is necessary
to remind it unceasingly of the principles of
its origin. I could not help feeling that in the
throng, deeply impressed rather than curious,
that surged outside and within these walls,
following with interest the display of historic
pomp and ceremony in the midst of which the
sovereign authority came once more to entrust
to the representatives of the people the duty
of exercisng their powers and giving effect to
their wishes-I could not help feeling that in
that throng vibrated the proud and lofty soul
of Canada. I know well that we all, steadfast
guardians of the Constitution and the rights
of the people, love Canada in its distant past
and in the present day; that we believe in its
future greatness through its unity. But is it
not necessary to remind the rising generations,
as they move farther and farther from the
sources of our national life, or to remind those
who are eager for the return of great prosperity, that the fundamental idea of the
Fathers of Confederation in guaranteeing to
preserve intact the traditions of the two great
races was to band the provinces of Canada
together in an indissoluble whole, for the purpose of creating in the north of this continent
an essentially Canadian mode of life? They
desired, therefore, to endow Canada with a
government system both flexible and firm,
which should give full scope to all legitimate
ambitions. To insure harmony between the
races and contentment among the people was,
they believed, to insure at the same time
national unity and to avert the American
peril.
Can we give to national unity its full meaning in the midst of the conflict of interests
and tendencies? Its apparent fragility should
be the strongest incentive of our actions.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Hocken for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, it is my pleasant duty
to welcome to this Chamber not only the
mover and the seconder of the Address, but
all who were sworn as members of the Senate
last week. I hope that they will be long
with us and that we shall enjoy their company. To the mover and the seconder I can
only say that they will soon realize-indeed,
they must already have realized-that in this
Chamber, as in the other, the East and the
West meet, and that all sentiments, opinions
and convictions, however deeply at variance
they may be elsewhere, tend to be brought
into harmony here.
The mover of the Address (Hon. Mr.
Hocken) reminds me of what he stands for,
and of the many differences and clashes in
olden times between the provinces of Ontario
and Quebec. How often have I not heard of
the Orange Sentinel during the last fifty
years! I recall the long mastery of Sir John

15

A. Macdonald in the federal arena, and his
admirable strategy as he managed to retain
the support of the Orange lodges in Ontario
and the Ultramontane party in Quebec. Both
had representatives in his Cabinet. The
Catholie clergy had been frightened by the
radical programme of 1854, in which was to be
found, among many advanced ideas which
have mostly been incorporated since in our
statutes, the abolition of the tithe system.
They did not foresee that they themselves
would gradually abolish it by mutual agreement in the province of Quebec. I have often
heard the tithe system in Quebec disparaged
by people who did not know that it existed
in Great Britain. The Catholic clergy apparently were less afraid of the enemy afar, the
Orange Order, than of the enemy at home,
the radical wing of the Liberal party.
We enjoyed in this House the company of
Sir John A. Macdonald's Orange colleague,
Sir Mackenzie Bowell, a Past Grand Master
of the Orange Order, whom I used to call my
Catholie leader, because of his Remedial Bill.
I do not despair of one day bestowing the
same title and blessing upon the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hocken),
for I am well aware of the rapidity with which
we all mellow in the atmosphere of this
Chamber. In these troublous times we are
in search of light and are looking for betterment of present conditions. The honourable
senator in his address has presented ideas of
a constructive nature.
The seconder of the Address (Hon. Mr.
Fauteux) has for a long time had my
sympathy, because for many years he had to
battle with the persistent waves of Liberalism
in Quebec. But he possesses talents, courage
and tenacity, and so he never faltered in the
uphill fight he was waging. His record bespeaks his possession of strong convictions
and character, and his appointment is a
valuable acquisition to this Chamber.
I need not tell honourable members that
economies are still engaging the attention of
all thinking people throughout the world.
But I am convinced that there is a graver
problem than economics dominating world
affairs just now, and perhaps affecting the
economic situation to a large extent: I refer
to the war cloud which overhangs Europe.
Many writers and other students of world
conditions say that we cannot return to
normalcy until the threat of war is removed.
I was happy to read just a few days before
this session was convened the joint message
in support of the League of Nations signed
by the Right Hon. Mr. Bennett, the Right
Hon. Mr. Ring and Mr. Woodsworth. In that

16

SENATE

document I read the thought which I have
just mentioned:
Without doubt world peace is menaced
to-day as at no tinte since the close of the
Great War.
This is the opinion of the present situation
held by the three gentlemen who represent
very many of our people.
The great concern of those who are interested in re-establishing normal conditions in
Europe has been the paralysis of the Disarmament Conference and the withdrawal of
Germany from that Conference. Why has
Germany withdrawn? I have never hesitated
to express the opinion that that country had
withdrawn because the plan agreed upon by
Great Britain, France and Italy was distasteful to ber. The plan contained a principle
which Germany would not accept-control.
Germany shuns control because she wants a
revision, if not complete abandonment, of
the Treaty of Versailles, and she wants te
retain the right to manoeuvre in such a way
as to reach that goal by any means. It is
natural that sie should constantly strive to
have the treaty revised, but it is quite alarming to think that she will not consent te
armament control.
I was much pleased to find that the President of the United States, in his address at a
meeting of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation
on the 28th of December last, supported the
views of Great Britain, France and Italy in
favour of armament control. This means control of the armament, not of Germany alene,
but of all the nations of Europe. Mr. Roosevelt said:
Let every nation agree to eliminate over a
short period of years, by progressive steps,
every weapon of offence in its possession, and
to create no additional weapons of offence.
This does not guarantee a nation against
invasion unless you implement it with the right
to fortify its own border with permanent and
non-mobile defences; and also with the right to
assure itself through international continuing
inspection that the neighbours are not creating
nor maintaining offensive weapons of war.
This is the kernel of the whole policy which
Sir John Simon was about to propound at
the meeting of the Disarmament Conference
when Germany withdrew.
If I nay make bold te cite myself, I may
say that two years ago, in this Chamber, I
propounded a plan of general armament control over Europe. It will be found in Senate
Hansard of February 8, 1932. From it I
extract but one paragraph:
If all the nations of Europe are acting in
good faith, why should not the Couneil of the
League be given the power to inspect and
control not only 50 kilometres of German
teriitory, but the territory of every country
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

on that continent? And, indeed, why should
not that principle be extended to the whole
world? If the countries have nothing to hide,
why

should they not open

such an inspection?

their frontiers to

I have felt that there could be no peace in
Europe, that no one on that continent could
sleep at ease, until some plan was devised by
which each nation would know what was taking place on the other side of its frontier. The
press and other publications did me the honour
to reprint this speech in Geneva. There I
found that the representatives of some of the
member-nations did not take readily te the
plan, but they have since adopted it.
However, no headway can be made in that
direction, owing to Germany's refusal of yesterday and, I am1 quite sure, to-morrow, te
accept the principle of control. In my opinion,
a very simple solution of the difficulty would
be the adhesion of the United States to the
League of Nations. When the United States
joined the Allies she proclaimed that she was
waging war te end war; but she left her task
unfinished.
Having represented Canada at
the League of Nations for a period of seven
years, I deemed it my duty in January last
to inform the President-elect, Mr. Roosevelt,
of the situation at Geneva. I was received by
him with great cordiality. I advised him that
the League was often handicapped and at
times helpless because of the absence of the
United States from its councils, and that since
the War Europe had been floundering through
lack of leadership which the United States
alone could furnish. The distracted peoples
of Europe do net ask the United States te
guarantee their security, but they do need
her presence at the League, because of the
moral influence which this would exert.
As we all know, the United States Senate
was ready te sanction membership of the
country in the League, with seme reservations. President Woodrow Wilson refused
to accept those reservations.
Of course,
one is always wiser after the event, but
I venture to say that te should have
accepted them. The League, I am sure, would
have welcomed the United States te its councils on that basis. The present chaotie conditions in Europe are due to the absence of
the United States from the deliberations of
the League. True, by a separate treaty with
Germany in August, 1921, the United States
declared definitely that she was net assuming any obligation te preserve the boundaries
of Germany. But Woodrow Wilson's fourteen points were generally acclaimed in the
United States, and the thirteenth point covered the restoration of Poland, with access te
the sea. That meant the Polish Corridor,

JANUARY 31, 1934
and when in August, 1921, the United States
signed that treaty the Corridor was already
in existence. No protest ever appeared from
any quarter, high or low, in the United States,
against the restoration of Poland or against
the Polish Corridor. I see in the situation
which exists between Poland and Germany
a manifest moral responsibility on the part
of the United States. The Corridor had been,
is, and will be the crucial point in Europe
in spite of any treaties that may be signed
in the future.
President Roosevelt's answer appears in his
address to the Woodrow Wilson Foundation,
which I am sure most of my honourable colleagues have read. He stopped short of full
co-operation. After criticizing the negotiators
of the Versailles Treaty for their ambitious
spirit and claims, be said:
Nevertheless, through the League directly, or
through its guiding motives indirectly, the
states of the world have groped forward to
find something better than the old way of
composing their differences.
The League bas provided a machinery which
serves for international discussion, and in very
many practical instances it has helped labour
and health and commerce and education, and
last but not least, the actual settlement of
many disputes, great and small, among nations
great and small.
To-day the United States is co-operating more
openly in the fuller utilization of the League of
Nations machinery than ever before.
I believe that I express the views of my
countrymen when I state that the old policies,
alliances, combinations and balances of power
have proved themselves inadequate for the
preservation of world peace.
The League of Nations, encouraging as it
does the extension of non-aggression pacts, of
reduction of armament agreements, is a prop
in the world peace structure.
We are not members and we do not contemplate membership. We are giving co-operation to the League in every matter which is
not primarily political, and in every matter
which obviously represents the views and the
good of the peoples of the world, as distinguished from the views and the good of political
leaders, of privileged classes or of imperialistic
alms.
Mr. Roosevelt recognizes the importance of
the League and its usefulness in very many
fields, especially in the maintenance of peace,
but be goes no further than to give it his
blessing from afar. Perhaps be is restrained.
I have no doubt that he is restrained by an
uninformed public opinion not as far advanced
as his own view or that of the élite of the
two great parties in the United States, respecting full co-operation.
Another war in Europe would cause the
United States a rude and cruel awakening. I
believe that the world is now too small for
any country, the United States or any other,
to adopt a position of splendid isolation. No

nation, much less a great nation, can ask the
world, "Am I my brother's keeper?" Great
Britain and France need nothing but peace.
Great Britain with the co-operation of the
United States can insure the peace of Europe.
Will not our great neighbour to the south go
one step further and throw its mighty influence into the balance to help save our threatened civilization?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Speech
from the Throne outlines a number of problems to come before us for discussion during
the present session, most of them arising out
of the crisis which it is admitted on all sides
still exists; and some suggestions are made
towards ending that crisis.
There has been an improvement in some
directions; we notice signs of it in the reports
that come to us from large institutions. There
is a ray of hope. We seem to have reached
the bottom of the valley and are, we trust,
beginning to ascend. But one aspect of the
situation-and it is alluded to in the Speech
from the Throne-is still quite unsatisfactory.
It is said that the price levels of agricultural
products are too low to ensure the success of
our farmers. This I believe to be the crux
of our problem. Until our farmers are able
to produce profitably I cannot see how their
purchasing power can increase, particularly
when their lot seems to be aggravated by high
tariffs.
- When the value of farm products is low the
cost of living should be low, and if the cost
of living is lowered the price of industrial
products also should be lowered. High tariffs
militate against such an adjustment.
The United States, under the direction of
the new administration, has made an effort
to increase the prices of farm products in
that country; but attention seems to have
been given first to increasing the price of
industrial products by raising wages and
reducing the number of hours of labour, and
while that process was taking place there was
no rise in the prices of agricultural products.
As we have all heard, a million or two
million farmers threatened te rebel because
their products had not risen in value when
the prices of all they had to buy had been
increased.
Canada's special problem is the overproducFor the last four years

economists have been at loggerheads as te the
causes of the crisis. It has been hard to
find two economists who would agree, some
claiming that overproduction was the cause,
others that it was underconsumption. I think

SENATE

thev are now about to be reconciled, and
with a fair degree of unanimity have concluded that we have been suffe'ring front
general overproduction.
Addressing myself to the problema of the
West, 1 flnd that the wheat acreage in the
three Western Provinces in 1913 amounted to
9,895,000 acres; in 1919 to 17,500,000 acres.
In the United States there were 48,000,000
acres under whcat in 1913, and 73,000,000
acres in 1919. Yet there was no increase in
the total acreage of the world, by reason of
the sho-rtage in some of the warring countries.
In spite of the increases in North America,
the world equilibrium was stili maintained
in 1919.
In 1913 France pToduced 32ý1,000,000 bushels
of wheat. The production fell off, of course,
duriag the War, but gradually worked up
again to the same figure in 1921. After that
year Europe forged rapidly ahead, France's
production going up to 338,000,000 bushels in
1933. During the same period the production
of Italy increased from
184,000,000 to
272,000,000 bushels; that of Germany froma
131,000,000 to 192,000,000 bushels; Czechoslovakia's production increased fr-om 38,000,000
to 66,000,000 bushels, and Sweden's froým
8,000,000 to 29,000,000 bushels.
In those
countries alone there was an increase in 1933
of 215,000.000 bushels. And as they increased
their production they were raising their tariffs.
While Europe ivas becoming seif-sufficient,
what wvas the situation in regard to our own
wheat acreage between 1919 and 19,33? In
1919 our acreage amounted to 17,500,000
acres; in 1926, to 21,800,000 acres; in 1928, to
23,159,000 acres; in 1932, to 26,395,000 acres.
In 1933 there was a small deecline to 25,177,000
acres.
Our carry-over in 1926 amounted to
36,000,000 bushels; in 1929 to 104,000,000
bushels; in 1932 to 131,000,000 bushels, and in
1933 to 212,000,000 bushels. The earry-over
of the United States for 1929 amounted to
150.000,000 bushels; for 1930-31 to 200,000,000
bushels, and for 1932 to 360,000,000 bushels.
With such an immense carry-over it is nlot
surprising that prices went down.
Now, what was the situation in the East
before we were faced with mass-production
of wheat in the West? The regulation of
prices in the eastern provinces, t-hat is, Ontario,
Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, was an
individual problem; every farmer made his
own readjustinents, and hais sole guide was the
market.
He carried on diversified farming.
Truc, he had lean years, but during those
years he lived off his farm.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The mass-production of the West presen-ts
a new problem. So far I have heard of no
individual readjustinent in the West-Ilater
on we may hear froin representatives of the
West on this question-and the State has
been called upon to help.
Can it help
indeýfinitely? I doubt it. States in general,
where there bas been mass-production, have
felt that an effort should be made to regulate.
The London Wheat Agreement may offer a
solution, though, I confess, it seems difficult
to al)ply.
The right honourable gentleman
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) may tell us under
what conditions this wheat limitation wiIl take
placc--whether the farmers will be urged to
contract their acreage voluntarily, or will be
allowed a bonus, as is the case in the United
States. In the United States 600,000 farmers
have agreed to co-operate and are reducing
the acreage by 8,000,000. This will represent
a decrease in production of 100,000,000 bushels.
It secins to me that the United States is
moving in the direction of a permanent policy
of control in order to prevent a recurrence of
such a crisis as that through whicha we are
passing. The question to my mind is: Can
control replace the natural law of supply and
demand? The near future will furnish the
answer. If our Canadian farmers are asked
to agree to ýreduce the acreage under erop by
fifteen per cent, they naturally wilI ask the
question, "What shall we produce instead that
is marketable?"'
This is, I recognize, a problem of great
importance to the fariner. I suggest with due
timidity-because I am sure, and I have
beard it said before now, that the West is
tired of taking advice fromn tbe East-that
some part of that fifteen per cent of the
present acreage whicha is to be withdrawn
froin wheat production should be used to
provide for domestie needs.
By putting
questions to members of the Senate from the
West I have been endeavouring to -ascertain
whether, wben there is a failure in the
wheat crop by reason of drought or front
other causes, the Western farmer is self-sustaining and can live off bis farin. We al
know what takes place in the East. Every
farmer grows corn, hay, vegetables, and keeps
a cow or cowvs, hens, sheep and hogs. All I
can do is compare the lots of our Eastern and
Western farmers. 0f course, as I have said,
we have lean years in the East, but I have
yet to learn that during such years the
Eastern farmers have not been able to, produce their three meals a day. I hear of
crop failures in the West, and such news
always strikes me as tragie. It is flot sck
in the East.

JANUARY 31, 1934
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Well, there is

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: There may be a
crop failure in a certain district, but there
neyer bas been a crop failure in the entire
West.
Hon. Mr. DANDURKND: If a failure in
crop prices pute an end, to the purchasing
power of the Western farmers, then, of
course, we in the East ask oursedves how Vhey
live. I should like to be able to feel that
our Western farmers, corne what may, can
always be sure of their three meals daily. It
was to help make such an assurance possible
that a couple of scesions ago wc passed an
Act ern'powering corporations to subseribe for
the securities of another corporation formed
for the purpose of lending moncy to the
farmers so as to enabie thema to devclop
diversified farming. The situation in the
West is to my mmid one of the most enigrossing proble.ms that we have to face, and
the cbief hopes for improvemexit that I can
at present sec are founded on a reduction of
the wheat output, with a view to bringing
about higher pricPs, and also on the beginnung that bas bee-n made towards diversified
farming, which wben carried a littIe farther
will enable the farmers to live off their farmas.
A matter to which we devoted our attention for some time last session was the railway situation. I doubt that it lias imiproved
very much in the meantime. As a resuit of
co-operation the two railways have suceedeil
in reducing some of their expexiditures. I
was somewhat surprised to find that the
Board whosc appointment scemed se urgently
iecessary a yeýar ago was appointeýd only on
the first of this month. On looking into the
economies that have been realized by mutual
agreement betwcen the two companies I
find they have resulted from a reduction in
competitioxi, and I venture to, say that every
saving that will take place in. the future wil
lie brouglit about by the same ineans. Yet
there may stili lie life in the slogan, " Competition ever." I arn not bowing the knee
to that, aithough 1 recogruize that coxupetitien is a remarkablc thing when we cari
afford such a luxury. I think the motor

nan2ely, that of unemployment. The policy
of a return to the land is en excellent one,
but I doubt that wc can successfully transfer
sorne tens of thousands of people from the
towns and cities to the lanid. A large nuniher
of those people have grown uýp in the towns
and cities and have been artisans ail tbeir
lives. W'hen I think of t-hem -and of the
inevitabiy slow process of. reabsorbing into
industry those who are now unemployed, 1
feel more and more eonvixiced that if our
capitalistie system. is to survive we shahl have
to cstaiblish. a eonitributery unemployment insuranoe system. to tide our people over pe.rioe
of ecùnomie depreSsion. I say that it is the
duty of the thinking people of this country,
of alI' those interested in industry and in other
urban activities, to try te find a way to,
establish, with the co-operation of the provincial and federal goveraments, a contributory unemploymexit insurance scheme, in
erder that the prescrit capitalistie Eystema
under which we live may be continued. For
no system, however strong and solid i-t may
be, can permaaently endure if a large portion
of the population is unable to miake a living
under it.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEýIGHEN: Honourable senators, it is because of iong-tried

effectiveness of the League, therefore, for the
main objects of its existence is very seriously
impaired. It can still carry on its subsidiary
objects, though not so well as it could have
done but for this impeirment, but its great
central and fundamental purpose it cannot
fulfil and bas failed to fulfil in serious crises
in very recent times. We have not muc
difficulty in placing the responsibility for this
failure, but that does not alter the result. I
fear it must be admitted that the condition
of the nations and the repose and security of
humanity on this planet are improved very
little, if any, as compared with what they were
before the War.
Nor bas anytbing happened to make us
much more confident of the results of international conference as a means of establishing
a better situation, a stronger foundation for
peace, or even a stronger foundation for
material prosperity than at present exists. Conference bas followed conference, but the angles
of viewpoint of the nations are different, distrust is rampant, suspicion grows wiith the
years, and all these conditions are accentuated
by certain disparities, inequalities and injustices in the Treaty of Versailles; se much
so that one can understand the growing disposition of nations to seek first to remedy
troubles at home, to try to establish some better
status of society within their own domains,
and then Lope for the best. Such is the attitude of the United States, after the
monumental failure, and that country perhaps
iore than any other is zealously adjusting
ilself to the task of trying to build up a new
economy and greater happiness within its own
boundaries.
The honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) emphasizes the nocessity for higher
farm prices in Canada and deplores the prosent
condition of the Canadian farmer. No one
can pretend te be satisfied with the condition
of agriculture in this country or in any
country; likewise no one can pretend to be
satisfied with the condition of the artisan and
the unskilled worker; least of all can anyone
be satisfied with the lot of those people
throughout the industrial world, whose numbers aggregate not less than thirty millions,
who stand beside the idle machines of the
universe and are unable to find any work at
all. It is indeed a most inexplicable situation
in which the world finds itself. I am not one

worse. On the contrary, I am confident that
they are improving. I am further confident
that here in Canada we have advanced probably more than any other country, with the
possible exception of England. In comparison
vith other lands we cannot complain, but
relative to where we ought to be, in view of
our great basic wealth and our opportunitics, our position is such that all we can do
is hang our heads in shame.
The honourable senator does net compare
the prices that the Canadian farmer pays or
receives, wlhen he buys or sells, with those
existing in the country of our chief competitors. Such a comparison would show that the
Canadian is better off. I believe the Canadian
farmer bas been very substantially helped by
the trade agreements of 1932, especially in
relation to tho subject of hogs. Honourable
niembers will recall I discussed this subject
when we were considering the treaty, and I
had very great hopes of the fruits of the
treaty with respect thereto. Canada now has a
tremendous lead in that field, and the Canadian farmer bas reaped and is reaping substantial and gratifying benefits because the
treaty was made. Some nine cents or a little
more is paid tho farmer in this country, as
compared with less than half that just across
the line. While one cannot be satisfied that
tltings are wholly right, one can at least feel
assured that this country bas net been mismanaged, as compared with our great competitor. And what is truc in that field is
truc in others, though to a less extent.
But we have at this hour a surplus of
nany things, if we can call a surplus something that cannot be disposed of at a profit.
I do not know how under existing world
economie conditions we are ever going te
dispose at a profit of the large-scale modern
power production of field and factory. While
I tlink: things are better and are going to
continue to be better for a time-for how
long it is beyond me to predict-and while
I helieve that the surge, now upwards, is a
more or less universal surge wbich even the
mistakes of government cannot thwart or turn
back,nevoertheless he must be a very hopeful
man and possess a special heritage of optimism who can see a solution for the world's
unemployment problem even in the returning prosperity that now surrounds us. The
unemployed of the United States aggregated
net long ago some twelve millions. They are
somewhat fewer to-day, largely because of
governiment enterprises that are being carried
on with borrowed money, construction works
under way that are either undertaken directly
under the Government or financed with money
supplied by the central power. But the naked

JANUARY 31, 1934
and unassailable truth, which only stupidity
can prevent anyone from seeing, is that if the
United States were to be brought back tomorrow to the peak production of 1929, a
production which the world utterly failed to
consume or to purchase, there would remain
in that country nu fewer than six and probably eight millions of unemployed, representing virtually one-quarter of its whole earning
population. What is true there is true in
other lands, but the enigma is greater and
perhaps the lesson ought to be clearer when
one looks upon the situation as a phenomenon
of the United States. That is essentially an
immensely wealthy country, the most selfcontained country in the world. If it were a
planet it would not need to trade with any
other planet in order to multiply the wealth
of man. It produces either all that mankind
needs or effective substitutes therefor, and if
it could devise a plan for putting to work
those millions who are now unemployed it
would be a happy Iand. When we see that
country struggling in the throes of one of
the most terrible depressions that any nation
bas ever had to face, when we set its people
in such desperate straits that even the people
of Old England are prosperous in comparison,
we are forced to think that something further
is needed than mere amendments to tarifs
and the holding of international conferences,
or the trying of other and somewhat archaic
medicines that have been applied to the body
politic in the past.
When a man could make bis living, and a
fairly good living unless nature interposed
with drought or other calamity, though the
only instrument of production was the individual without any assistance from the contrivances which in later years have been brought
to bear, there was employment, with a living for
all; but with the aid of those contrivances and
the power engine behind them, the individual
to-day is as great a factor in production as would
have been certainly not less than a hundred,
probably a thousand, men five hundred years
ago. To-day a man ought to be able to make a
living by reasonable toil and intelligent application of the gifts with which he is endowed
-a living not only for himself but for a dozen,
yes, for over a hundred of his fellow men.
But suoh is the position we are in that many
men are not able to take care of themselves,
and while in the case of a great number of
them this is attributable to their own lack of
application and intelligent toil as compared
with their fellows, nevertheless it is unfortunately the fact, and we have to admit it, that
in respect of many it is not the fault of themselves at all. I have come in contact with
these cases constantly, day in and day out,

hour by hour, and have seen the pitiable
plight of young men of twenty, twenty-five
and thirty years of age, who as yet have never
known the joy of toil, and who walk from
place to place vainly seeking something to do,
the modern counterpart of the poor creature
described by Burns, "seeking from bis brother
man the leave to toil."
This is the problem of the world to-day.
Although in the interval of time that has
been ours on earth we have witnessed more
than any other generation that ever walked
on this planet, I think the next generation
will probably witness something more formidable, more tremendous, and, I hope, something
more fruitful than anything we have seen.
The Speech from the Throne deals with
those subjects of immediate concern to us at
this time, subjects with which we must do
the best we can. Canada can scarcely be the
exemplar nation of the five-score nations which
inhabit this globe. We have conditions peculiar to ourselves. We have to deal with those
conditions, and we seek to do so with the
best means at our disposal. While we do so,
let us look with sympathy on the efforts of
other countries to meet fundamentals and to
overcome larger difficulties, which the ordinary
treatment of the past certainly can never
overcome.
I mysef look with a great deal of sympathy on the efforts of the Government of
the United States to surmount the troubles
which have afflicted that country. I do not
know that it makes much difference whether
I do or not, but I cannot follow their methods
all the way through. I do net believe we
are ever going to borrow ourselves out of
adversity and into prosperity. I do net
bedieve we are ever going to distribute the
plenty of the world by burning it up. I do
not see anything of advantage to the
struggling masses of the world in the tossing
into the ocean of millions of oranges, or the
burning up of a billion pounds of coffee, nor
do I see that we are going to get better by
rejoicing in the fact that we have a poor
cotton crop or a poor wheat crop. But I
do bel'ieve that industry as it is constituted
to-day cannot operate under the oid principle which we thought was eternal-free competition, the better surviving. I do believe
there bas to be a code in industry, and I
think the Government of the United States
is on sound ground when it seeks, with the
sanction of law, to establish codes to supervise competition. While competition is a
sound principle as applied among individuals,
each with his own gifts and his own particular
equipment for earning a living, yet when you

SENATE

apply it to gigantic units of capital taking
the form of machinery, and set them to
compete, you only determine that each and
probably ail shall be destroyed. Without
the supervision of codes of some sort-such,
indeed, as have grown up in all countriesthose industries will not survive; they wil.l

respect I not only hope for success of the
National Recovery Act of the Government of
the United States, but I do think we have
a right to look confidently for that success.
I do believe as welIl that Canada, watching
at close range, cain ýlearn much from the great
experiment which its courageous President is
now, conducting upon the stage of bis country.
As to the hours of labour, it is true you
do not improve
the lot of an
employee by merely cutting down bis hours.
You may give him an easier time, but you
do not help to feed bis family. I understand
that the objective of the Recovery Act is
not ony to give the employee shorter hours
and fewer days, but to maintain and if
possible increase his wage in order that more
of the fruits of his toil may come to himself, and so, as expressed by the President,
enhan.ce the purchasing power of the worker
a.nd distribute the amount of labour that is
left among those who stand ready to toil.
This residual labour is diminishing adl the
time. Whben the machine was merely an
appliance for ielping the individual to do
his work easily, that machine did not displace the individual, it merely rediced his
labour; but when it takes the form of an
automatic monster driven by power it does
not make the worker's job easy, it abolishes
the job altogether. We have now the
spectacle of tremendous appliances operating
for the production of what the world needs,
without a single man at work.
This, of
course, is a rather extreme example, but
towards this end we are moving steadily. We
have been moving in this direction more
rapidly in the last ten years than ever before,
and still more rapidly in the last four years,
because depression always compels the aýpplication of that practice to industry. This is
the goal we are driving towards, and the
world's problern is to take care of those
whose only means of living has been the
work from which they are so displaced.
While I am not sure that this is very
appropriate to the debate,Hon. Mr. CASGRAdN:

serious attacks on the Speech from the
Throne. I do not claim to b-e its parent,

Government is honestly striving to meet
conditions in Canada as best they can be
met, and I think in that effort it is at least
attaining as -nuch success as, if not more
than, is being attained by other governments
in the world.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Well, if nobody is prepared to continue the debate I
suppose I must stop into the breach. Very
often when the debate on the Address was
about to collapse, it has been my lot to start
something. I remember very well the late
Sir James Lougheed used to tell me when
things were quiet, "For God's sake, Casgrain,
start something!" I am taken somewbat by
surprise, for I expected the honourable gentlemen who preceded me would address the
House at greater length, and that I should
have had time to co-ordinate my notes and
shorten my remarks. Once when Pascal bad
to write hurriedly to a correspondent be concluded his letter with this apology: "Pardon
the length of this letter; I liad no time to be
brief." A similar apology may serve my purpose.
As one of the oldest members of this House,
barring my respected leader-and he does not
think I am very obedient to bis rule-I wish
at the outset to congratulate most heartily
those honourable gentlemen who have just
been admitted to this Chamber. Yesterday
I remembered that I had been a member of
this House for thirty-four years. In looking
over some papers I found a very nice letter
that had been written to me by that good
old Conservative member, now sitting in the
House of Commons, who was active there
when many of the present members were
children. I refer to the Honourable R. S.
White-I beg your pardon, he is not yet so
entitled, but he should bave been many years
ago-the member for Mount Royal. Not
wishing to be indiscreat, I took the trouble
to send him a copy of the letter and ask him
if I might read it to the Senate for the benefit
of the new members, for I have tried my
very best to follow the good instructions which
Mr. White then gave me. Honourable gentlemen will please mark the date:
Montreal, January 30, 1900.
My dear Casgrain:Permit me to congratulate you sincerely upon
having gained what may almost be considered
the blue ribbon of Canadian politics.
I read this especially for the edification of
our younger members.
My own view bas always been that a senatorship is one of the grand prizes, and specially

23

JANUARY 31, 1934
so when one wins it before the weight of years
bas destroyed energy and deadened ambition.
The Senate affords a great scope for useful
work in public affairs and possesses this great
advantage that one's independence is not hampered by clamorous constituents and the vacillation of the mob, while the tenure of office
enables one to mature and enlarge his influence
by steady degrees.
I heartily congratulate you on the honour
you have won and trust you will have many
years of life to enjoy it.
Sincerely yours,
R. S. White.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I think we should
all try to discharge our duties according to
those precepts. I may say that when granting
me the permission I sought, Mr. White
added:
I feel very proud that I could write such a
good letter as that, and I feel more proud that
you seem to have followed the instructions I
gave you.
The mover of the Address (Hon. Mr.
Hocken) is an old journalist and a veteran of
the House of Commons, and certainly it was
an easy task for him to undertake. I am sure
that yesterday he did not show us his full
gait, and I hope we shall hear from him very
often. His name is well known in the province of Quebec. The honorable gentleman
who seconded the Address (Hon. Mr. Fauteux)
is also well known in my province. I admire
him sincerely. I do not hesitate to say that
in his first campaign he might really have
carried the county of Two Mountains, but
unfortunately the Supreme Court decided
that his nomination papers were not in order,
and our man, not very popular at that time,
got in by acclamation. The honourable gentleman fought several other election campaigns with great courage at a time when
the Conservative party was not popular in the
province of Quebec. I do not know that it
is now, but certainly it was not popular then.
I consider both honourable gentlemen are
decided acquisitions to this House.
Now, to come to the Speech from the
Throne, my attention is arrested by the
proposal to establish a Central Bank. Why
a Central Bank? I know the right honourable leader of the House is one of the most
astute men in Canada, and when the legislation is brought down I will take my hat off
to him-as I often do-if he can then tell
me one thing a Central Bank can do that
our chartered banks cannot do. I submit that
a Central Bank is not needed. More than
that, I very much doubt the wisdom of
taking such a step at this particular time,
when, as he says, we are in a regular impasse.
You know what Abraham Lincoln used to
say: "Don't swap horses when you are crossing

a stream." We are in the very middle of the
stream to-day, and we do not know whether
we shall reach the other side. Undoubtedly
this is the most inopportune time to establish
a Central Bank. I may say -there is not the
slightest necessity for such a bank, for our
chartered banks have demonstrated their
stability and their worth during the past four
years. We look to the south and find that
more than five thousand of the banks there
failed during the depression. Not one of our
banks has closed its doors. Why? Because
our laws are such that our banks are conduc.ted in accordance with sound banking
Talking about banks, let me

remind you that the province of Manitoba
established a bank. They are a cheerful
people in that Western country. Do you
know what happened when that bank found
itself in difficulty? The farmers of Manitoba
had put up their good money, but the bank
had no liquid assets. It had lent money too
freely on real estate.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, the farmers
would have lost all their savings had it not
been that the Government asked the Bankers' Association-representing those terrible
bankers who will not lend money where
there is no security-to go to the rescue of
the distressed institution. As I say, the bank
lent too much money on real estate.
Hon Mr. McMEANS: This bank did not
lend any money; it only took savings.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then where did the
fourteen millions go? The savings would have
been lost if the Bankers' Association had not

rate, that is the amount that was mentioned
by a man named Taylor, who was leader of
the Opposition at that time. In any event,
the bankers saved the situation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is not the
honourable gentleman aware that the bankers
refused to take the securities of the province
in order to save the situation, and that someone else should get the credit for that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I mentioned that
it was at the instance of the Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN: What does
the honourable gentleman mean by "at the
instance"? What is the effect of it?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It was prepared to
pay the shot if the others didn't pay.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

24

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Think of the difference between a farmer in the wide open
spaces of Alberta, say, and a farmer in the
United States. Perhaps that Alberta farmer,
with his wife, has come from Michigan and
put his savings into a bank in this country.
His wife says to him, "What position should
we be in if we were in Michigan, where we
used to live?" As you know, men who had
money in the banks there could not draw it
out. The banks kept it. I believe Mr.
Roosevelt thought it would be well if those
people got at least what they had deposited
in the banks.
This proposed Central Bank is to have
$5,000,000 capital. It cannot go very far with
that. A few men in Montreal could easily
buy all the stock of the bank if it were going
te be sold to the public. I think I saw that
the leader of the Opposition in another place
wanted the Government to put up the
Ï5,000,000. Well, the Covernment may do it.
If it is wrong, the Government is sure to do it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Look at the radio
situation. We used to get a clean-cut revenue
from the licence fees paid by owners of radio
receiving sets, and everything was going along
nicely; various corporations owned the broadcasting stations, and radio was doing well.
Everybody was satisfied, and there was nobody
to find fault with. But the Government had
to interfere with that.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why interfere with
radio? What happened? Now we no longer
get a revenue from the licence fees, because
that money is all being used up by the Radio
Commission, and in addition we have to put
up more money. That is poor policy.
This bank is going to pay dividends of five
per cent or six per cent, no more. Well, I do
not know how it is going to pay dividends.
They are not guaranteed. There is one thing
out of which money will be made-if it happens. I hope it will not. The right of our
banks to issue money is going to be taken
away from them and only the Central Bank
will have that right. What will be the effect
of that? I know of a large estate in the city
of Montreal which would be affected. In the
will of the testator it was provided that certain shares of the Bank of Montreal should
never b sold. Now, in view of the fact that
the Bank of Montreal will no longer be able
to issue notes, a suit is being started in the
courts in order to secure permission to sell
those shares. That is not very encouraging,
is it-starting a lawsuit to break a will?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

The Commission which inquired into the
banking situation was composed of five members. There was Lord Macmillan, a very fine
gentleman. I exchanged some correspondence
with him, in the course of which lie wrote
me a very polite letter of three and a half
pages in his own hand. I have great respect
for him. Then there was another gentleman
who came here from the Old Country. For
the moment I have forgotten bis name. I
went to the court-house in Montreal when
the Commission was meeting, and to me it
was just as plain as the nose on your face
that both those men were set on a Central
Bank. A brother of the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) gave
evidence. He was in favour of an exchange
for money, and thought it necessary to have
a Central Bank. I am told by good bankers,
the biggest of them, that an exchange in
Montreal would have no more chance of
regulating the price of money than the Wheat
Pool had when it defied creation and tried
to swing the wheat prices of the world, although it controlled only five per cent of
the world's production. The excuse given for
the establishment of the Central Bank is that
we are under the domination of New York.
It is said that exchange is made, not in Montreal or in Canada, but in London or New
York. There are bank directors listening to
me now, and if I am wrong they can contradict me when I say that you can get all the
exchange you want, and that the excuse given
is a very poor one.
Honourable gentlemen may not be aware
of the fact that if the right of issuing money
is taken away from our banks half of their
branches throughout the country, including
the Northwest, will be closed, because the
banks will not be able to supply those
branches with the necessary money to carry
on. I leave it to you, honourable gentlemen,
what will happen if the branch bank in every
second village is closed, and whether the
people will bless or curse Mr. Brownlee, the
fifth member of the Commission, who gave
the casting vote. To cash a cheque those
people will have to travel to the next village,
or perhaps farther. If the banks lose the
power to issue notesHon. Mr. McMEANS:
To what extent
will it affect their profits?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
I am not a
banker, and therefore am unable to tell the
honourable gentleman. I would if I could,
but I cannot. The farmers instead of being
better off will be worse off; they will have
only half the number of banks that they used
to have. The farmers may think it will be

JANUARY 31, 1934
a Utopia, that it will be an easy matter to
borrow money from the Central Bank, and
that they can borrow it for as long as they
like; but this Central Bank, unfortunately,
will not be a commercial bank.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS. The banks do not
lend any money now.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They have lent
enougi.
Hon. Mr. POPE: The farmers cannot get
any money anyhow; so what is the use of
talking about that?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This bank is supposed to handle Dominion, and perhaps provincial, finances. Any of the banks would be
very glad to handle the Dominion financesthe Bank of Montreal, the Royal Bank, the
Bank of Commerce, or the Bank of Nova
Scotia. There would be no trouble about
that.
Then this bank is to have complete control
of the gold reserve. I do not know what
that means, but I suppose it means something.
The Commission of inquiry was composed of
five members. There were Lord Macmillan
and Sir Charles Addis, strangers to Canadian
business. who favoured a Central Bank. Each
of them was, as they say in Italian, a straniero.
For an Italian to call a man by that name
is the worst insult that he can offer him.
In addition to these two there was Sir
Thomas White. He is a gentleman of parts,
a wonderful man. He graduated from the
university and became a lawyer; after that
he was chief of the assessors of the city of
Toronto, and later became General Manager
of the National Trust Company. Prior to
1911 he had always been a Liberal. Then,
in the famous election of that year, Sir
Robert Borden, in forming his Government,
looked all over this country for a man whom
he could trust with the country's money.
He looked in the Maritime Provinces, and
found nobody.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then he came to
Quebec, and there was nothing doing.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then he went to
Manitoba, and the name of my old friend
Bob Rogers was suggested, but Sir Robert
said, "Oh, no, he won't do at all."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: So he went on to
Saskatchewan and Alberta, and over the
mountains to British Columbia, and not a

25

single Conservative could be found who was
thought fit for the job. Then Mr. FlemingI think he was an uncle of Sir Thomas-said:
"We have a smarit young man here in Toronto.
He is not on the right side of politics, but,
he will turn.'
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is true. And
Sir Thomas White came into the House, and
he was quite a success, and a fine man. I
think he is now Vice-President of the Bank
of Commerce. He knows something about
banking and finance, and is very highly
educated. He told me himself that he ha&
talked for hours with Sir Wilfrid Laurier on
literature, fine arts and law.
Another member of the Commission was
Mr. Beaudry Leman, who besides being a
banker is an engineer. He got all his diplomas
as an engineer in Belgium, came here and was
elected mayor of Shawinigan Falls and built
a railroad into the tovn. One day he said,
"I will become a banker," and he became
such a good banker that for two years he
was President of the Canadian Bankers'
Association.
Those two men, Sir Thomas White and
Mr. Beaudry Leman, knew more about banking in Canada than the two strangers who
came here. They were opposed to this
Central Bank. So who had the casting vote?
It was Mr. Brownlee. I do not know Mr.
Brownlee; he may be a great banker, and he
may have a bank deposit for all I know.
However, he had the casting vote.
Some people say that if we have this Central
Bank it will only be the tool of the Bank of
England. I do not know about that. They
say thaît it wiil probably be run by an English
financier-that there is no one in this country
smart enough to run it.
Just here I want to say a word about this
importation of foreign talent. Another Government imported a gentleman by the name
of Palmer te decide whether or not the famous
Montreal terminai, for which $50,000,000 had
been voted, should be built. What happened?
When Mr. Palmer came face to face with Sir
Henry Thornton and saw the size cf him he
never touched one figure; he said, "Your plans
are all right,"-and our money was wasted.
Then they had to get Mr. Palmer to go to
Port Nelson first, and then to Fort Churchill,
to find out which was the better port. If
they had looked in the Senate Hansard for
the past twenty-five years they would have
found out, for I had put on record navigators'
reports and sea captains' reports, showing that
there was a very miserable port at Fort

26

SENATE

Churchill, and no port at all at Port Nelson.
Think of the money that was paid to Mr.
Palmer. Wlen matters of sailing or marine
transportation are being considered seafaring
men should be ceonsulted instead of engineers.
I do not know anything about banking;
I am not a business man; se, with your permission, J will pass on to another subject,
about which I think I kinow more, the St.
Lawrence Waterway. J shall net take up
much of your time on that subject, because I
have spoken on it so often. The now members, however, may net have heard me.
First, a gentleman who seems to know a great
deal about the United States, and who bas a
good many friends in spite of his Romish
affiliations, the Hon. Alfred E. Smith, says
that it will never pay; that no part of it
will ever pay. And mind you, honourable
gentlemen, he made that 'statement on the
31st of October, 1932, just a few d'ays before
an election, at a time when politicians are
very wary and very careful of what they say.
He says that it will be closed up many months
of the year, but that the bonds will be running
on for twelve months in the year. Then be
instances ithe Erie Canal, which was completed
in 1825, one hundred and nine years ago.
It certainly did develop flic State of New
York, especially the northern part of it. But
remember that before the Erie Canal was
built the freiglit frein Buffalo to New York
was $100 a ton, and $3.33 for a bushel of
wheaît. Needlcss to say, not much wheat was
carried to New York at that rate. But tbose
days have gone, and to-day the Erie Canal
is costing plenty of money, according to the
Hon. Alfred E. Smith, who should know the
facts, because he is an ex-Governor of the
State of New York. He said 'that water transportation was now old-fashioned, and he
wanted to know whether the people would like
te go back to the old stage coaches.
Is it riglt to ship freight by a canal during
seven months of the year and leave the railways and their equipment standing idle all
that time? The railways have te pay twelve
months' interest on their bonds every year,
but to save a few dollars some people would
cease to patronize the railways as soon as the
summer comes around.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Will my honourable friend permit me to ask him a question?
Does he know how much of the grain, for
instance, is being carried each year by the
railroads east of Fort William?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes. But I would
take it as a favour if my honourable friend
would let me finish, and then be can ask me
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

all the auestions be likes.
liard enough time now.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE:
only 3 per cent.

I am having a
I might say it is

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I wish the honourable gentleman would net interrupt me. During the first fifty years there were tolls on the
Erie Canal, and of course the canal paid its
way. It did even better, and paid amortization and interest on the cost, from 1825 te
1875. By that time the railways, which had
been constantly improving, were getting a lot
of the business; so it was decided to abolish
the tolls in an attempt to attract freight to
the canal. Well, that plan did not succeed.
There was no economic Santa Claus to pay
the shot then; so the people of New York
had to be taxed to keep an antiquated waterway in operation. The report to Governor
Smith by Frederic Stuart Greene, who was
Superintendent of Public WVorks of the State
of New York, gave seio interesting figures,
and I should like my honourable friend to
listen te them. He said that in 1925 the net
cost to the taxpayers of New York was $10,573,626 yearly. Every ton floated on the
canal cost the State of New York $4.51, while
the cost of shipping the same distance by railroad was $3.70. The State of New York would
have saved money by paying the freight bills
on the railways and celosing up the canal.
Now let us come home. The Welland Canal
cost, according to the figures given to me by
the right honourable leader of the House,
$125,000,000, without interest during construction. It was begun in 1912, and in 1932 it was
finished with a grand deonstration that cost
something too. I have bad an actuary do
some figuring for me and be says the interest
during the twenty years of construction would
have amounted to $50,000,000. Consequently
the cost to this country of the Welland Canal,
with interest during construction, was $175,000,000. At four per cent that is exactly $7,000,000 a year. Now, how many tons have
been going through? The last report we have,
which I think is for 1932, shows that the total
tonnage both up and down was 7,000,000 tons.
That works out at a dollar a ton, or three and
one-third cents for each bushel of wheat.
It is strange that people will net understand things like that. The old Welland
Canal was worked to only one-third of its
capacity. That meant that all the business
it did could have been handled in two and
a half months of each year. However, that
would not do. We had to discard it and
build one nine times larger. Wbat would
honourable members think of the owner of a
warehouse, say in Montreal, who had use for

JANUARY 31, 1934
only one-third of it, yet pulled it down and
built one nine times bigger? Would his wife
and children not be entitled to go to a court
and ask to have him declared insane? Well,
that is the kind of thing both our parties have
been doing when in power.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the honourable gentleman allow me to ask him a question? How much would the Welland Canal
have carried if instead of being fourteen feet
deep it had been completely obsolete with a
depth of, say, eight, nine or ten feet? Would
it have had any traffie at all?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am very glad my
honourable friend has brought that up. The
Germans are great engineers, and if you go
to Germany you will find that their big canals
are about five or six feet deep, with locks
a thousand feet long, and on their barges of
shallow draft they manage to carry a large
tonnage. I would refer my honourable friend
to the speech I made on this very subject in
the Senate in 1919. Starting during the War,
in the year 1917, the German people decided
to improve their country by building a
number of canals, and they began twentynine of them that criss-crossed the country.
There are four big rivers there, the Rhine,
the Weser, the Oder and the Elbe. There
are mountains intervening, but the German
enginers built their canals up there, and they
constructed large reservoirs for filling the
locks. At the same time they are using
every drop of water for electrical development purposes. My honourable friend would
be well posted if he read that speech of
mine.
The first estimate of the cost of the
Welland Canal was placed at $30,000,000;
the second one was $50,000,000; and the
actual cost was $175,000,000. That gives some
idea of how costs exceed estimates. It is
often said that the fa.rmers would save from
three to four cents-some people say even as
much as twelve cents-a bushel on the shipment of their grain via the new seaway. Well,
the Canada Steamships Lines, of which I am
the oldest director, carried grain through last
summer for less than three cents, and we had
to take 1.4 cent off that for elevator transfer.
So honourable members can see what was left
for the ships. If this wonderful seaway is
going to do business at all it will take every
ton of freight from the railways. The people
of Canada, through the Canadian National,
own sixty per cent of the railway mileage in
the country; so by building the seaway we
should be abolishing the revenue of our own
railways. Do honourable members think that
would be a wise thing to do?

27

In conclusion, I may say quite definitely
that hitherto I have always been opposed to
this international waterway, but now I must
confess I am somewhat in a quandary. After
reading the almost incredible terms of the
treaty, I asked myself whether I should be
justified in continuing my opposition to it,
seeing that under this treaty Uncle Sam
actually obligates himself to the spending of
hundreds of millions of his good dollars on
works in Canadian territory, in which solely
Canadian labour and materials are to be employed. When the United States spent money
on the construction of the Panama Canal they
took good care to acquire ownership of the
whole territory in which those works were to
be carried on. There is not a word in this
treaty about acquiring any of Canada's territory. There may be a good reason for that.
Uncle Sam may have figured out that Canada
would be reluctant to enter into this bargain
if cession of territory were a condition. Does
he now nurse the idea that if he carries out
American works here with his own money, the
protection of those works may later entitle
him to some kind of jurisdiction about which
nothing need for the moment be said? I
do not know what the explanation is, but I
say frankly that I cannot understand why
Uncle Sam is so ready to shovel dollars by
the hundreds of millions into Canada, as is
now proposed, if he is not planning to hold
possession, in some way, of the works those
dollars will represent. It is all very puzzling,
and it brings to my mind the old saw, "Timeo
Danaos et dona ferentes." I fear the Greeks
when they come bearing gifts.
We hear about Canada's prosperity. Well,
let us look back a bit, over the last fifty
years. The Liberals were in power twentyfive years and the Conservatives for an equal
period. During the Liberal regime there was
great prosperity, with tax reduction and
financial surpluses, but when the Conservatives
were in power there were depressions and
everything seemed to go wrong.
In 1888, forty-six years ago, I was making
the cadastral surveys in the county of Compton, in the townships of Compton, Clifton
and Whitton. These townships are each ten
by ten miles, or one hundred square miles; so
the three of them covered a territory of some
three hundred square miles. That was ten
years after the introduction of the National
Policy, but the farms were deserted and the
people were fleeing from the country. I
witnessed the conditions with my own eyes.
Our cadastral plans had to be accompanied
by a book of reference, and in this book we
were required to give the names of the owners
of properties. Well, I would go to a farm

SENATE
and find boards on the windows, padlocks'on
the (loors, and the place entircly deserted.
On the next farm therc would bc the same
condition, ancd somnetîimes thiat would ho true
of thrce farm 0s running. Wben I did corne to
a fim tliat wvas occupied I would ask where
i
the olher people had gone, and the answer
was, "Thcy have gone to the States." I
vouIld ask, "The family?" "Yes, the whole
family." Tho Grand Trunk used to run excursion trains to take the people from the
Eastern Townships. At that time we had an
empty iNorthwest. and evcrything wvas in a
vory depresscd state.
Well, Laurier came inte power and the
whiole situation changed. The depression
lifted ani we had the golden cra. C.P.R.
stock that had been selling around 32 or 33
wvent up te over 240l, se that a man wvho had
$100,000 wnrth of that stock when the Conservativos wcre in power hecame almost a
millionaire during the Laurier regime. From
1901 te 1911 our population incrcased fromn
five millions odd to soven millions odd, and
the wbiole countr'y wvas hooming.
Thon thero ivas a change. The Borden
Governmcnt came in, a nd was succeced by
the Meighen Governmc nt. Everything went
dlowni andà we hacl ail kinds of had times.
There was even a war thrown in. After
that there wvas anothor change, wvith the Iýing
Govornment in power. ýCondàitions improved
again. Things clid not go 1tp quite se far as
they did under Laurier, but we had ceai prosperity.
If honourahle members want te
check the facts for themnselves tbey can take
a look hack at quetations of C.P.R. stock, the
manometer of Canada's presperity. And
when the Conservatives came in again there
was another drop, net merel-y down a tohoggan slide, hut avec a ski jump-so far clown
that even the C.P.R. is not able te pay
dividends. I do net say that the Government is responsible for that.
When Sir
Wilýfrid Laurier wvas in power people used
te say te him, "Providence bas donc a lot
te help yýou."' Ho would reply: " Well, wby
sheuld I quarrel with Providence?
My
opponents must ho very wicked, since Providence will flot help thern in the same way."
I suppose that during the session we shaîl
near Of thae $60,000,000 boan te the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, which I amn toid bas been
guaranteed. The Canadian Pacifie must be
in dire straits to need such a large boan
guaixanteed by the Government. We have a
saying in French, "Qui endosse paie "--Who
guarantees generally pays. This country bas
had experience of what happons in such
cases.

Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Wben I speak of

JANUARY 31, 1934
was guilty, because there was a big Liberal
majority. In 1017 we had to take up the
whole thing.
But eaough of the railway situa.tion. Let
me turn to this mighty Empire of ours. 1
arn an ardent Imperialist. The British Empire as we know it to-day bas been created
almost during ýmy lifetime. In 1856 wbat was
the population of the Empire? There were
only 23,000,000 people altogether ini England
and Scotland. The white population of this
country, at most, was only about 2,500,000.
IIow many white people were there in Australia and in those two magnificent islands
of New Zealand? In South Africs&, Great
Britain had only the Cape of Good Hope. We
;ail] know what hold she bad of 'India, before
the Mutiny. Yet look at the Empire to-dayl
'South Africa is now a self-governing dominion,
perhaps the ricbest part of God's earth. Since
the War the Empire bas grown by thousands
and thousands of square miles.
Before tbe War two things were worrying
the British Empire. England had abandoned
the two-power naval standard, and the Ger-man navy was being steadily strengthened.
When the War was over where was the German fleet? At eleven o'clock on a certain
morning it was sunk in Scapa Flow. The
German crews had been lef t on board. They
copened the sea, cocks, and every ship went
-clown. If those warships had not been scuttled
England might have had to distri-bute them
among hier Allies. So that source of inquietude
was wiped out. There remained the German
colonies of Tanganyika, comprising 386,000
square miles, bordering on Kenya and Uganda
.- beautiful territory, 4,000 feet above sea-level,
comparable to the fertile plains of the Northwest. Every lhonourable gentleman knows what
lappened to those colonies.
We bave good reason to be thankful for
ihe improved condition of affairs in India.
Lord Willingdon, who had come to us as
Clovernor General after having been the King's
representative in the Bombay presidency, was
instrumental in bringing about this muchdesired improvement. Having lived in India
for several years, he was famîliar with the
Asiatic mentality. While at Rideau Hall hie
was asked about conditions in India, and hie
said 'he was amazed at the Viceroy having
conversations with a man wbo was being held
in gaol, because to the Asiatie niind where
there is power there is no0 discussion. The
minute you discuss questions with a Hindu
lie thinks you are afraid of him, and you lose
ail your authority. The British Government,
knowing Lord Willingdon's peculiar fitness for
the post, again appointed him, this time as
Viceroy of India. To-day we hear nothîng

29

about any political troubles in India. In this
case no news is good news. Lord Willingdon
rcalized this fundaýmental truth, that the
respect of the people can only be obtained
when those in power realize their one and
only duty, namely, that the function of a
government is to goverfi. That is the one
thing that commands flot only the respect,
but the active loyalty of the people.
The most grandiose demonstration of the
splendor of the Empire and of its universal
power was given to the world by the
radio last Christmas Day. London, after baving transmitted its good wisbes for a happy
Yuletide to the provinces, to the snow-covered
moors of Northern Scotland, the balmy shores
of the South of England, and the rugged lands
of Wales, calied old Dublin, and offered its
sincere Christmas greetings, wbich the Irish
Capital heartily reciprocated. Then, foilowîng
the diurnal course of tbe sun, Dublin called
Bermuda, extending to this small but most
interesting- country the warmest good wishes
of Ireland to tb.e people of the coral isies.
Bermuda, after thanking Dublin and returning the Christmas greetings, spoke to Ottawa,
offering ber greetings and saying that though
she was small in area, hier people were as great
as any in their fidelity to our Sovereign. Ottawa
responded, thanking Bermuda for bier good
wishes, and returning thema most cordially.
The ýCanadian -Capital, not oniy in English,
but also, in French, assured the Empire that
this northern dîime was as warm in bier affe-ction for the King as Hamilton itself. Ottawa
then called New Zealand, that earthly paradise. New Zealand calied India, India called
South Africa, and South Africa called back to
London.
These greetings encircled the Empire, an
Empire surpassing ail tbe empires of history,
an Empire greater than the great empires of
Persia, Greere and Rome, the kingdoms of
the Great Charlemagne, the empire of Charles
V of Spain, of which it was first said that the
sun neyer set upon it. And when, last Christmas, ail parts of the British Empire had
greeted each other, then a miracle happened.
Eaoh country of the Empire was called, as it
were, into the royal presence, and to his countless people, in every chime, spoke the King
and Emperor of tbe British Empire. That is
a -thing no king except King Ge-orge V has
ever done. And neyer before did that deep
sense of loyalty and of unity which makes the
Empire wbat it is-that family feeling of each
for ail and ail for each-come home to each
and every one of us as it did when our King
spoke to us in our own homes with ail the
clearness that would prevail in the actual
presence of Ris Majesty. In my home we al

30

SENATE

stood at attention as we listened to the wise
and welcome words of the King, exhorting us
to our duties as Christians and as citizens of
the Empire.
Honourable senators, we are witnessing in
these liard days practical evidence of the
value of our heritage as a part of the British
Empire. But far beyond this in value is the
sense that membership gives of pride and
dignity and purpose, for we know we are a
member of the greatest human family, one
that bas its place-and a high place it isin working out the destiny of mankind.
The King, with that royal modesty which
characterizes His Majesty, finished like a
father who on such a day gives his benediction to all his children: he said, "God bjess
you all!" Then the National Anthem was
heard, and every one who had listened to His
Majesty's last words stood with head reverently bowed, and offered, in silence, a sincere
and fervent prayer to the Almighty: "God
save our King and long may he reign over
us."
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
before I ask the consent of the House to the
adjournment of the debate, I desire to pay
my tribute to the ability of the honourable
gentleman who bas just sat down (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain). I know of no way of taking a
world cruise more comfortably than by listening to my honourable friend. He has a fund
of information which is exceedingly valuable
to this House. I purpose to comment on some
of his statements, but with the consent of
honourable members I should prefer to do so
to-morrow.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Black, the debate

THE GOVERNOR

GENERAL'S

SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Hocken for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I desire to join with the leaders on both sides
of this House, and with others who have taken
part in this debate, in congratulating the
mover and the seconder of the Address. I
also wisli to express my welcome to all the
senators who have recently been appointed to
this Chamber.
With reference to the speech by the bonourable member from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain), as I said yesterday afternoon, it is
always a pleasure to listen to his discourses.
He takes us over a very wide territory, and
if his remarks are not always on the subject
under discussion they are at least exceedingly interesting.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I followed with a good
deal of interest the remarks by the honourable
leader on the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), particularly with reference to the
League of Nations, and for the first time in
my life I am going to say a few words on that
subject. I have always been sympathetie with
the aims of the League. I have listened te
a considerable number of addresses made here
on this question, but I have never felt that
the League as at present constituted was going
to <lo for the world what the enthusiasts of
that organization felt it miglt do. That it
bas done good I have no doubt. For instance,
it lias undoubtedly accomplished something
with respect to the traffic in injurious drugs
and the white slave traffic. The League is a
board of consultation in which the representatives of the nations which stil adhere
to it meet from time to time to exchange
views; but it always did seem to me, and I
feel this more strongly now than ever, that
se long as the League had behind it no concrete force it could do but little in the matter
of preventing wars. Since the Great War
there have been more than twenty separate
and distinct armed conflicts, exclusive of those
that have taken place in China, in which
country there have been almost an equal
number.
There seems to be nothing in the constitution of the League whi-ch can keep nations as
members when it suits their convenience to
drop out. What has happened? Not long
after the League was founded a number of
South American nations resigned as members,
possibly either because they did not want te
pay the yearly dues or because they desired
to be free to keep up their ordinary run of
little fights down there. This latter reason
was not a serious thing, because so far back
as my recollection goes wars have been the

FEBRUARY 1, 1934

31

Then the United States is a self-contained
nation, occupying nearly one-baif of the great
continent of North America. She bas a population of 110 to 125 millions, and within ber
own borders she has resources of almost every
kind that could possibly be required. On one
side the Atlantic and on the other side the
Pacifie separate ber from the embroglios tbat
take place in Europe and in Asia. A league
formed of that country, with ber great
financial and numerical strengtb, and the
British Empire, would be able to ensure the
maintenance of world peace. The combined
air, sea and land forces would be so powerful
that such a league would be able to say to
the world, "If any country starts a war wbicb
it cannot justify, we will interfere and see
to it that such country shall suifer." In such
circumstanoes we sbould have a safeguard
whicb it seems to me we have not at the
present time.
I would very gladly include France in a
league of that kind but that I feel it would
nlot be politie or advisable to do so, because
France is a European nation and bas enemies
confronting ber on tbree sides, and it would
be almost impossible for Frencb statesmen
and the ordinary Frencb citizen to see eye
to eye witb the people of the United States
and the Britisb Empire on many questions.
I suibmît for the consideration of my bonourabie friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)-4 am sure hie bas it in mind alreadytbat sucb a union would constitute a peace
organization very mucb more effective than
anytbing we bave had up to the present time.
Let it not be supposed that I am antagonistie
to tbe League of Nations. Ail strengtb Vo its
arm 1 But it bas noV mucb arm. I tbink
the League is stili capable of a great deal
of useful work in international affaira, and
I wisb it every success.
My bonourable friend from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) devoted a considerable
part of bis address yesterday to the proposed
Centrai Bank and tbe St. Lawrence Waterway Treaty. I do noV intend to discuss the
treaty in detail until it is before us for consideration. I saal also defer any extendcd
reference to the recommendation for a Central
Bank set fortb in-tbe Macmillan Commission's
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Hear, bear.
report until the Bill is before tbis Hlouse.
Witb regard to the St. Lawrence Waterway
Hon. Mr. -BLACK: I am, of course, exrny bonourable
pressing merely my own opinion. Now, Great Treaty, bowever, I sa
Britain, the principal country of our Empire friend'a grave doubts as Vo tbe advisability
group, is noV a European country solely. Sbe of developing tbe St. Lawrence along tbe
is on ber own island, separated from the lines proposed. In the first place, a very
continent, and bas more interesta in Asia, great expenditure of moncy would be required
America and India tban in Europe; and sbe to compiete tbe project, and wbiie it is al
is in every sense of tbe word a world nation very well Vu be reminded that Canada will
-mndeed the only world nation of to-day. be credited for ber expenditure on the New

order of the day in Soutb America. Wbilc tbe
outbreaks neyer became of great importance
to the world at large, tbey perbapa acted as
a safety valve for the exuberant feelings of
tbe nations concerned. Japan, wbicb aims to
be one of tbe lcading nations, and certaînly
tbe icading nation of the Pacifie, adbcred Vo
tbe League and was quite agreeable that tbe
League sbould function so long as it kept
everyone else from flgbting; but as soon as
Japan desired Vo figbt on ber own account, as
soon as she tbougbt it expedient Vo acquire a
bit of territory fromn ber next-door ncigbbour,
she wîtbdrew fromn the League and landed an
army in Mancburia, on Chinese Verritory, and
she is there now as a sovereign power. A
sirmIar tbing bappencd witb regard to Gcrmany. That country left tbe League because
sbe was not allowed Vo arm to tbe same extent
as were other European nations. So it seems
tbat as soon as any of tbe powers consider
that some advantage is Vo be gained by witbdrawal from the League, tbey witbdraw. The
sad part about the organization is tbat it has
no means Vo retain members against their
will.
I agree witb the statement by the bonourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
t'bat bad our great neigbbour Vo the soutb
continued in that course in wbicb it migbt
reasonably have been expectcd Vo continue
af Ver tbe Great War, present conditions migbt
be entirely different. In my opinion, if the
United States and Great Britain were working in co-operation tbey would bave enougb
moral influence, together witb tbeir military
and naval forces, Vo keep the rest of the world
in order. But the United States, for reasons
of her own, wbicb reasons we cannot criticize,
did not see fit Vo join the League.
Now, I do nlot tbink tbat because of its
failure, if it is a failure, tbe League sbould
be abandoned; but for many years I bave
had the feeling that a mucb more effective
League migbt be formed, one wbicb. would
have far greater influence towardsg maintainîng world peace than tbe League of Nations
bas, as it is presently constituted, and tbat
would be a league of the wbole British Empire and tbe United States of America.

SENATE

Welland Canal and on other portions of the
waterway, so thbat our actuail expenditure is
to be only about $50.000.000 in new monoy,
I would remind the House that our experience
of the difference between estimated and actual
expenditures on railwavs and other undertakings leaves little doubt that the actual
expenditure on the St. Lawrence Waterway
would be many times $50,000,000.
To-day
Canada is carrying a tremendous burden of
public debt and I do not think we can afford
to undertake any such expenditure unless the
increased revenue to be derived fron the
traffic to be developed will be sufficient ta
take care of the added liability.
I <lo not for one moment believe that
ocean liners will make Toronto, or North
Bay, or any port on the Great Lakes,
a terninal point. In the last twenty years
steamship owners have eut down the running
time of their boats to ten days and less. Is it
reasonable to suppose that they would accept
cargoes for delivery at inland ports and
thus lengthen the voyage by six, eight or
tan days, unless the shipping system of the
world were very much changed from what it
has been for the past fifty years? I doubt
very mueli the advisability of opening up
the great St. Lawrente Waterway-for many
hundreds of miles a Canadian river-to a
foreign power, and saying. "You shall have
the very same rights in this river as we have
to-day."
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
rights now?

Have they not those

Hon. Mr. BLACK:
No.
The United
States under treaty have certain rights on
the St. Lawrence river.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Easements.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: That treaty can be abrogated at any time. But do you suppose that
if we entered into the proposed treaty it could
ever be abrogated? That would be utterly
impossible. By the terms of the proposed
treaty they would be joint owners of the St.
Lawrence from its mouth to its source.
Honourable members will recall that in the
past we have entered into several agreements
with our neighbours to the south with respect
to waterwvays. They have never carried out
those agreements in the spirit in which we
understood them. I am aware that there are
reasons for their failure to do sa, but they
are not reasons which satisfy the Canadian
mind.
Let me instance the Erie Canal.
Many honourable members know more about
the construction of that canal than I do, for
they live alongside a part of its course.
One
of the terms of the Erie Canal agreement was
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

that Canadian barges and other boats should
have free use of the canal. How long was
that agreement observed? I an told that
after the first year the State of New York
said: "This is a State waterway entirely, and
we do not propose to be governed in this
respect by the federal authorities. We do not
intend to have Canadian barges carrying grain
through our canal." As a result our boats were
not permitted the froe use of the canal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I say that at
Whitehall the Americans actually stopped
Canadian boats that avere going down the
Richelieu canal, and they bad to unload there.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That confirms what I
have been saying. Thon thore is the diversion of water from the Great Lakes by the
Chicago Drainage Canal. Year in and year
out we have heard in this and in the other
House that the level of the Great Lakes was
being lowered because of the excessive diversion of water. From time to time our Government protested against the diversion. Finally the case was referred to the Supreme
Court of the United States and after a lapse
of three years the court rendered a decision
in our favour. But the diversion still goes on.
The State of Illinois laughs at Washington,
and Washington laughs at Ottawa. I might
mention other unfortunate instances, but I
will not trespass further on the patience of the
House. I think I have said sufficient to justify
my opinion that after these unfortunate experiences it would be unwise to enter into a
treaty which would give a foreign power further rights in the St. Lawrence river.
It is stressed by many people that after ail
improved navigation is not the paramount
object in view; that far more important would
be the development of electric power in conjunction with the deepening and widening of
the waterway. Well, I agree with that. I
agree also that there would ba enormous quantities of electric power developed by this
scheme. I know too, and so does every man
within the sound of my voice, as does every
intelligent, thinking man in Canada, that we
have in this country to-day as much waterpower developed as we can use at the present
time, and that in certain parts there is more
than we can utilize in ton or twenty years, or
possibly in three decades. That Ibeing so,
should we, at a cost of many millions of
dollars, develop a quantity of water-power
which we obviously cannot use, and which
therefore will bring no revenue into this
ccuntry? If we cannot sell that power to
industrial concerns on our own side of the
waterway, what will be the result? Obviously
there will be a demand on the part of the

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
larger population to the south of us for se
of our water-power..

Then there will be two things to consider.
It will be difficuit for the Government of tihis
country-any Government of this countryto say teo nir neighbours to the south, "We
cannot let you have so many hundred thonsand of horse-power"-even though it would
bring in five or ten or twelve or fifteen cents,
or whatever may be the rate per unit"because we shail want that power in the
future." The fact is that just as soon as our
Government-or I will say we, who are pressed
tor funds in order to meet the interest on
our debt, receive a reasonable offer for power,
we are apt to sdil it. That power can be sold
on a five, ten or twenty year contract, and
our friends to the south, taking that power
in a ten-year contract, would establish plants
on the American side. T'owns invariabiy
,spring up around such plants, and at the end
of ten ycars there would be probibly ten or
fifteen towns, each with one hundred thousand
or two hundred thousand inhabitants. I ask
you, at the end of the ten years would our
-neighbours to the south willingly consent to
the cancellation of those power contracte, the
abandonment of those towns and the closing
of those factories? I say they would not.
This is another reason why I have very grave
doubts at the present time as to the advisability of developing the St. Lawrence Water~way in the interest of the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: My honourable friend
-opposite (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said that lie
was opposed to the establishment of a Central
Bank. Re made some statements with which
I cannot agree. In the first place hie said,
"If we establish a Central Bank in Canada
ffty per cent of ail the branch banks in the
country wiil be closed." I cannot accede to
that statement. I see no reason for it, do nlot
believe it for a moment, and have neyer 'heard
anyone give any figures to justify it. The
honourable gentleman paid a great tribute
to our banks, and intimated that they were
-almost perfect; in fact, I think lie said they
%vere perfect. 1 yield to no man in my admiration of the banking system that we have
in Canada. It is a splendid systemn and has
.served the interests of Canada through
periods of stress in a most rems>rkable manner.
Nevertheless, a bank, like any other business
.concera, is essentially and primarily designed
and established for the benefit of the sharehoiders, in order to make money for the
people wbo have invested in that institution;
and quite properiy so. I wa.nt to say further
that the banks in Canada were not always in

33

the sound position which they occupy to-day.
They have not always served the people of
Canada as well as they are serving them today. Wiy lias the situation changed?
It
is because this Parliament from time to time
bas put safeguards around the hanks, and at
every revision of the Bank Act, which was
first passed in 187,1, lias increased those safegiuards, se that our banks stand to-day in an
enviable position and have been a great blessing to this country, and consequently to the
whole British Empire. It is only fair to caîl
attention to some of these things, because we
must not let ourselves be misled into thinking
that our hanking system bias been made perfect by the 'banks themselvcs. That is not so.
In this connection may I oaîl attention te
one or Vwo points? Some of the banks in
Canada were estabiished Weore Couafederation.
Il my memory serves me ariglit, the firet two
were the Bank of Montreal and the Bank of
New Brunswick. 1 think tliey were both established in 1822. The third was the Banuk of
Nova Scotia, chartered by the province of
Nova Scotia in 1831. The charter of the
Bank of Montreal is almoat a replica of that
of the Bank of New York, wbich was founded
when New York was a British possession, its
charter being very similar to those of the
Scotch banks. Since that time the charters of
our banks have followed similar lines.
The double liability clause appeared in
the Act by which the Bank of Nova Sootia
was eetablished. I do noît think it aq>peared
in the Acts establishing the Bank of Mosstreal
and the Bank of New Brunswick. That clause
was incorporated into the Bank Act of Canada
in 1871.
In the first revision of the Bank Act, whîch
was made in 1880, Parliament enacted a
provision that bank notes were to be made
a prior lien on jthe assets of the banks. Thaît
was a very wise provision, because previously
the notes had no-bhing behind them but the
money that the banks miglit have in thefr
vau t.
May I interi ct here that thoit is one of
the .two great points that have made the
Canadian banks se much more stable and so
mueli safer for the inveetor thein the bmenk
in -the republic to the south of us. In the
United, States the banks have flot in many
instanceis been real banks oit aIl; they have
been a combination of ksan companies, insurainoe companies, land companies and banks,
and 'whichever businesse was the Moet Profitable

fortunate in our bianking system, in having
it under the control of the Doinrnion (3overnment ever since Confederaition. Unif-orm laws
and regulations throughout the country have
been thue saving fewtuire of that systemn.
ln the first revision of the Bank Act, as 1
have said, Parliament provided that bank
notes were to, be a pýrior lien on the assef s
of the banks. In addition if, was provided
that fonty per cent of the cash reýserveîs of
every bank doing 'business in Canada should
be jnvested in Dominion notes.
The second revision was in 1890. In the
meantime there had been a number of bank
failures. In that ycar Parliament created the
bank circulation redempt ion fund and required
the banks f0 deposit witli the Minister of
Finance five per cent of thieir average yearly
note circulation, and more if the Government
thoughit necessary. If the liquidators of a
bank that had failed did not bave enoughi
money available to redeem the bank's notes
from the two sources provided in 1880, the
notes were to bc redeemed out of this fund.
There were more 'bank failures before the
next revision of the Act t ook place in 1900,
in which year the Canadian Bankers' Association was incorporated. There had been
a Bankers' Association formed three years
before, if my memory is correct, but. while it
no doubt did some good, it was only a consulting body, without a constitution recognized
by the Government. It was very much like
the League of Nations in that it could not
enforce anything. Parliament provided for
control by a curator over a suspended or bankrupt bank pending appointment of a liquidafor. The Government had the right to appoint
a man as liquidator, and it was given the
power to maintain dloser supervision over the
issue and distribution of bank notes. I will
net go into the details, because it is a long
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

story. and it is enough) to say here that ail
these matters were madle subject to the
Treasury Board.
Up to that time a conisiderable number of
banks had failed. In the flrst twenty-three
vears after Confederation ten banks failed and
nine withdrew from business or were absorbed
by other banks. Each bank failure apparently impressed upon the legislators of the
time fhat the inferesfs of the people who did
business with) our banks were flot properly
safcguarded and that there ivas much that the
Government could do to improve the situation.
Thýen. in 1913, came the establishment of a
central gold reserve, four trustees bcing empowered to receive fromn the banks deposits
of gold or Dominion notes. against which the
banks might issue an equal amount of their
own notes. That was a v.ery significant
change. After that amendment banks couid
issue notes only in proportion to the amount
of gold reserve or Dominion notes which they
had deposited here with the Minister of
Finance.
In 1923 section 88 of the Bank Act, which
we ail have heard discussed in this House and
elsewhere, was enacted. While it has been
strongly criticized by many people, it seems
to be a necessary section. Our banks have
neyer been allowed to lend money on mortgages or real estate of any kind, and if the
business of the country was f0 be conducted
on a larger scale in the future than it had been
in the past, it was necessary to make it possible for large organizations fo borrow money
on their available assets. Briefly, section 88
empowers a bank to make such boans, and
that is ail it does: a hank can take a prior
lien on the stock in trade and the available
assets of a large corporation and lend money
on that security. When a bank makes such
a loan it has a prier lien on the assets just in
so far as it bas advanced money against that
collateral. The section might militate to some
extent against the interests of people to whom
money was owcd by a bank that failed, but
this disadvantage was more than offset by the
increased facilities for business which were
given to ail parts of Canada.
I will not deal further with this question,
because many honourable members present
know far more about it than I do. But I
want to say to my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Casg-rain) that, contrary to what hoe seems
to think, the banks are not infallible. They
are private institutions, working for their own
înterests, as they ought to do, and at the
samne time they are serving the public, as any
good business in Canada should. Our banks

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
have been safeguarded by enactmnents of
Parliament, and it is because of those enactments that the banks have so successfully
weathered the various financial storms through
which they have passed.
My honourable friend opposite said also
that a Central Bank was of no use in Canada
and 'apparently neyer would be of use. li
he had said that a Central Banik might flot
be opportune at the present time, I probably
would net have taken issue with him, at least
until 1 knew more about the question. I want
to keep an open mind for the tinie being.
When the matter cornes before a cemmittee
I shai want to hear the reasons why îît is
claimed we sheuld have a Central Banik just
now, and the reasons, if there are any, why it
ils contended that the estab]ishjment of a Central Bank should be postponed. But I arn
convinced that in the very near future Canada
would be better off with a Central Bank. I
can sc many things that such an organizationi
could and doubtless would do to iniprove the
financial situation in this country. The only
reason, it seems to me, that can be advanced
for delaying the creation of a Centrai Banik
is that in these times of stress the batiks may
not be able to est.imate to what extent they
would be affected by suoh an institution, and
until they were able to form an opinion they
might restrict credit.
I have read the Macmillan Report as carefully as 1 could, and I think it is a very excellent piece of work. 'While I do not agree
with ail that is said therein, I think that it
contains nu'ch that will be of great benedit
te Canada. I have made a nunxber of extracts, in my own words, of what I think the
report points ont as among the things that
a Central Bank could do for this country. In
the first place it states that there ils in Canada
an absence of any single banking authority
which, while linked by its activities with
national finance and comimerce, is nevertheless
detached by its constitution and the nature of
its administration fa'oi the ordrnary pursuits
of commercial banking. In other words, the
Commission suggests that a Central Banik
would be over and above the ordinary influences of persons and companies who wish to
horrow nloney, or to do any other business
with a bank, and it would be able to act with
a view to the welfare of the general financial
situation ail over the country. Whether this
would become true would, of course, depend
largely upon the constitution and management
of the Central Bank.
Then, it is contended that a Central Bank
would, be able to regulate the volume of
credit and eurrency. I will concede that this
74728-3à

35

could be done to a certain extent, but to. a
certain extent on.ly. It could not regulate
the whole volume of credit, because if it
did so it would beco-me the only bank in
Canada. In other words, it would become
an autocratic institution, which is something
this country bas no use for. But undoubtedly
a Central Banik, in co-operation with the
banke already established, could do a great
deal in regulating credit. It would be the
balance wheel and enable our whole banking
machinery to operate more satisfactorily than
it can at present.
The honourable gentleman opposite (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) stated that after the establishment cf a Central Bank the other banks
would not be permiitted to issue notes. That
is in accordance with the recommendutions,
and undoubtedly if a Central Banik is created
the issue cf palper currency will be turned
over to it. 1 quite appreciate that this
change would resuit in a considerable loss cf
revenue te our existing bank, and for that
I amn serry. But, as I said before, these banks
are business institutions, like any other corporations.
Governments have appointed
boards to exercise certain control over electrical development companies, telegraph and
tedlephene cornpa.nies, and so on, te prevexit
them from doing things detrimental te the
putblic welfare and te ensure that tee large a
percentage of earnings is net diverted te
dividends. In most instances the compaties
are net allowed te pay a larger div-idend
than eight per cent on the original value cf
their stock. Woll, &Hl
these concertis are cf
just as much importance te the life of this
country as the batiks are, because if we have
no industry we can have no banks. Why
should banks net be regulated by an everlord-if I may use tbat expression-in the
same way tohat other business corporations
are? A further consideration is that a
Central Banik would need some source cf
revenue, because we do not want te bave
te tax the people te pay for it. I amt sure
aIl honourabie memhbers will agree eur people
are taxed beavily enough now. It seemas te
me that one cf the principal sources of
revenue of the Central Bank woul be feund
in the issue cf paper currency, and I t>hink
this was in the mind of the commissioners.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-sTAYNTN:
Should
we net be indîrectly taxitig the banks if we
deprived them cf this source of revenue?
Hon. Mr. BLAiCK: One source cf revenue
woubd- be taken frc>m t.hem, for the bene~fit cf
the people cf Canada. 1Idu net thin-k there
ceuld be any objection te that.

36

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LYNC.H-STAUNTON: But it
would be a tax on the banks just the same.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I know that the banks
do make some money on the circulation of
their own bills. It is quite proper that they
should (o so. Further, they get considerable
advertisement in this way, because the bills
are circulated throughout the country with the
names of the issuing banks on them. The
issue of notes is profitable to the banks for
another reason. Most people some time or
other lose a bank note or two. Perhaps my
honourable friend bas lighted his pipe with
one. People do that sort of thing sometimes.
In any event, a certain percentage of these
bank notes is lost. Suppose a house takes fire
and some bank notes are burned. The owner
of the house loses the money and the bank
that issued the notes is the gainer.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: How much do the
banks make on their notes?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: My honourable friend
will have to ask the banks about that. I am
very sympathetie towards the banks, because
they have performed a valuable service in this
country, but it seems to me that any loss of
revenue the banks would suffer because of the
issue of notes byv a Central Bank would not
in itself be a suflicient reason for us to decide
not to have a Central Bank, if such an
institution can operate to the benefit of our
country in the way that it is expected to do.
Referring further to the Macmillan Report,
I find that anotber reason given for the
establishment of a Central Bank is that it
would be endowed with the primary responsibility of maintaining the external stability
of the country's currency. Well, that is a big
order. We are the fifth trading country in
the world to-day, and undoubtedly we shall
limb higher, but it is pretty difficult to
imagine a country with only ten and a half
million people being able to do mach through
a Central Bank towards the regulation of
world currency. Undoubtedly, however, such
a central organization could do mucbh towards
stabilizing our own currency.
The report further states that the Central
Bank would be able to furnisb the Government of the day with impartial advice on
matters of financial policy. One of the
reasons advanced for a similar institution
in Australia was that a Central Bank would
be able to advise the Federal Government on financial conditions, not only throughout the country, but all over the world. The
reports of the Imperial Conference show that
strong recommendations were made in favour
of the establishment of a Central Bank in
Hn. Mr. BLACK.

every Dominion, and this ability to furnish
the Government with impartial advice was
stressed as one of the most important
advantages that would accrue.
Furthermore, the report claims that the
Central Bank would act as a stabilizer in
matters of foreign exchange and also in
domestic exchange. It may be said that these
are the same thing, but they are not. When
exchange in the United States was 20 t 25
per cent against us there was no real reason
at all for such a high rate. Our dollar was
then worth only 75 cents in the United States,
yet we had just the same amount of gold
then ais we had when our -money was at par
with the American dollar, or when our money
was at a premium of 2 or 2½ per cent. Also,
we had the same population as before, the
same type of people, a type that has proved
itself equal to any in the world. We had all
our vast resources, fertile farms, magnificent
forests, mines of untold wealth, and our great
fisheries. The high rate of exchange against
us was due simply to psychology plus manipulation on the New York Exchange. It is
true that we had large obligations in the
United States and were required to send over
big sums in payment of interest on borrowings by our Dominion and provincial governments and large industrial institutions, and
the manipulators of Wall Street took advantage of that situation to build up the exchange against us much higher than I believe
it should have gone. I think a Central Bank
could do a great deal towards preventing a
situation of that kind.
Reading between the lines in the Macmillan
Report, I have formed the opinion thaf a
Central Bank might be able to look after
other exchange conditions. If I had wanted
to buy a bill of exchange on New York this
morning I should have had to pay one and
seven-sixteenths per cent, but if I had some
New York funds that I wanted to bring in
here I could get only three-si-xteenths per
cent. These figures were given to me this
morning. Every bank is entitled to a reasonable -commission, but I maintain that the
people of Canada who have to pay their bills
in New York have had to pay too high a
rate of commission. One-sixteenth of one per
cent on a large 'transaction ranging from
$100,000 up to $1,000,000 is an ample rate;
for smaller sums a rate of one-quarter of one
per cent is sufficient. We know the money
is not actually transferred on the particular
day of the transaction, 'but thait laiter on,
through the clearing-house, balances are adjusted between one bank and another. In
this connection a Central Bank should have

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
some regulatory powers whicb, couid ha axercised without any real injury Vo the bankIs.
The report states that a Central Bank wdll

In Grat Britain the Bank of England is the

honouroble members will, I amn sure, be surprised to see what it costs this country Vo pay

I -have vantured to deai with this subWet
somcwhast fuiiy because it seemed Vo me that
my bionourable friend frora De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) was creating a wrong
impression as to tbe relative funct.ions of our
cbartered banks and the proposad Central
Bankh.
With ýrespect te bis giowisig tributs to the
British Empire, I am in full aoord witb
everything hie said.
Before my honourabie friand rasumed bis
seat last night hae amiused me by bis refaranca Vo Providence. For my part, I bave
neyer faît that Providence bad very mucb
to do witb politics. I bave aiways tbought
that in the political field wa are lefV pratty
much Vo our own devices. My bonourabla
friand instanced the prosperity of this country
under tha Laurier regime. He said that avery
time Sir Wilfrid Laurier was in power Canadian Pacifie stock soared, and that it reached

37

a high mark of 240. As a matter of fact, it
really went to a peak of 267k. I should be
very sorry to ga-uge our national prosparity
*3y stock market quotations. 1 should think
the late illustrious leader of the Liberal party
would have resented being given credit for
the inflation of the Canadian Pacifie or any
other stock, or being held responsible for the
vast amount of m-oney that this inflation bas
cost the citizens of Canada and foreign investors. Canadian Pacific stock was neyer
worth 265 or anything like it. The only value
of a stock is in the return it pays on the
invastment, plus its future potentialities. To
show the fallacy of my honourabie friend's
argument, I may say that the highast dividend the stock ever paid on the old valuation
was $10 a share. When, a few years ago, the
stock was split into four it paid three per
cent. Does anybody suppose that thrae per
cent was an adequate return on an investment
subject to govarnment regulation and to market fluctuations and changes in traffic conditions? Certainly not. No person should
invest, axcept for speculation, in an industrial
stock that does not pay at least six par
cent, and even at that bie is taking a vary
long chance. My honourable friend's argument in this respect is as faiiacious as many
other arguments advanced on behaîf of the
party wbich hie se loyaily supported. We
seldoni talk politics in this Chamber, but I
could not refrain fromn drawing attention Vo
what 1 consider a most absurd argument.
I amn glad to ha able to agree witb what
has been said in another place, that prosperity
is slowly coming back. Undoubtadly it would
be most unfortunate for Canada and for the
world generally that we should jump back
immediately into prosperity, for if we did,
in ail probability we sbould jump immediately
out of it into the slougb of anothar depression.
A slow, graduai, general recovery is what is
neaded to put this country on its feet.
Let me give some of the evidencas of raturning prosperity. The wealth of a country
is derived from four sources only: the soil,
the forests, the mines and the sea. Everything aIse is built up on those four basic
sources of wealth. I have always feit that
the financial set-up of our country and the
usage of the world for ganerations past have
tended Vo deprive the primary producers of
the true results of their toil. The farmer
who by the. sweat of his brow produces a
crop, ba it wheat, hay, potatoas or anytbing
else, is entitled to the first fruits--the cream.
Not only does the farmer not get a fair share
of the wealth hie produces. but other primary
producars are similarly unfortunate. The

that is 'being produced. While we may not
have again reached the peak, there are indications that we are really making progress,
and I think we can congratuls.te ourselves
upon having weathered the storma as well as,
or perhaps better than, any other country in
the world.
In conclusion let me say this. This country,
like every other, has passed through a period
of stress, 'but we have passed through it with
]ess serious loss, perhaps, and with fewer heartbreaks, than many other countries. Undoubtedly that is due in part to the soundness of
our financial institutions, particularly the
banks, and I want to give them great credit
for it; but it is due also, and in greater
measure, to the fact that we have had in this
country-and I do not say -this from a party
standpoint-a Government that has flot been
led sway by fals ideas, but has kept its bande
steadily on the helm of the ship of state and
guided it successfully through the whirlpools
and past the rocks which have almost wrecked
niany other countries.
Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
H1onourable senators, 1I shah flot entertain
or bore you for long, for I read ini the
Ottawwa Journal -this morning th-at nobody

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

in the reinarks that I have Viomake.
The subI ect of how we are going to resuTreot humanity, how we are going -to -change
conditions in this worki artificially, instead
of allowing them Vo improve naturally, in the
same way as they have 'been going downward, is exci.ting the attention of a vast
number of people. I 'have read with great
interest aU- the arguments that have came

-and I leave it at that. The only real conclusion I have reached is that it is a case of
the blind leading the blind; that it is beyond
the capaoity of puny man to, right the affaire
of the world; that he is no more able to, control
the affairs of the world than he is Vo govern
the weather. Re can talk about these things,
and he does talk about them, but that is the
end of it all. We can sec that man's intelligence and man's ability are strictly limited.
We have had numberless comings out of the
river of the lean kine, ever since the beginning of history, and we shail continue to have
them as long as history is made. The world
must recover of itself, and it will.
Some people are opposed Vo public ownersbip because they think that business je
carried on better, more economically and
more Lenefi'oially for the world under private
ownership. I am, I confess, opposed Vo public
ownership, but noV because I believe business
is carried on better by private interests, for
I am quite sure it is noV. I 'have seen men
who had the control of great corporations and
great business enterprises fail just as often as
governments have failed; I have seen thcm
commit just as many extravagances and give
just as many exhibitions of bad judgment as
governments. My reason for objecting to
public ownership is that I do not think any
government has any right to make ail the
people responsible for its actions. Takc the
operation of the Canadian National Railways.
The people have to carry the burden. They
should neyer -have had to do that, and with
my last breath I shall say that I did my
country the scurvie-t trick I ever did it, when
1 voted in favour of our Vaking over the railways. No business lasts forever; some day it
comes a cropper. We should let the chances
be taken by private citizens, noV the public,
who have no control.
Now leV me tell you in a few words ahl I
know about the Central Bank. I agree with
the bonourable gentleman to my lefV (Hon.
Mr. Black). He has said everything Vhat I
would have said about exchange, with one
exception. I asked a banker friend of mine
one day if he could explain what exchange
was. "Yes," he said, "I can, quite clearly."
"What is it?' I asked. "Well," he said, "I
know that it is invariably against me. That
is ail there is about it." My honourable
friend said that exchange in Canada varied
day after day while conditions remained the
same, and that this variation was brought
about by "rigging" in Wall Street. I believe
he ie quite right.
Once, many yea.rs ago, I had a delightful
interview with a very distinguished representative of Barclay's Bank. 1 said, "The centre

i4

SENATE

of finance bas changed to New York." This
was a feeler on my part. He looked at me
and smiled. I said, "Do you agree?" "I do
not," ho said. "Well," I said, "everybody says
so." To this ho replied, "Ah! But ilt bas not,
and it never will." When I asked why, he
said: "Because the Americans do not understand exchange. There are none except perhaps the Dutch and English who understand
exchange, and if people do not understand
exchange they cannot control the finances of
the world." I think the gyrations of the
American financiers since then bring home the
truth of what that gentleman said.
General Johnson said the other day, and
he put it in writing, that America would
never succeed until financial America became
of the same character as-I will not use the
word ho did-as financial England. He said,
"The Bank of England bas existed for two
hundred years, and there never was a scandal
in it." You know, it is not merely knowledge,
but character that brings success. I do not
know anything about finance from my own
experience, but I do know that I would
rather trust the experience and judgment of
the English financial world than any other.
I regard the financiers of America as being
still in their apprenticeship, and I would
rather look to England for financial, commercial, or any other material advice than to
any other country in the world. I am quite sure
that the right honourable the Prime Minister consulted the great authorities in England before he launched the Banking Commission, for he so announced before the Commission reported; and I feel confident that
he is acting upon the mature judgment of
the great English authorities on finance; therefore I believe that the best remedy for our
troubles is the one which must have been
recommended to the Prime Minister in England, namely, a Central Bank.
Now I want to say a few words about the
St. Lawrence Waterway. I think that the
Waterway Treaty should be brought before
this House now for academie discussion, and
that wc should have every possible opportunity to discuss it before it comes up for
final consideration in Parliament. We must
remember that this treaty is being made for
all time-until this world withers; that it is
meant to bind not only us, but all generations
of Canadians. I believe, therefore, that every
word in it should be subjected to the most
searching emamination and criticism that we
can give it. I have been considering this
treaty somewhat, but have not brought a
copy of it with me, as I did not intend to
speak about it, and did not think it would
come up during this debate. I want to point
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

out two things which make me doubtful
about the treaty, and which are at all events
arguable. Of course, my conclusions may be
entirely wrong.
The first matter I wish to speak of is this.
There was a discussion somewhere in the
United States as to the right of the American
people under this treaty to divert or dmsw
off the water of the St. Lawrence river for
power or other purposes. A letter was written
by Mr. Stimson to Mr. Herridge. I have not
the letter here; so I shall speak of it only
in a general way. Mr. Stimson said: "Such
and such a construction bas been put upon
a certain clause of the treaty. I understand
it to mean so and so. What do you understand it to mean?" To this Mr. Herridge
replied. Now, I say that no such discussion
should have taken place. Once the treaty
is before us, why should either Government
give an opinion as to its meaning? Yet the
American Government puts an interpretation on it and asks the Canadian Government if it agrees that that is what the treaty
means. This shows that the interpretation
of the treaty is uncertain and must be construed by an outside letter. The Americans
will be satisfied, because Mr. Herridge accepts that statement as to the meaning of
the treaty. Fifty years froe now a question
may arise and the treaty may be interpreted
not by its own wording, but by the construetion placed upon it by those two gentleI say that such an expression of
men.
opinion is most unwise. If there is any doubt
about what the treaty means, let it be
amended.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the debate in
the American Senate bas there been any reference to the exchange of letters between Mr.
Stimson and Mr. Herridge, which the honourable gentleman mentions?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STATNTON: Not that
i know of. I saw the copies of the letters,
that is all. Mr. Herridge and Mr. Stimson
mîay be absolitely correct in their interpretation, but some day it may be to the interest
of someone to dispute that. Is not the proper
interpretation to be found in the treaty itself?
Are these letters to be part of it, or is it wholly
enbodied within the four corners of the document purporting to contain it? I think it
would be imprudent to pass such a treaty before we are advised what it all means.
I consider, honourable members, that this
is a very, very important matter, and we
should be careful in what we do, lest our
descendants have cause to complain that we
entered into an unwise treaty. Wb are all
the time blaming our predecessors for things

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
they did. The other day I was talking to a
man about this treaty and I remarked, "I
hope it does flot pass."l He said, "So do V."
I asked him bis reasen, and he said: "I have
.iust one reason. We neyer had a deal with
the Ulnited States in which we did net get
the short end of the stick." I repeat, honouraible members, that again and again we
hear complaints about how badly negotiations
Nvith foreign countries were managed by oui
predecemsrs, and we should be osieful to
give no cause to our descendants to find fault
with what we do in this matter.
Article viii of the treaty provides:
The High Contracting Parties, recogni.zi.ng
their common interest in the preservation of
the levels ef the Great Lakes System, agree:
(a) 1. That the diversion of water from the
Great Lakes System, through the Chicago
Drainage Canal, shall he reduced hy December
31, 1938, te the quantity permitted as of that
date hy the decree of the Supreme Court of
the United States etf April 21, 1930.
And here ie the destroyîng clause, in my
iudgment:
2. In the event of the Goverument of the
United States proposing, in ord-er to meet an
emergency, an increase in the permitted diversion of water and in the event that the Goverument of Canada takes exception to the proposed
iucrease, the matter shahl he submitted, for final
decision, to an arbitral tribunal which shall be
empowered te authorize, for such time and to
such extent as is necessary to meet sucli
emergency, an increase in the diversion of water
beyond the limits set forth in the preceding
sub-paragraph and to sftipulate such compensatory provisions as it may deem just and
equitable; the arbitral tribun-al shaîl consist of
three members, ene te be appoiuted by each cf
the Governments, and the third, who wiIl be
the Chairman, te be selected by the Governmente.
To use a common expression, I view that
cbiause with alarm, and I will say why. In
the opinion cf very eminent lawyers in the
United States, Congress has heen passing
legisiation which overrides the provisions cf
the federal constitution, and States have been
enacting laws tiha't override their own State
constitutions.
The State of Minnesota
adrmittedly bas overridden its constitution.
One person brought an action to test the
constitutionality cf a certain statute. The
court admitted that it was unconstitutional
aceording to the letter cf the law, but said
that constitutions, kike ail other laws, were ever
speakdng and muet be adapted te, existing
conditions. An emergency had arisen ini
Minnesota. There was ne proof of any, but
the court saîd there was one, and therefere
the law, which was at other times uncoustitutional, m*uet be considered te be constitutional
in the e'mergency. Whbat an emergency
means, nobody hais defined. This treaty hae
not.

41

The American Congress bas given the
President control ever the lives, liberty and
property ef ail the people in the republic,
and it is said over there that when the questien comes before the Supreane Court cf the
United States there wiIl be an admidssion that
the action cf Congreas is unconstitutional,
but tihat nevertheless the constitution is
"9ever speaking," thaýt an emergency has
arisen, and people must be deprived cf
liberty in an emergency.
What emergency can be imagined that
would justify a further depletion of the
waters of the upper lakes? The Cýanadiau
and the American records mun baek for perhape seventy years, and we know that at this
moment the water in the St. Lawrence and
the upper lakes is lower than it has ever been
in that time. Is there an emergency now?
Ought Chicago to be allowed te diivert more
water than iV is diverting at present? It
appears from. the treaty thut the time Ma'y
reason.ably be expected te come when Chicago
will take more water and make the lskes
shallower than they are to-day. Se far as
1 con see, ne eîmergency can he conceived
of-and I challenge any persen te suggest
one-that would entitie the Americans te
lower the water stili further, but as surely
as we are alive ià will be done if tihis treety
is passed. The only emergency that can
entitle thein t, f urther diversion is an
emergency which affects Chicago.
Hon. Mir. TANNER: Is not Lake Michigan whohly in the United States?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

nation shahl noV take water away from. an

within their own territory, because the water
that goes into Lake Michigan runs ont into
our country, and any drainage from that lake
is being taken from us just as surely as if
Lake Superior itself were 'being tapped. The
American and the Canadian peoples must
neither directly for indirectly interfere with
the international waters to the detriment of
cither country.
Honi. Mr. DANDURAND: That principle
lias been recognized by the Supreme Court.
Yes. But
Hon. Mr. LYNýCH-ST-AUNTf-N:
suppose some years from now ýChicago says
tbere is an emergency. Who could deny that
tijere ivas? There is nothing in this trcaty to
say that before an emergency is considered
to exist bothi countries must be in agreement
on the matter. Chicago need on]y allege that
there is an emergency, and then it is entitled
to a board of arbitration, which board is
bouind to give relief, because the treaty recognizes that Chicago is entitled to more watcr
in the event of an emergency. In my opinion
tFat cancels anv beneficial cffects that would
otlîerwise flow from the clause. If sncb a
board is set up, the Americans will say to it:
'There is an emergenc 'v or you would not be
bore, and the emiergency is one that demands
more watcr, or you w'ould not be bore. Von
cin give us more water for as long as you like,
or for ever."
To my mind, that kind of question should
never be lof t to a board of arbitration, even
if it were tboughit advisable to leave it to a
body of some sort. If such a -board were set
up, we should appoint one member, the
Americans would appoint another, and the
third would possibly :be a foreigner. Well, I
think the foreigner would be influenced far
more by the contentions and prestige of a
country of one bundred and thirty millions
than by those of a country of only ten millions. It would be like going to law with
Satan before a court in Satan's domain.
I have been given this argument, that if
Chicago wants to take more wateýr we shahl
bc supported by aIl the states bordering on
that great international highway in our stand
against further diversion. But I do not want
to depend on American help. I prefer to
depend upon the strength of our contract.
1Some people say that even if we take every
possible care with the contract, the Americans
need not live up to it. My answer to that
is that the Americans are just as likely as
any other nation in the world to r~espect a
treaty, but if you give them an opportunity
to take advantage of any uncertaînty tbey will
act the same as any other nation and take
that advantage. And so 1 say that so, far as
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

is humanly possible the treaty should be made
Lomb-proof.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable members,
I did not intend to speak at this time, as the
subjects I propose to draw to your attention
mighit more properly come up when each of
the issues is before the House f or general discussion. Faced, as I understand we are, with
the prospect of an early and extended adjournmont, due to lack of business before the
Honse, I offer my observations to-day in the
hope that this honourable House may see fit
to bake at least soime of them under immeýdiate
consideration and thus do its part in helping
to solve the serions issues wbich confront the
country.
May I say that I think the people of
Canada have but a very vague and quite
erroneous impression as to the responsibility
of this honourable bouse with respect to government. 1 make bold to suggest that some
honourable member with long experience both
ini this and in the other House, as well as
in the Governmcnt, should make a very clear
staternent on the responsibility of the Senate
and the scope of its authority. In this way,
1 am sure, we should bear much less criticism of this honourable body by reason of the
long adjourniments which are necessary from
time to time for lack of business.
First, I wish to offer my congratulations to
the Government on the remarkable accomplishments it bhas effected so far. 1 am sure
I express not only the views of the party to
which 1 belong, but *of tbousinds of other
Csmadians in ýaIl -parts of Canada, when 1
say that we are indccd fortunate in these
tbimes to have at the head of our Government a man bold, courageous and efficient,
whose high principles exemplify what is best
in our Canadian citizenship. Undoubtedly,
Canada in its Prime Minister bas the right
man in the riglit place at the rigbt time.
This does not necessarily mean that we agree
with him in everything hie does, but by and
large his record is one of which be bas a rigbt
to feel proud.
We should be blind indeed if we were to
overlook the fact that the great issues confronting the Canadian people have yet to be
solved. If any doubt remained as to this,
the speech the right honourable the leader
of this Huse made yesterday should have
removed it. With that speech I am entirely
in accord.
Mr. Roosevelt neyer made a truer statement
than when, addressing Congress a few days
ago, be said, "We cannot go back from. here,
we must go nhead." Witb that I agree. If
this course is to be pursued there must be

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
great changes in our ideas as to what constitutes sound methods and procedure. In
this programme the greatest need is for a
large increase in credit issued on a sound basis
which wlll carry with it confidence. On this
subject I hope to have the privilege of offering some suggestions when the Central Bank
Bill cornes before thîs honourable House for
discussion.
Among the outstanding probiems which
stili confront us are: unemployment; cost of
goveramenit;
railway
deficits;
unsalable
wheat. This lest problem involves the
marketing of by far the most important
naturel produet of et least three of our provinces, a product which in the past contributed
in so large a measure Vo the prosperity of the
Dominion. Thougli the problem is of comnpara'tively reoent origiin, I regard it to-day as
of major significance in the restoration of
prosperity to Canada. This, too, we shahl have
an opportunity to discuss when the rega1ations
for acreage reduotion corne before us.
Two problems which I want to refer to at
the moment are railway deficits and the cost
oif governiment.
1 ar n ot taking issue with those who say
that Canada's credit stands high in Great
Britain, but 1 do say without fear of successf ul contradiction that the credit of Australia
in Great Britein is mýucli more fevourably
received than that of Canada. Inquiry as
to why this should be brings f orth the answer
from. the financial men in London that we
have flot yet put our bouse in order, and that
until we do we shahl not receive in England
the fuit credît which. we should otherwise
deserve. They invarîably refer to, our railway deficits as of first importance.
When our railway problem was before us
Iast year I took the ground that a unified
management, with an equitable distribution
of net revenues to each company, was essential if we hoped to escape from future deficits
in the operetion of our national railway. At
that time we were not justified in legisiation
which wouid compel the C.P.R., a private
corporation, to accept such direction. Since
that time, the Govemment lias found it
necessary to guarantee te, the banks a loan
of sixty million dollars to the C.P.R. 1
think it may safely be assumed that, a
precedent having been established, the bankers
of the world wiii insist on a similar guarantee
for future C.P.R. meturities. Such being the
case, this Perliament wouId certainiy be
justified in insisting on single management
for our raiiways. I was hopeful that the
Government, recognizing the cbanged situation, wouid have withheld the appointment
of the Raiiway Board of Trustees and brouglit

43

in effective legisiation for single management,
which alone promises soivency for our railways, and is essentiel to the credit and the
soivency of Canada itself.
The cost of government, perhaps more than
any other subjeet, is engaging the attention
of thoughtful -Canadians. Statements are
frequently made as Vo our inabiiity to pay
our bonded indebtedness, and the necessity
for a reduction in our debt. It bas been
suggested that the interest rate on our outstanding bonds be reduced, but this proposai
the Government thinks impracticable before
1937, when our tax-free bonds mature. Just
what is going to happen to us in the interval,
the good Lord only knows. I have grave
doubits about the success of any oampaign
f or voluntary acceptance of a reduction in
the present interest rates to 2ý per cent. I
behieve thet arbitrary legisiation with some
feature of compulsion may be necessary to
bring about such a reduction. Certainly our
credit will bave Vo be mucli bigher than it
is to-day i-f such a campaign is te succeed.
If arbitrary legisiation is enacted, is it not
repudiation? Is there eny difference between
the confiscation of principal and the confiscation of interest? Thet some readjiustment
in the bonded indebtedness of this country is
essential. is apparent to ail. flow Vo bring
it about is the question. That there must
be a readjustrnent with the debtor class in
this country if we are to have a returu of
prosperity is as clear as day. There cen be
no prosperity when our farmers are "broke."'
How is the readjustment te, be made? At
the expense of the creditor class, of course.
A reduction of the yardstick by wbich
business is measured is not new. There is
no other method of defiation without the
destruction of the business febrie. Reducing
the business mcasuring stick means a reduction ahl elong the uine.
President Roosevelt had similar problems
to meet. The solution was essentiel to enable
the opening up of the 5,000 United States
banks that had closed their doors. It was
aiso necessary in the interest of the insurance
and the trust companies, which held most of
the twenty billion dollers' worth of inflated
railway bonds and fifteen billion dollars' worth
of inflated building bonds, ehl now far below
par. Something had teo be clone. Hence we
find that yesterday Mr. Roosevelt established
the dollar on a fifty-nine-cent basis. A few
days before he seid that bis Government,
through ita stabilization fund, would prevent
the dollar from rising above sixty cents.

Bank is decided upon, our Government ehould

exceeding sixty cents, thus giving to Canadian business the stability which the Americans have found necessary to give to the
business men in their country. This means
a reduction of foriy per cent of the cost of
governinent and the cutting down of the principal as well as the interest on our Government securities. I do net expect that this will
have the approval of those who hold such
securities, but, after all, our dollar is worth
only sixty cents to-day. They would be
getting back a sixty-eent dollar, worth more
than the dollar they lent in 1929. I have long
felt that in one way or another a compromise
had to be made with the debtor class in this
Dominion, cutting the debt about in two.
Personally I favour su.ch a plan, believing that
half a loaf is better than no bread.
Heretofore, wben the United States was on
the gold standard, we had to pay one hundrud cents plus exchange. Such an arrangement would have meant bankruptey for our
industrial organizations
whose obligations
matured in New York. Now that the American dollar is reduced to sixty cents, no industry
will suffer froms a similar reduction in the
Canadian dollar, and certainly no company
should profit by it.
The people of Great Britain severcly critcize the Americans for going off the gold standard and deliberately pounding down their
dollar when they had more gold than was
required. Great Britain, on the other hand,
was forced off the gold standard, and the
stabilization fund has been used only to maintain the stability of sterling. Canada, on account of its obligations in the United States,
necessarily follows the American dollar. Consequently, we have no alternative and our
dollar is now worth only fifty-nine cents. It
is the opinion of some of the best financial
men in London that our position is analogous
to theirs and that we could no more be
accused of repudiation were we to stabilize
at the market value than the British would be
be if they stabilized their pound at the
present gold price, roughly 14 shillings.
As a matter of fact, a prominent British
economist, speaking to the members of this
Parliament, stated that the pound would net
be re-established at more than four dollars.
There is no talk of repudiation in that. There
would be no justifiable criticism. nor could we
be justifiably accused of repudiation, if we
were to stabilize our dollar at the market
price to-day. Devaluation has already occurred, and I submit that in the best interests
of the business of this country the Government should lose no time in announcing its
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

intention to stabilize the dollar at net more
than sixty cents.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Should
we net have to pay forty per cent exchange
on our debts to the United States?
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I have already explained
the difference between conditions prevailing
this year and last. Last year, when the dollar
was worth one hundred cents plus exchange,
the suggestion I an making would have
meant many extra million dollars te our industrial institutions that owed money in New
York; but to-day we are assured that the
Amcrican dollar wilI net exceed sixty cents.
Therefore no hardship would result to our
industries under my suggestion.
lon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Our debt
is payable in gold. Lately Mr. Justice Farwell held that a debt payable in gold was
payable in sterling, but a few days ago the
House of Lords decided he was wrong, and
the debt must still be paid in gold.
Hon. Mr. MoRAE: I have no doubt that
that would net apply in the United States.
for it would defeat the object the administration bas in view.
Recenitly I made a trip to Europe particularly for the purpose of getting first-hand
information on industrial and other matters,
and the remarkis which I am about to offer
are based on thait information. I went over
to Europe holding the view held, I imagine,
by most honourable gentlemen-that the
world was tariff mad, and that there was a
general tendency throughout the nations of
the world 'to let down the tariff barriers with
a view to extending international trade. I
regret to say that so far as I was able to
ascertain, that opinion was without any
foundation in fact. Quilte 'the contrary is
the case. Every country in Europe is endeavouring te put up barriers; and where the
tariff is not high enough, embargoes, export
licences and quotas are imposed. I am told
also that this is truc even of Mexico, and certainly it is true of the countries of South
America. So to-day we find the nations of
the world closing their doors against imports
and resorting ,to what might be called a
modern system of barter. The systen of
barter is very general in Europe, and only
lately we have seen the United States endeavouring to exchange hogs for Scotch
whiskey. There is not much encouragement
for increased exports on that basis.
Canada, unfortunately, on account of its
geographical position, camnot be self-support-

FEBRLT ARY 1, 1934
ing and self-contained. Our surplus of whea.t
offers an outstanding exaxnple of how badly
we need -foreign trade. In view of world
conditions as I sec them to-day, I am frank
to say to honourable members of this Huse
that roy opinions are very much changed with
respect to taeiffs and arrangements of that
kind. I believe ýthat our fuiture is tied ujp witih
the British Empire, and, although Great
Britain has flot yet oome to that way of
thinking, that the future of Grea.t Britaiýn
is tied up with that of the Dominions. If it
were possible for us t-o secure protection
against the rest of the world and to obt>ain
free entry into Gereat Britain and the Dominions, subject only teo such tariffs as might ha
necessary to maintain tihe different standards
of living, I ama free to say that 1 should ha
disposed to try free trade within tihe Empire.
I corne now Vo a subjeot upon which 4here
bas been some discussion in thia House. I
refer to the League of Nations. 1 quite
appreciate that what I am gomng Vo say will
flot be popular; that it may be resented,
criticized and objeoted te by men who know
very muoh more about t'he League of Nations
than I do. Nevert-heless, my observations,
and such confirmation as I was able Vo get
from. Continental and Brittish sources during
my short soj ourn abroad, have irnpressed upon
me once more the faot that the Versailles
Treaty, which tore up the maip of Europe
and placed the various races in untits by themselves, walled around by tariffs and other
harriers, lias given rise Vo racial ambitions
and racial hiatreds and distrusts that are
greater than have existed in Europe for fifty
years, and certainly greater than ever before
in the last twenty years. I met and talked
and lunched with no fewer than twenty.4lve
promînent men in France, Germnny and
Austria. Invarisibly I asked them. soe tinia
during the conversation whother I was iriglit
in believing that racial ambitions, haîtreds and
struggles were more ramnpant in Europe today than they hiad been twenty years ago,
and invariably I received the answer 4that that
wa-s correct. As I sec it, Europe is rapidly
becoming an armed camp. There is more talk
about war in Europe to-day than there wes
in the early part cd 1914. In xny judgment
a European war is a certainty, and probably
it will ocour within five years.
When I refer to the League of Nations
and criticize its work I am flot overlooking
the many good things it hae dona. I am
not unmindful of the splendid work it did
with regard to narcotica, the white slave
traffic anid many other thjings. But, as bas
been said in this House, the League, prohably

45

quite unavoidably, has failed in its main
objetive--international peace. The brotherhood of man, for which the League stands,
hus oertainWy made no progress in Europe
since the War. Our great Imperial statesmen,
Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Baldwin, whose
idealistie speeches quicken the blood of every
man who loves peace, are proving as impractical as they are idealistic.
I remember reading a speech mede by
Mr. Baldwin in bondon when I was there. He
said that Germany should be allowed. to arm
to the samne extent that France was ariued.
That sounds reasonable The Germans are
a great nation, and probably we should say
that that was just. But picture to yourself
the position of the Frenchman. I confess
that if I lived in France and were sure that
war was going to happen, 1 should want
France to go to war right away to clean up the
up the Germans wh.ile I was sure iA ould be
done. Sooner or later there wil be war between France and Germany; and you may
depend upmn it tihat; when Germany admits she
is as strong as France, she wilýl be stronger.
You are ail so familiar with the foundation
that Hitier is laying thait 1 need &ay nothing
about it, except that it is thorough and
extreme. You can read about it in the
papers.
When we find great nations like Germany
and Italy, already overpopulated, paying
bonuses for large families, are we too cynical
in saying that this is to provide cannon fodder
for the future?
We are a small nation-ten and a haif million people-to be taking part in this European embroglio. We are far away from the
continent of Europe. With the certainty of
war before us, I want to caîl the attention of
this honourable House and of the country to
the opportunîty that we have at this time to
withdraw with honour from the League of
Nations-an opportunity which subsequent developments may not afford. I appreciate the
seriousness of the statement that I am about
to make to this honourable House, but I am
giving my eonsidered, definite opinion when.
I say that I cannot conceive of any developments whuich would justify this country in
saorificing the blood of one single Canadian
on the future baïttle-flelds of Europe.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

SENATE

Surely we have troubles enough in our own
country to engage our entire attention. The
unempinyment situation, with its inereasing
fesqters on the body politie, is still witb us.
The graduates of the past four years from
our sebools and eolleges-thousands of Canadian boys and girls-are still uneznployed.
Sueh unemployment creates a situation whicb
is destroying the future of our Canadian
citizens.
In passing, may I mention a subject that
I think ougbt to have the attention of the
Government and of this House? I refer Vo
the thirty tbousand destitute farmers in the
southwest quarter of Saskatchewan and the
soutbeast quarter of Alberta-thirty thousand
fairmers whom we have been -assist.ing for
three years; tbirty Vhousand farmers whom
we shahl be assisting as long as they live,
unless we take steps to put theiii into somne
part o>f the coountry where Vhey can earn
a living.
The righ.t honourable gentleman
from Eganville (Righit Hon. Mr. Graham)
knows well the oontroversy there was witb
respect to, the settleimeot of thut country
in the early days. I was in the colonization
business. I inspeeted that country thirty years
ago, and at that time you could flot pull
enough grass off -a section in a day to fi11your
bat. When Sir Clifford Sifton was Minister
of the Interior he deelined to open up that
country. Re said it was a ranching country.
Hie was right. It should have been left to
the cows. Now we have tbirty thousand
families there, and we are feeding themn.
Relief in Saskatchewan is costing, I presumne,
$12,OO0,00O or $15,000,0OO this year. That canflot continue. The Government allowed those
people to go on that land. The Government
must take care of tbem. The people in that
section of the country do Dot need to worry
about their debts; tbey will neyer pay tbem,
for they have notbing to pay them with;
and I suggest that if we ever move them we
should give them a blanket bankruptcy and
start them ail off free of debt. These are
some of the things that this country bas to
deal with.
Witb the permiission uf the bonourable
senators wbo are wise in their years, and
wbo bave been in this flouse much longer
than I have, I want to say a word about the
Senate. This Senate, in my judgment, is the
ablest body of men in our Dominion to
investigate, discuss, .iudge, and tben recommend the best procedure to be followed witb
respect to the great problems now confronting
us. Believing this, as I do, may I express tbe
hope that the Government of the day will sec
to it that our services-paid for in any event
-are made use of for the benefit of the counHon. Mr. MeIIAE.

try we ail love so, much and are so eager to
serve.
If in my remarks I bave uttered any word
of discouragement to any of my fellow-citizeos, I wisb ta take this opportunity to set
their minds at rest. We in Canada bave mucb
tcu be thankful for. We are undoubtedly living in the 'best country in the world, a country
ricb in natural resources, and our oppnrtunity
for recovery and for national welfare is inflnitely greater than that of the peoples of
worked-out Europe. We are rich in citizenship. Our people bave in their veins the
blood of the best and most progressive nations
the world bas ever known. We eannot be
lacking in ability to sec ourselves through.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable memnbers
of the Senate, in considering the speech with
which His Excelleney opened Parliament, I
bave observed that few of those who bave
spoken-I would include even the moverhave confined themselves to the text of the
speech. I am therefore going to, follow their
example in the few words that I bave f0 offer.
The honourable gentleman who bas .Iust
taken bis seat bas said many of the things
that I intcnded saying. This will tend to
shorten my remarks. I agree thoroughly with
bis statement and bis point of view; and before going any further, lest 1 forget it, I wisb
Io make a remark with respect to the question
raised by the honourable member from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
as to
whetber, if there were an inflation of our
eurrency, we should be compelled to pay a
premium on the debts whieh we owe in the
United States and whiehi are payable in gold.
I wisb f0 remind the flouse of one incident.
Shortly but not immediately after President
Roosevelt was inaugurated as head of the
republie, Congress gave him the power to
prevent the exportation of gold from the
United States. The United States, althougb
a great ereditor nation, owed some buis in
Europe that were maturing and were payable in gold. The President of the United
States refused to, pay them in gold. The
newspapers of Europe, particularly those of
Great Britain, strongly protested against tbis
refusal, saying that it was a repudiation of
eontract, a violation of agreement, and used
aIl the other expressions that could be used
on an occasion of that kind. Nevertbeless, the
United States simply refused. If we followed
t1jeir example in that respect and paid in our
own currency the buis that we owe in the
United States, could tbey very well refuse to
accept tbat payment, in view of the policv
tlat tbey tbemselves adopted?

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
I will now say something that I think will
implement and strengthen what the honourable menber from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) said. A few years ago our sister
Dominion, Australia, was in a much worse
financial position than we were. Its population was much smaller, and I understood its
resources were not nearly as valuable; but as
a result of arrangements then made it is
now in a much better financial position than
we. And so far as I know, it achieved this
improvement by the inflation of its currency.
Within the last twelve months it was able to
borrow money in Great Britain at 3 per
cent, while the last loan that Canada floated
bore interest at 4j or 5 per cent, I think.
These figures give positive proof of the difference between the conditions in the two
Dominions.
The United States is inflating its currency
now, and I do not think we can avoid following the lead. France did the same thing after
the War, Sweden did so later, and so did
Japan. All these nations have found it worked
well, and the United States will probably have
a similar experience. Our debts are so large
that they cannot be paid in the ordinary way.
They must be scaled down or the instruments
of payment must be inflated, so that the
money value of the debts will bear some
relation -at the time of payment to what
it was when the debts were contracted.
I have listened carefully to the remarks of
the honourable member from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) as to the practical certainty of war in Europe within the next four
or five years. So far as my limited knowledge and experience enable me to judge, 1
feel that another war is almost a certainty,
and I think that the private manufacturers
of armaments will be largely instrumental in
bringing it about. If the governments of the
world are unable or unwilling to eliminate the
private manufacturer of arms and of war
rumours, war is inevitable. We in Canada
perhaps cannot do much to prevent a conflict, but we have some influence in the world,
and more in Great Britain, and we ought to
use that influence to the utmost in opposition
to the sataic efforts of the men who expeot
to profit by the next war.
I was interested in reading the speech made
by the honourable Minister of Trade and
Commerce

in

Toronto a

short

time ago,

and was pleased to see this statement in a
recent issue of the Ottawa Citizen:
One of the most sweeping investigations into
private corporations ever attempted in Canada
will be launched in the House of Commons
within the next day or two when Prime

47

Minister R. B. Bennett will move for a
preliminary probe into the buying methods of
chain stores, the big department stores and the
packing and milling industries.
I hope that investigation will go on, and
that it will bring results. An article in the
Ottawa Journal indicated that not much was
expected from the investigation, and predicted
that the committee of investigation would be
hampered in its work by the constitution of
Canada. Perhaps that paper was influenced
in its views by the comparative failures of
other investigations of more or less recent
date. It would be a pity if our constitution
prevented a thorough investigation into the
matters referred to by the Minister. It seems
to me beyond question that the old order
in the world is passing away. The unlimited
liberty of individuals and corporations to do
just about as they wish, regardless of the
welfare of the masses, cannot in my opinion
be allowed to continue much longer, and we
must be prepared to submit to many forms
of control that were thought unnecessary in
the past. Soulless corporations and individuals
who do not recognize their duty to their
fellows must be curbed. Therefore I think
the proposed investigation is a step in the
right direction, and I hope it may be the
beginning of a new order.
The right honourable leader of the House
and some other honourable members have
told us that the United States is the most
nearly self-contained nation in the world,
besides being the wealthiest and most highly
mechanized nation. When the present depression broke, that great country had in its
possession more than one-half of all the gold
in the world, and yet the American people
have suffered more from the financial crisis
than have the people of the war-torn and
bankrupt countries of Europe. There must
be some cause for this. I think that all the
countries of the world, and particularly the
United States, have drifted far away from
moral and spiritual values, and that this
drifting bas been responsible for far worse
resuilts than we are inclined to admit. I
read not long ago that in the city of Chicago
a leading gangster was murdered by a rival
gang. He was buried in a bronze coffin that
cost about $15,000, and was given almost a
state funeral. Two or three carloads of
flowers followed his remains to the cemetery,
and the worst feature of the whole incident
was that among the pall-bearers were four
or five judges. During his lifetime this
gangster had contributed much towards the
election of those men to the Bench. It seems
to me that justice in the United States is
contaminated at its very source.

48

SE.NATE

I think that the comparative immunity of
Great B3ritain and Canada from the worst
eifects of this depression is due to the morals
and chiaracter of the people. While in al
probability the UTnited States will benofit
greatl 'v from the step that President Roosevelt
is taking, it will have to be far more zealous
in exterminating crime than itlibas been in
the past before it can hope to bocome permianentl 'y prosperous. We ourselves can take
a lesson. from our neighbour, for we have
our own littie Renos and Hollywoods, and
conditions sucb as they represent have mnuch
to do with bringing about some of uur must
serions troubles.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Soniate resumed at 8 p.m.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honouraible sena-tors,
I had no intention whatever of detain-ing the
House with a general discussion, indeI
had no intention cf taking part in this debate. until I heard the remarks of certain
honourable gentlemen in regard to the St.
Lawýrence Waterway. While at this stage 1
shall not attompt 10 deal with this very important subjeet at any length, I foch that
something ought to be said on the other side.
As I understood them, scame honourable mcmbers this afternoon. were disposed to be
antagonistic to the whole proposition. I am
neot comimitted either one way or the other
nt the present time. I -think il is a little
early to make ibp our mindis finaily on the
subjoct, but I quite agree with my honourable
friend that we have the oppertunity now te
study the matter and be prepared te dispose
of il in the best interests of Canada when the
treaty comes before Parliament, if it ever
does. I have no cortainty in my mind thait
we shýal have te deal with the maatter Ibis
session. If we are te accept, what is being
said on the other siýde of the uine as an
aeeiîrate sulmming up of the situa tion, 4hat ali
the adva,,ntagos cof the proposod treaty are
with Canada, it is net very likely thiat %ve
upen te consider it in

this Huse. I need net tel honourable members that there is in Congress a very vigorous
op-position te the treaty, and that prominent
men from certain states of the Union are
contending very strongly that practicaily al
the advantages of thie treaty are with this
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We may hear
the contrary argument wben the Bill comeus
here.

Mr. HUGHES.

lon. Mr. TANNER: Yes. Therefore this
evcning I purpose 10 give te the lieuse some
information with regard te the tnatter. I have
boon endoavouring te gather information f rom
persons who in my jtidgment were competent
te give me semething depondable on the
subjeet.
I hope that Ibis information will
assist honourable members in their study of
the subjeet and belp them te ceme 10 conclusions that wvill be in the best interests of
Canada.
May I digress fer a few minutes? I was
muchi pleased this afternoen te hear my honetirable friend frein Vancouver say a goed
word for this Chamber. I do net thinik that in
the language lie used hoe at ail exaggerated in
regard 'te the caqacity of honourable mcmbers te deni with public matters. Last session
I ventured te suggest that the couiatry would
be a groat deal bottýer off if its affairs had
been wholly managed by the Sonate, and that
instcad of aboldshing this Chamber, as some
persons proposed, il might ho te the national
adv antage te ýaibolish the House of Commons.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

That statement

govcrned by a Parliament compesed of the
Sovcaorig-n, the Sonate and the bouse of Coimmens. WVe have a written constitution; the
Old Country bas net. As a malter of fact,
under our constitution the rights and powors
of the Sonate are on a parity with those of
the House of Commons, oexcept in one
particulair, the introduction of money bills.
But -the Sonate can deal with money bilis if it
chooses te do se. I presumne we are ail
familiar with the growth of the King's Privy
Council in England-how at first the King
calied in the counisoilors ho wanted, and dis-

FEBRUKRY 1, 1934
missed then Mt bis royal pleasu-re, and how
th-at systemn gradually developed into what
is known to-day as the Cabinet system. But
there is nothing in our constitution in this
respect, nor is it a legal principle in British
pardiamentary practice; it is aU a matter of
expediency and convenience. When we taIk
of the Prime Minister and bis Government
being responsible to the flouse of Commons
we forget that there is nlot an atom of constitutional authority to show anything but
the fact that the Prime Minister and his
Governinent are the instruments and the
officers of the Parliaanent of Canadla, not
merely of the flouse of Commons. It surprises
me that persons in this country who profess
to be great authorities on constitutional law
and practice should attempt Vo con'vince us
that the Cabinet in the other end of this
building is responaible to the flouse of Commens only, and not in the broad sense to the
whole Parliament. I do not think I amn
mistaken in saying that there were occasions
when the Prime Minister of Canada -had -hm
seat in the Senste. In England Lord Salisbury
and Lord Rosebery sat in the flouse of Lords
while they acted as Prime Minister. W'hat
would have been said if while they were ini
the flouse of Lords, corresponding to the
Senate in Canada, they had. told the flouse
of Commons: "'You 'have nothing -to do with
us; we are responsible only to the flouse of
Lords, because we ait in -the Uipper Oharnbe"?
They were responsible to the ParliamenDt of
EngIsand, just as our Prime Ministers are
responsible to the Parlijament of Canada.
W'hen a Cabinet is beiag formed there may
at times be juet as much reason for selecting
some of its members from. among those who
sit in the Senate as from among those who
sit in the Gommons. There is no constitutional bar against a Prime Minister
sitting in this Chamber and having hialf a
dozen members of hie Cabinet also, sitting
here. As I have already saîd, it is ail a matter
of expedliency and convenience. 1 think it
is only right and proper that some elight
protest at least should be macle against the
misl-eadïing doctrine propound-ed in another
place.
Now let me deai with the St. Lawrence
Waterway Treaty. Some persons, of course,
are against the developing of ou-r waterwaye.
In bis very interesting life of Sir Clifford
Sifton, Mr. John W. Dafoe gives us a rather
entertaining account of what happened when
the Government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier
decided to deepen the canais to fourteen feet.
hn important delegation from the district of
Mlontreal waited on Sir Wilfrid and pro-

49

tested that if the canais were deepened as
proposed, the port of Montreal would be
rumned. Sir Wii-frid listened very .patiently
and very pleasantly. Then the dèlegation
went home and he proceeded with the deepcning of the canal. To-day we have sorne
very vigorous proteste against the proposed
St. Lawrence Waterway. In Nova Scotia a
good mainy persons say they are against the
projeot. I have not heard thers give any
ressens for their opposition. As a matter
of fact, from the port of flalifax we have
a fleet of steamers plying right up Vo Port
Arthur. Their principal cargo is sugar, and
they bring clown foeur and feed. lt is a considerable trade. PersonalJy, in a general way,
iooking as I do upon the develapment of the
St. Lawrence Waterway as an enterprise
which eventualiy must go on and will go on,
though maybe not imnimediateIy, I try to
contempiate that waterway deveiopment as
one of the greatest events in the history not
oniy of Canada, but of the Maritime Provinces. There may be drawbacks in some
respects, but I am disposed to believe that
in a general way that development wili be
of great benefit Vo the province in whioh I
live.
Now I 'want to give the flouse a general
idea of the navigation courses from SauIt
Ste. Marie clown, and Vo remind honourabie
memibers about the locks at Sault Ste. Marie.
On one aide is what we cali the American
lock; on the other is the Canadian lock.
The capacity of the American iock is by
far the greater, and it is a fact that a large
part of the Canadian traffic now goes through
that lock.
On the route from Sault Ste. Marie on the
Canadian aide there are in Canada 481 miles
of navigation courses, and in the United States
671 miles. On the route from the United
States lock at the Sault there are on the
Canadian aide of the lakea and rivera 477
m of navigation courses, and on the United
iles
States aide of the channel 674 miles. I give
these figures because a great many people, I
think, have an idea that we own the whole
of the area of the rivera and lakes, and that
ail the navigation is on the Canadian side.
As a matter of fact the greater percentage of
the navigable courses is on the United States
aide of the lakea and rivera.
From Port Arthur to St. Mary's, across Lake
Superior, there are on the United States side
217 miles of navigation courses; on the CauadÎan aide only 29 miles. Through Lake
Huron, for 215 miles the navigation courses
are ahl on the United States side of the channel. In Lake St. Clair, which is only 18

SENATE
miles long, the navigation courses are again
all on the United States side of the channel.
Through Lake Erie we get the advantage:
on the Canadian side there are 198 miles of
navigation courses, and on the United States
side 21 miles. Through Lake Ontario from
Port Dalhousie to Tibbett's Point, opposite
Kingston, there are on the Canadian side 82
miles of navigation courses, and on the United
States side 76 miles. In the international section of the St. Lawrence River there are on
the Canadian side of the channel 58 miles,
and on the United States side 42 miles, and
on the boundary between the two countries
12 miles. As honourable members know, on
the route below the international boundary,
to Montreal, the 69 miles are all in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Welland
Canal too.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yes, of course there
is the Welland Canal too. I am not attempting to cover everything.
Now, some considerable time ago I asked
one of the ablest and best informed engineers
in this country to give me a statement for
my own personal information as to what
benefits, if any, this country would likely
derive from the treaty. That gentleman was
good enough to send me a statement of what
he called the "Benefits Accruing to Canada
under the St. Lawrence Deep Waterway
Treaty." I am going to give the House this
statement for what it is worth. I am not in
a position to judge whether this gentleman

is always right or not, but I feel that the
statement contains a fund of information
which ought to assist honourable members in
their study of this subject.

I do not want to

take up too much time. Perhaps honourable
members would prefer that I should hand the
statement to the reporter?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It consists of twelve
pages of typewritten matter.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Who is the author?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have no desire to
take up the time of the House in reading it.
All that I desire is that it should go into
Hansard. If that is all right, I shall hand it
over to the reporter.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We are agreed.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I thank you.
Benefits Accruing to Canada under the St.
Lawrence Deep Waterway Treaty
The Deep Waterway:
1. Canada secures a 27 foot deep waterway
from Port Arthur and Fort William to the sea
with all the attendant benefits to outgoing and
incoming traffic that are associated with low
eost deep water navigation.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

2. Canada secures

a deep waterway that is

practically as all-Canadian as is the Great
Lakes-St. Lawrence Waterway which lias been
developed to date.
3. Canada, furthermore, by the provision of
Article VI, establishes without question the
definite and unrestricted riglt to construct at
any time, now or in the future. completely all-

Canadian canal and channel facilities in the
International Section of the St. Lawrence and
in the waters connecting the Great Lakes, together witli the right to abstract such water as
may be necessary for the operation of the sanie.

4. The

works

at

Barnhart

Island

have

furthermore been so designed that at any time
in the future, if Canada so desires, canal
and lockage facilities can be constructed on the
Canadian side of the river. Canada can also
proceed with construction of deep water lockc-

age facilities on the Canadian side at Sault
Marie at any time such procedure should
appear to be dýesirable.
5. Canada retains complete proprietary riglts
and complete legislative, administrative and
operating control over all works located on the
Canad-ian side of tie international boundary.
6. Canada establishes as a basic principle

ISte.

tha.t the flow of water out of Lake

Ontario

into the St. Lawrence River and through the
International 1Section of the St. Lawrence River

shall at aIl tines be such as to ensure full pro-

tection to navigation in the Harbour of Montreal and throughout the navigable channel of
the St. Lawrence River below Montreal. In
this connection it is to be pointed out that
adequate discharging facilities have been pro-

vided in both the Crysler Island and the Barinhart Island dams to ensure the above protection
to navigation irrespeetive of what action nay be
taken with respect to control or eurtailment of
flow on the United States side of the boundary.
7. Canada bas ensured that the rigluts of
navigation accorded under existing treaties upon

the subjects or citizens and upon the ships,
vessels and boats of each of the Higli Contracting Parties in the St. Lawrence River and
in the Great Lakes System, including the canals
now existing or which may hereafter be constructed, shal be maintained and has ensured
that all British shipping shall bave such rights.
S. The treaty provides for a double stage
project, with the concentration of a head of
some 25 feet at Crysler Island and a hîead of
some 60 feet at Barnhart Island. As compared with a single stage development this
method of development means materially less
flooding to Canadian farin lands and historie

sites,

and

will

also

materially

reduce

the

height of the enbankments and dams required
in connection with the Barnhart development
the greater safe-guarding of downstream
-to
interests.
Financial:
9. Canada bas secured the completion of the

Deep Waterway Project at an estimated capital
charge to the Canadian public of less than
$40,000,000, not including interest during construction.
Note.-These figures are based upon the estimates of the Joint Board of Engineers

appointed by the Governments of Canada and
the United States to investigate and report
upon the waterway project. In the International Rapide Reach the estimates have beer
further supported by what has been termed the

Conference Report of the Dominion and Ontario
Engineers, submitted to the Dominion Gov-

FEBRUARY 1, 1934,
ernrnent on December 30, 1929. The estimates
:tïre, therefore, founded upon exhaustive field
investigations and may be said te represent the
cuinbined judgment of outstanding engineers of
the Dominion and the United States on the oe
haud and of the Dominion and Ontarjo on the
other. The egti-mates are based upen -unit coste
ds.ter.mined as of the year 1926.
10. This capital expenditure of lems than
$10,000,000, f alling upon the Dominion Treasury.
will be distriibuted over a construction period
of from seven to ten years and cannot be considered
an oppressive burden
upon
the
shouidere of Canadian taxpayers, having in
mind the immense be-nefits accruing to the
Dominion frein the construction of the Deep
Waterway.
il. The river works in the International Section of the 'St. Lawrence River will be constructed hy an International Commission, upon
which Canada and bhe United States wjll have
equal representation, out of fundg provided by
the United States. The part of these works
looated on the Canadian side of the International Boundary will be conetructed by
Canadian engineers, Canadian labour and with
Canadian materials. (This involves tihe expenditure of seime $55,000,000.)
12. In the International Section, Canada will
construet independently of the United States
the navigation works at Crysler Island, tegeth-er with ail rehabilitation works on the
Canadian side. (Theoe are estisnated to total
te $17.394,000.)
13. Canada will construct the works in the
National Section of the St. Lawrence, i.e. the
portion lying within the Province of Quebec,
with Oanadian funds and whol'ly independent
of United States co-op2ration or supervision.
(The cost of the navigation works in Quebec
are estimated ae, totalling $82,954,000.)
14. Considered upon the basis of unemployment relief, the ratification o-f t'he St. Lawrence Deep Waterway Treaty---bringing into
effect as it will the Dominion-Ontario St. Lawrance Agreement-will initiate the following
expenditures, in Canada:Cash Payment by Ontarioe.... ... $ 67,202,500

Power:
15. The treaty establishes Canada's unquestioned right to one-haîf of the total flow available for power purposes in the International
Reach of the St. Lawrence River.
16. The Canadian power houss at
Crysler
Island and et Barnhardt Island are looated in
Canadian territory and the United States
power houses in United Otates territory, s0 that
ne adjustment of the international boundary is
necessary.
17. Canada bas reached under the trea-ty
complete agreement with the United States for
the development of power on the International
Reach cf the St. Lawrence River-one-haîf of
the power to be wholly Canadien and developed
in Canadian power houses on Canadian terri742"14

19. With respect te the 3,000,000 hersepower on the St. Lawrence in the Province of
Quebec, this will be available f or development

navigation.
20. In conjunction with the St. Lawrence
Waterway there will be ultimately developed
seime 5,000,000 horse-power cf low priced electrical energy cf which sorne 4,000,000 hersepower is the property cf Canada.
This
immense block of low priced power, on one
hand directly connected with the markets of
the world through ecenomie ocean navigation;
and on the other hand directly cennected with
the immense remources cf mine, forest and land
of the Dominion through the 1,000 mile deep
water navigation of the inland seas; and
located astride the St. Lawrence and the
tributary commerce, cutgeing and ingeing, cf a
population cf soine 50,000,000; offers an epportunity for industrial and commercial development which cannot bie equalled elsewhere. The
St. Lawrence Valley is destined te become oe
of the great industrial centres cf the world.
Welland Canal:
21. By providing for the empletien cf the
St. Lawrence Deep Waterway, Canada may be
said te bring into productive use the capital
investment in the New Welland Ship Canal.
The capital cost cf the New Welland Slip
Canal te date is $128,000,000. It provides for
25 foot navigation throuirh the canal rearhas

SÈNATE

and 30 foot over the sills of the locks. The
immediate effect of the construction of this
canal bas been to carry the deep water navigation as it as present exists in the upper lakes
(18 to 20 feet) through to Lake Ontario to
the strategic advantage of the United States
The United
ports of Oswego and Albany.
States is proceeding with a program of deepening the upper lake channels for 24 to 26 foot
navigation and bas completed the deepening
of the Hudson River channel from Albany to
the sea to 27 feet.
Until such time as the St. Lawrence Deer
Waterway proviles deep water communication
front Lake Ontario to tidewater. the capital
expenditure on the New Welland Ship Canal
is not realizing the purpose for wlich it was
incurred.
The transportation benefits accruing from its construction are being directed to
United States channels.
The New Welland Ship Canal will not develop
its usefulness to the Dominion until the Deep
Waterway bas been conpleted to the sea.
Chicago Diversion:
22. Canada bas secured a satisfactory solution
to the Chicago diversion controversy-one of
the most outstanding and contentious problems
that in recent years 'have confronted the Governments of Canada and the United States. To
properly evaluate the solution which bas been
reached it is necessary to remember that the
Chicago diversion bas been in excess of 4,000
cubie feet per second for the past thirty years,
reaching a maximum of 9,465 cubic feet per
second in 1924 and still flowing at the rate of
8,180 cubic feet per second during the past
year.
The solution reached is considered as
constituting a settlement which is reasonably
fair to all the conflicting interests concerned,
and one which secures to Canada safeguards as
to the future, as well as substantial contingent
benefits as reviewed hereunder.
23. Canada bas in the first place gained a
definite international commitment to reduce the
abstraction by Deceiber 31, 1938, to the
quantity permitted as of that date by the decree
of the Supreme Court of the United States of
April 21, 1930, i.e. to 1,500 cubic feet per
second, plus the water for domestic purposes.
This limit can only be increased as an eniergency
measure approved as such by the United States
Supreme Court and concurred in by Canada.
Failing such
concurrence by Canada, the
emergency proposal nust be referred te an
international arbitral tribunal which-if it permits the energency diversion-is te stipulate
such compensatory provisions as it may deeni
just and equitable.
Ultimately the abstraction must be returned
to the amount provided for in the United States
Supreme Court Decree.
24. An outstanding gain to Canada lies in
the fact that for the first time the Chicago
abstraction bas been brought within the scope
of an international agreement which is cleareut in its ternis and recognized as such by the
t
wo High Contracting Parties.
25. A further outstanding gain te Canada is
that for the first time in the long history of
treaty negoti-ation between Canada and United
States, the United States agrees to place the
abstraction of water from Lake Michigan under
,nternational control.
26. Canada bas gained a further point of
cardinal importance in that the United States

lon. Mr. TANNER.

bas agreed that hereafter there shall be no
abstraction from the Great Lakes System to
another waterslied except by authorization of
the International Joint Commission. This constitutes a perpetual safeguard to all interests
(power, navigation and foreshore interests)
dependent upon or interested in the waters of
It also safeguards
the Great Lakes System.
those wholly Canadian interests depending upon
or affected by the St. Lawrence waters in the
Province of Quebec.
27. A further feature of exceptional import
lies in the fact that Canada lias gained the
definite acknowledgment of the United States
to Canada's continued proprietary ownership
all down the International Reach of the Great
Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, of 4,000
eubic feet per second of water that can be
economically diverted from the Ogoki River
into Lake Nipigon and thence into Lake

than balances the ultimate abstraction provided
for at Chicago, and, in conjunction with the
restrictions placed upon the withdrawal at
Chicago, will restore the w.ater levels of the

Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River to
the sea to their natural range, with all the
inherent advantages to navigation which this

implies.
2ý8. Furthermore, this provision re the Ogoki
diversion into the Great Lakes Systemt provides
for the following power advantage te Canada
(power is estimated as firm power at 90 per
cent efficiency with 60 per cent load factor):
(a) This will inake available to
Canada on the international
reaches of the St. Mary,
Niagara, and St. Lawrence
rivers, without any further

520,400 h.p.

73,300 h.p.

29. As a part of the Chicago diversion settlement, Canada bas arranged for the construction
of compensation works for the restoration of
the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence levels to
conîpensate for all lowering caused by the
abstraction of water by Chicago or for the
disturbance of the levels owing to any other
interference with the natural outflow or inflow,
frot or into, the Great Lakes System. This
provision will perpetually protect the navigation interests througbout the Great Lakes-St.
Lawrence System.
30. As a final safeguard it bas been arranged
that Canada will be supplied officially by the
United States Government with systematie
records of the waters abstracted through the
Chicago Diversion Canal. This is part of a
mutual provision whereby all waters abstracted
from or added to the Great Lakes System shall
be officially recorded by the Government within whose jurisdiction the abstraction or addition is made, and the records mutually interchanged.
General:
31. The Deep Waterway will provide access
to the sea to a population of soute 40,000,000
occupying twenty-one or more of the inland

FEBRUÂRY 1, 1934
states of the United States. The ineorning and
outgoing commerce of this vast territory wiIi
to sorne extent be diverted frein present United
States channels te the Canadian channel of the
St. Lawrence. This diversion cannot fait to
bie productive of materiai advantages to the
Canadian territory adjacent to the St. Lawrence.
particuiarly in respect to the transshipment
of lake to ocean traffic and vice versa.
32. By afferding navigation f acilities to large
deep draft vessels, particularly in the Uppei
Lakes-the cheapest formn of transportation ever
devised by mankind-the Waterway will effect
a marked saving in the cost of the shipment
of wheat and other grains, of coal, of lumber,
and cf other bulk commodities, ail so profoundly important to Canada's present and
future trade.
33. in proceeding with the Deep Waterway.
Canada is but foilowing an old tradition and
policy, originally established in 1700 and cousistently pursued for more than 230 years by
ail goveruments and parties. In the year 1700
Dollier de Casgon commenced building the first
Lachine canal, which had a depth of i fet
The depths o'f these canale, have grown-li fe,
2J feet, then 5 feet, then 9 feet, then 14 feet
and now 27 feet.
34. Canada is founded upon and owes hier
national existence and hier political îndependence to east and west transportation. The
Waterway by cheapening this basic east and
west inovement for a distance of 2,200 miles
canuot but contribute te national prosperity and
independence.
35. To Bjritish Columbia the Waterway will
bring larger Canadian markets in Ontario, whiie
to the Prairie Provinces it provides decreased
ùost in tbe movement of grain. To Ontario and
Quehec there cornes the conjunetion of deep
waterway shippiug facilities and vast power
resources, with ail the industrial consequences
which must flow from such an unique circumstance. To the Maritimes the Waterway brings
a new and niarked increase in the availabiiity
of the Ontario markets. The St. Lawrence
Systemn wiIl stabilize and make more certain
Canada's competitive expert position and will
ceduce the cost cf inmporta. It wili confer abunlant power on the citizens of the St. Lawrence
basin and will thus create a highly industrialized developmient. In addition to the direct
benefits thus clearly foreseen there will be a
whole range cf indirect benefits which must
enure te Canada.
36. Finally, because it will cheapen basic
east and weet transportation, the Waterway
will make a substantial contribution to the
early attainrnent and permanent enjoyrnent cf
a goal profoundly desired by aIl Canadiansa national if e that will be politîcally free because economically sound.
Larn going te suppiement that with another
memorandum, dealing with an article which
I read ini Halifax, by iMr. F. J. D. Barnium,
who makes a very vigorous onslaught on the
waterway. Ris principal ground is that by
the time it is completed there wili net be
sufficient water te float the ships, and tfiat
tbe flow of the St. Lawrence River wiil be
decreased by reason cf increased evaporation.
I communicated with the proper branch of

53

the Department cf Raiiways, sending them
this article, and asked them te give me their
vjews on it. I have them here. Tlie honourable senator fromn Hamilton (Hou. Mr.
Lyn.ch-Staunton) discussed in part something
that was said about the levels. 1 arn geing
te band this memorandum, also to the reporter, if there is no objection. -I will just
mention that it points eut that records of
leveis ever eue buudred years ago show that
they were lower than those existing in 1925,
and that cycles cf high aud of low leveis
have followed. This aise has been borne out
since 192, as the levels of ail the Great
Lakes in 19M reached a point fromn four te
five feet above that cf the minimum during
the low-water period.
The statement deais also with the question
of evaporation, and points eut that there
could be nothing of any consequeuce in that,
because the existing surface is 95,190 square
miles and with the construction cf the proposed dams it would bie increased. te the
tri*fling extent cf only i2ý square miles.
Thein there is a statement in regard te the
Oswego and Hudson route, which 1 arn sure
henourable members cf the House will find
very interesting. If there is ne objection, te
shorten proceedings-Right Bon. Mr. GRAHAIM: Wouid yeu
mind reading the part cf it referring te the
Oswege and Hudson canal?
Heun. Mr. TANNER: I shall be ver>' glad
te de se.
Thle United States can buiid a deep waterway
fromn the foot of Lake Ontario at Oswego te
Albany, on the Hudson River, without reference te auy international body, as the water
supply for sucb a canal ean, be obtained lecally.
The deepening of the Huidson River ulpte
Albany was cornpieted this year te a depth of
27 feetThis was written ever a year age.
-and the compietion of the Welland Ship
Canal by Canada means that the gap between
Oswego and Albany is the oniy portien remaining to be compieted te previde a deep waterway
for the United States froin the middle west
te the sea. This route wouid be open for at
ieast one month each year longer than Montreai1, and with rates cheaper eut cf New York
than eut of Montreai, might provide cheaper
transportation than the St. Lawrence route.
This prejeet has been etudied by U.S. Army
engineers and they have reported that the
benefits aecruing therefrom would more than
balance the carrying charges. Action on this
project has been with-held, however pending
n tiations with Canada ou the St. Lèwrence.
ejheeie ne doubt that the aJi-Anerican
route, if buiit, would be a very serions threat
te the St. Lawrence route.
The memorandum then refera te Mr. MeLachian's evidence before the Senate Cern-

mittee, giving the pages.

54

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAiM: That is all I
want.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: The previous part of
the memorandum refers to the United States
being able to draw on supplies of water which
are not international. It says:
It should also be noted that the proposed
treaty, for the first tine in history, places the
abstraction of water from Lake Michigan
througb the Chicago Drainage Canal under
international control and prevents any further
abstractions of water from the Great Lakes
Systemi te another watershed except by
authority of the International Joint Commission.
That, honourable gentlemen, is really all
I wish to say to the House. My only hope
is that the information whici I have gathered
up for rny own benefit may be of some service to honourable mîembers.
Following are the memuoranda submitted by
Hon. Mr. Tanner:
1. Lowering of Water Levels.
In

1925, independent

studies were

made in

this office, and by the U.S. Lake Survey, in
order to determine the cause of the lowered
lake levels as existing at that timue. as coinpared with the higher levels of previous years.
This study was confined to the levels of Lakes
Huron, Michigan and Erie.
The conclusions

arrived at as a resuilt of these two independent
studies vere practically the same. About 40
per cent of the lowering of lake levels was due
to deflcicncy of rainfall. but the conclusion
arrived et w as that this wvas not of a perissanent nature and that iicreased precipitation
woould follow withb consequent raised levels.
Records show that the levels over a hundred

years ago were lower than those existing in
1925, and that cycles of high and low levels
had followed. This bas been borne out since
1925, as the levels of all the Great Lakes in
1929 reached a level of from 4 to 5 feet above
that of the minimum during the low-water
period.
The propesed improvement of the International Section of the St. Lawrence necessitates
the regulation of the outflow of Lake Ontario.
The Joint Board of Engineers derived a rule
curve for this regulation and tested its reliability by its application to conditions as
existing over the period from 1860 to date.
Such a regulation does not contemplate increasing the natural outflow in the aggregate,
but will conserve water during periods of high)
levels in order to increase the flow during
periods cf low levels.
The contention that increased evaporation
due to increased pond areas vill have any effect
on the flow in the St. Lawrence River can best
be answered by a glance at the following table:
Existing surface areas of the
Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River to proposed site
of low er dans and power

International control and prevents any further

abstractions of water from

the Great Lakes

System to another watershed except by authority of the International Joint Commission.
2. ('anadian and United States Canals in International Rapids Section.
In order for Canada to build a canal entirely
on the Canadian side of the International
Boundary through the International Rapide

Section of the St. Lawrence River, permission
vould first have te be obtained from the
International Joint Commission for the diversion of sufficient water froîn the river to supply
lockage.
Such a project. if built, would not
provide for the development of any power and
instead of river and lake navigation. would
suKbstitute about 45 miles of narrow canal. The
estimated total cost to the Federal Government
of the waterway frons Lake Ontario te Montreal by substituting such a project in thle
International Section would be increased from
about $40,000.000 as estinated under the proposed treaty and Ontario agreement te about
$195,000,000.
The facilities provided by such a project
would be available for use by United States
shipping on the sase basis as the present canal
systems.
Tlhe United States ean build a deep waterway fron the foot of Lake Ontario at Osvego
to Albany on the Hudson River withoit refer-

ence to any international body. as the water
supply for such a canal can be obtained locally.

The deepening of the Hudson River up to
Albany was completed this year to a depth of
27 ft. and the completion of the Welland Ship
Canal by Canada means tbat the gap between
Oswego and Albany is the only portion remaining to he completed to provide a deep waterwav
for the United States froin the maiddle west

te the sea.

This route would be open for at

least one mon-th each year longer than Montreal
and with rates cheaper ont of New York than
out of Montreal. might provide cheaper transportation than the St. Lawrence route. This
project bas been studied by U. S. Armuy engineers and they have reported that the benefits

accruing therefrom wiould more than balance the
carrying charges. Action on this project bas
been withheld however, pending negotiations

with Canada on the St. Lawrence.
There is no doubt that the all-American
route, if built, woild be a very serions threat
to the St. Lawrence route.
(Sec aIso Mr. McLachlan's evidence before
the Senate Committee, 192 8-page xxxix).

re

Water

Supply

for

Al-American

Waterway, Oswego-Hudson Route.
The Deep Waterways Board of the United
States presented two solutions of the above
problem in their report of 1900.
These two plans for water supply were called
respectively the "high-level"
and the "lowlevel" plans and were both based on obtaining
the requisite wa.ter supply for operation of the
proposed canal from sources other than diverting water from any international river, althougb both plans contemplated taking some
water from rivers tributary te Lake Ontario.
Under date of February 25, 1926, a Board
of Engineers of the U. S. Corps of Engineers

Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable members of the Senate, it was not my intention to
participate in this debate untit yesterday,
when I heard the bonourable the leader on
the other side of the flouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) make reference to mixed farming in
Western Canada. I do nut pose as an expert,
but farming bas been a hobby of mine for a
years-an
expensive
hobby,
number
of
perhaps, but nevertbeless a very interesting
one. Tberefore, if I arn able now or at any
other time to throw any tight on tbe subject
or to give any information to honourable
members of this assembly, 1 shail be onity too
gtad to do so.
In rising to address this august assembty
I do so with a great deat of trepidation; but
the friendty atmospbere which prevaits tends
courage for the task. As I bave nothing of
a controversial nature to deal with, I arn sure
that I shall receive a very patient hearing.
As you may atready know, I come from. the
great west-centrat wheat.-producing plains of
the province of Saskatchewan. In that part
of the wonld we flot only eat wbeat, but think,
talk and dream of atmost nothing etse. Wheat
is spoken of on the street corners, in the banks
and in the offices, and atwayq tbe price of
wbeat is of paramount importance to us in
that part of Saskatchewan. As a matter of
fact, the whote economic tife of the country
there depends upon the yield of wheat and
the price to be ohtained for it ini the mnarkets
of the world.
While 1 think of it, I should like to tbank
the members of the Senate for the very kind
and hospitabte reception wbich my friend the
bonourable senator from Northern Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Horner) and I bave
received at the hands of this flouse. We
hope to be able to repay your kind hospitality
at some time wben you visit Saskatchewan.
We shatt be onily too glad to take you att
over the country and show you oome of the
most reniarkable wheat-growiiig p.ains in the
-whote world.
I think atso that at this time I shtuld congratulate the moyer (Hon. Mr. Hocken) and
the seconder (Hon. Mn. Fauteux) of the

55

Address, the right honourabte the leader of
this assembly (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and the othen honourable gentlemen
who have spoken during the last few days.
The tone of the addresses bas been of the
highest, and I may say that I have been
agneeabty surprised to find that there has flot
been the teast sign of politicat rancour.
Honourabte members of this assembty who
have not travelled extensivety ini the western
part of Canada are probabty unaware of the
immensity of that country, and of the fact
that in the area of which I amn about to speak
mixed farming on any targe scate is pnacticalty
an impossibility. The Rosetown district is
-located one bundred miles southwest of
Saskatoon, one hundred mites south of North
Batiteford, one bundred mites east of the
Alberta boundary, and one bundred miles from
Swift Current, on the C.P.R. soutbern main
tine. To give you some idea of the magnitude
of the country, I may tetl you that in the
sevenal rural municipatities contiguous to
Rosetown there are 1,500,000 acres of farm
lands. I think I arn safe in saying atso that
at least a million acres are under cuttivation,
and that appnoximatety 750,000 acres are sown
to wheat each year. Tbe reason why this land
is not adaptable to, mixed farming is simply
this: the surface water supply is poor, the
waten being obtained from. deep welts and a
dam bere and tbere. The soit is a heavy,
very deep dlay gumbo with a top surface of
what we caît loose-top. Now, when this loosetop land is broken up from the sod, the grass
is entirety destroyed, and we flnd it atmost
impossible to obtain Jater a good catch of
grass, on account of the tack of rainfaît. As
a resuit, we are obliged to grow mostly wheat
in that area. I witt admit that the growing
of one crop like wbeat is a very risky business.
But wbat are we to do? If the whote of
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta went in
for nîixed farming and pnoduced grain for
feeding hogs, cattle, poultny and other tive
stock, our total products in those lines would
be so large that there would not be a market
for themn anywhere in the wontd, and the
prices would fwli to zero.
I have in my hand a oopy of an article
whieh appeared as an advertisement of a
cold storage eompany, which advocated the
abandoment by -the farmers of wbest growing and the substitution of mixed farming.
Perhaps it is interesting enough to, justify my
reading it at this time.
Wheat, it appears, is a seed that le planted
and grown to kceep the producer broke and the
buyer crazy.: It is planted in the spring,
morýtgaged in the summer and tost in the f att.
Its qu.ality varies according to the amount of

56

SENATE

rain or frost experienced during the growing
season. A man who can guess nearest to this
quality is called a wheat grader by the public
and a gosh darn fool by the farmer.
The price of wheat is deterinined at primary
markets and goes down when one has bought
and up when one has sold.
All this reminds us of the story of the buyer,
who, working for a group of millers from the
East, came West to watch the wheat market.
After a few days of deliberation he wired his
principals to this effect:
"Some think wheat will go down, and some
think it will go up. I think so too. Whatever
you do will be wrong. Act at once."
The advertisement concludes by advising
farmers to go into mixed farming and store
their products with the cold storage company. That perhaps is as good an advertisement for mixed farming as the, honourable
leader on the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) could possibly find anywhere. In the
West we all agree that the growing of one
crop is risky.
I should like to say that the wheat farmer
can make himself self-sustaining on his wheat
farm.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It is not so long
ago, however, that the wheat farmer was not
self-sustaining. I know for a fact, from my
own observation, that in our district many
farmers did not even have a garden; they
had no horses, cows nor chickens; they produced nothing that they could eat or sell,
other than wheat. All the work was donc
with a tractor, and all the goods required
were obtained from town, the store bill being
paid at the end of the year, after the wheat
crop was sold. They were able to work so
efficiently with the tractor that a great many
farmers thought it more profitable to grow
wheat exclusively, buy all the goods they
needed in town, and not be bothered with
mixed farming. And for many years they
were very successful. They sold their wheat
in the fall, paid their store and gasoline
bills, and then either settled down for the
winter or went to Eastern Canada and spent
the rest of their money. In the spring they
came back to Saskatchewan and borrowed
enough money from the bank to put the
crop in. This process continued from year
to year. So efficiently was this method of
farming carried on for a number of years
that a man with a tractor and up-to-date
farm machinery could farm a whole section
and a quarter of land, that is 800 acres, by
himself, with only the help of a men for a
few days in the spring and fall. In the whole
year such a farmer worked only fifty-five
days, and yet he was making money.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

But that is no longer true. Commencing
about 1929, when we felt the first effects of
the depression, the farmer in the wheat growing areas bas been endeavouring to make himself self-sustaining, and be now bas his cows,
horses, hogs and chickens, and an animal or
two to kill for beef. He feeds these a limited
amount of grain and bas not only enough
live stock and farm produce for his own personal use, but some to sell in the surrounding
towns as a means of helping to pay part of his
grocery bill. Whereas a few years ago his
grocery bill used to run from $1,200 to $2,000,
it is now considerably reduced, but still be
cannot raise enough live stock and farm produce to pay all his expenses, and since 1930
lie bas been gradually losing ground, for
reasons which I shall mention later on.
During the boom years from 1925 to 192,
inclusive, we in Saskatchewan were invaded
by high pressure salesmen from the East and
West. Our farmers, instead of paying off their
inortgages, as they should have done when
crops were good and prices high, bought at the
instance of these high pressure salesmen all
sorts of things, automobiles, tractors and farm
trucks by the hundreds, pianos and radios, and
not the ordinary kind, but expensive models.
In the spring of 1927 a whole train-load of
tractors was shipped to our town for one local
implement dealer. I do not know how long
that train was, but it looked to be about a
mile. And every one of those tractors was
disposed of. When you consider that that
shipment was for only one dealer, that other
dealers imported tractors by the car-load, and
that for several years the annual sales of automobiles exceeded $1,000,000, you will not be
surprised to learn that the mortgages were
not paid off during that time, and that these
luxuries were gradually repossessed by the
firms that had not received payment in full
for them, and that the farmer is therefore in
a bad position financially.
I submit ,that the farmer is not altogether
to blame. He was simply doing what other
people were doing. I should say that fifty per
cent of the cost of those things was paid in
cash, the balance being financed through large.
financial concerns in this country on conditional sale agreements, with interest at the
paitry rate of twelve per cent. And, as I said
before, during the years 1931 to 1933 the
farmer lost practically all those articles which
be had not paid for in full.
I should like to say a little about interest
rates. The farmers of Western Canada have
paid hundreds of millions of dollars in interest, and they are still paying at high rates
to the best of their ability. Farm loans have

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
been running from eight to ten per cent on
first-class mortgages, the machinery notes
were at nine per cent, tbe bank loans froxu eight
to ten per cent, and the conditional. sale agreements mostly at twelve per cent. The batiks,
in my opinion, are not altogether blameless
for somns tbings that bave bappened. Wben
money was free, some fifteen years ago, tbey
lent large sums. In fact, local managers were
persuading farmers to borrow big amounts.
I know of one particular case-and there
are many others of the samne kind-where a
farmer borrowed $7,000 about that time. 'He
agreed to pay eight per cent interest. His
crop was light that year, and when bie went
back in the faîl to pay a small amount on
account of principal and give a new note for
the balance the bank manager demanded nine
per cent interest. Tbe farmer bad to pay
that, because be was threatened with suit.
He had a lot of property, land and chattels,
and be naturally signed the new note at nine
per cent. Tbe notes are usually for three
months; so that four timeg a year this farmer
would go back to the bank, pay something
on account of principal if be could,' and give
a new note f or tbe balance. As the notes
were always discounted when made, the interest was paid ini advance at the rate of
nine per cent. That farmer bas not paid back
aIl tlie principal yet, although the total of
Ibis interest and principal payment is from
815,000 to 820,000. 1 have not the exact
figure bere, but the papers in connection
with the case are on file now with tbe Debt
.41djustment Bureau in Regina, wbere they
are under consideration with a view to seeing
if it is not possible to have some adjustment
made. The amount be owes the bank at
present is $500, and they are holding all bis
land and chattels as security for this smal
balance, refusing to release any of it. Ahl
this bas been goi.ng on in spite of the fact
that our federal Bank Act provides the rate
of interest shahl not exceed seven per cent.
0f course, we ail know that if a man agrees,
ts this farmer did, to pay eigbt or nine per
cent, even if the agreement is made under
stress, and the notes are discounted, he bas
no legal remedy.
I arn afraid that 1 arn painting a rather
gà,oomy picture for honourable members, but
1 shiould like to say tha-t, thaînks to the Relief
Commission of Saskatchewan and to our
rede, al and provincial governments, there is
no one to my knowledge stsrving in Western
Caýnada. Some of our people in the driedout areas, where there have been crop failures
for five successive years. have had to, tighten
their beâts, but they ail have enough t e at,
t.hey have been furnished with a reaso-nable

57

amount of clothing and with coal, and under
the circumstances are not doing too badly.
In ýfact, Vhey are holding out wonderfully well
and complaining but very littie.
I also wan-t to say that the country which
1 have been speaking about, around Rosetowii,
is flot in the dried-out area. The farmers
there have hiad only four crop failures in
thirty years from drought,-one ini 1910, one
in 1914, one in 1924, and the lsast one in 1933.
But while we have had only four crop failures
through drought, in 1930 we Iost practically
ail our crop as a resuit of soil drifting; and
that applied flot only to the Rosetown area,
but t-o the southern part of Saskatchewan as
welýl. The samne thing happened ini 1931, but
I arn glad to say that ail the relief that ws
furniishcd in our district, after what crop we
had was harveetcd, bas been paid back with
the exception of some $2,000. In 1932 we
had a fair crop, but the prioe was only 25
cents a bushel.
Last year there was the biggest failure of
ail, because practical-ly no crop was produced
on a strip about four hundred miles wide
extending practically from the North Saskatchewan, river, in Alberta and Saskatchewan,
south through Saskatchewan into the United
States and almost as far sou.th as the Gulf
of Mexico. In many parts of that area the
binders were flot taken out-t-he ýcrop was
flot high enough to be -eut wi-th a mnower. This
followed the othei, years of soit drifting, a.nd
as we had no ra.in we were hel'pless. We
had always thought that on account of the
heavy soit in that district we could grow a
crop with. one rain, and perbaps with no main
at ahl, bu-t we oouid not avoid a coxuplete
crop failure when we bad the cumulative
effects of the other conditions to contend
with. Not even enough crop for seed was
grown in the area. extending almost from, the
town of Rosetown to the city of Saskatoon,
100 miles to the east, and almost as far west
as Druinheller and Calgary.
As a resuit of those conditions mortgage
interest bas been piling up, and is from two
to four years in arrears, in many cases amounting to haîf as much as the principal. The
taxes also are far behind, and store buis are
unpaid. Peinhaps I migbt be permitted to
refer by way of illustration to my experience
on one farm. of my own. I have a farm of
eight hundred acres, nine miles south of the
town of Rosetown. It is ahl under cultivation,
and we have adopted the metbod of strip
farming to prevent the drifting of soil. That
is, instead of .baving one huge field aI summerfallowed, we break it up into smaller fields
of twenty to f orty acres, ploughed and worked

5S

SENATE

at riglit angles to the prevailing wind, which
in our district is the west wind; and we put
one strip in crop, leave the next strip, put the
next strip in crop, leax e the next one, and
so on ail down the field. In that way we
have a field of, let us say. only twenty rods
wvide, to blow, and the drift therefore does not
accumulate to the same extent as it would
if there were a field a mile wide for the west
wvind to play havoc with. In this way we
have practically prevented the soil drifting.
In 1933 wo planted four hundred acres in
wheat on this farmn and harvested four hun(lred lyushels. It took hiaîf of the total receipts
to pay the cost of combining the crop, and
the other haîf is ail that romains for the man
on the farm to live on until next faîl.
Furthermore, there is ne seed, and that has
to ho purchased. in the spring.
This condition prevails in that part of the
country. It prex ails also in the southwestern
part of the province to a greater degree, as
mentiooed by the hionourable member from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) this afternoon.
I agree with hima that tlie proper thiing to do
is te move the settlers thero into the north,
ývhere thiere is a greater rainfail and tbey
(an make a gond home for themnselves on
C.P.R. or Hudson Bay lands, or on homesteads whichi they cao purchiase from the Goveroment at one dollar an acre.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has not that
transfer been in operation for some vcars
past?

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes, it lias been
iinder way for two years. I do not know how
many families have been moved from that
particular district, but from urban centres
and from any area where the rural municipal
councils certify the land is flot fit for wheat
or any other kind of farming now being
carried on, the Government is moving the
people north, two-thirds of the cost being
paid by it and one-third by the municipality.
If the abandoned land is worth anything at
ail it is taken over by the Dcpartment of
Naturai Resources.
Probably it would be
easy to use the land again for grazinig purposes, for sandy soul xvii grow grass in gond
years-something which cannot be done on
heavy dlay gumbo. I might add that even
on the heavy soil of which I have heen speaking you can always grow oats on summerfallowed land, but flot enough for feed. One
reason why we, cannot successfully mix-farm.
on sncb land is that if we do not grow a
crop of wheat the forage crop is also a failuire. We might stock up with cattle, horses
and hogs, and have no feed for them. In this
event we should be obliged either to give
them away or to ship thema into the north,
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

and then next year start ail over again. 1
think the oni way to circumvent this state
of affairs is to build up a supply of fecd in
gond years to carry us over the Jean years.
That is what is heing done at the present
timie.
At this stage I sbould like to pay a tribute
to the Minister of Agriculture for the Domninion, lion. Mr. WVeir, for the great work hie
lias heen (bing on behiaîf of agriculture. He is
ot only a practical farmer and stock man,
but a man of high eduicational attainiments,
and lie is using bis practical experience and
bis talents, working nighit and day, in the
interests of the farmer. In the Wcst wc are
ail satisfied that ho is doing a great xvork.
We are also satisfied that the Empire Trade
Agreements have been quite satisfactory, for
the reasons already mentioned in this dehate.
The wheat pools are satisfied that the London Wheat Agreement is a gond measure. We
are flot anticipating any difficulty at ail in
regard to the reduction of acreage. I will
tell you why: the grasshopper menace is upon
us. W/e had nover hoco bothered wvith this
pest bof ore. The grasshoppers flew i0 last
August and laid their eggs, infesting the
greater part of the three Prairie Provinces
from the international border to as far north
as Township 33, pcrhaps n little fartier. This
takos in perhaps more than fifty per cent of
the cultivnted land of these provinces.
Al
over that area, on roadsidcs and in stubble
fields, the grnsshoppers have depositcd anywbere from. flfteen to fifty eggs per square
foot. We are told by university professors
and Government officiais that those eggs will
hatchi out in the spring. For instance, if yoiî
put a flower-pot full of gardon soul on your
kitchen shoîfs, you will find that as soon as
the temperature reaches seventy degrees the
eggs start to hatch out. That bas actually
taken place.
Now, why is the grasshopper menace going
to reduce the wheat acreage? We are advised
to sow nothing- but summer fallow in that
wholo area. Appýroximately one-third of the
land is sumamer fallow, and the other twothirds stuhhle. If we follow this advice, we
shaJ1 reduce the acreage in wheat much more
than flfteen per cent. So 1 am quite sure the
Governîment will have no trouble at ail in
reduicing the wheat acreage. There must also
ho taken into accounit the land which will not
ho sown to wheat, it having been found unsuited for the purpose.
Instead of a reduction of acreage I would
advocate a quota. Lot the farmer grow ail
the wheat ho wants to, but fix the amoîînt he
niay take to market. Thon if ho grows 10,000
bushels in 1934, and his quota is 8,000 bushels,

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
he will have 2,000 bushels to, put into his
granary and carry over to next year. If in
1935 he has a short crop or a crop failure,
he will have feed and seed to carry him on.
in other words, this policy would he]p build
up that surplus to which I have referred and
which I think it is advisab-le for every farmer
to have on hand.
I do flot intend to discuss the wheat situation. It is very discouraging. I could ýtalk
on the situation in Germany, in France, in
Italy, in Spain, and show that we should like
to have those countries enter into agreements
with us for the purpose of supplying them
wjth wheat at flot more than a dollar a bushel
and se on. Perhaps on some other occasion I
shall deal with the subject.
In spite of the discouraging picture I have
drawn, I feel qi'ite safe in saying that if the
Western farmer can get even seventy-five
ents a bushel fjoib. at point of delivery for bis
xvheat, while he may not be able to pay ail his
debts, he will be able to pay his way for the
time being, and gradually reduce bis indebtedness. But I do not see how he can ever get
rid of the burden of interest that has been
bearing him down and grinding him into the
dust ýduring the last five or six years. I
submit there will have to be a comprehensive
scheme of dëbt adjusgtment for the purpose at
least of getting rid of that interest and perhaps cutting the principal as well. But I
want the House to understand that I arn
flot in favour of debt cancellation. Exccpt
the few who have joined some new party
or other. I do flot thiuk any of the farmers in
Western Canada are in favour of cancellation.
Debt adjustment always, total cancellation
never-that is my principle.
With regard to farmn mortgages, I may say
that Professor W. Allen, of the University of
Saskatchewan, has prepared a pamphlet showing that in Saskatchewan there are $175,000,000
worth of farm mortgages and $600,000,000
worth of agreements of sale, the total debt
of the farmers being about a billion dollars.
The total mortgage debt for the three Prairie
Provinces is about $300,000,000.
Now, if a great holding company could ha
f ormed to take over all these mortgages, I
think it would be a good thing. There should
be> a board in each province. The mortgages
should be reduced to not more than fifty per
cent of the present value of the land; that
is, there would be an adjustment to that extent. The company should then issue bonds
at four per cent. Until such time as the
national debt or the bond issue of the Dominion is rewritten and interest reduced, perhaps
those bonds could not be sold; but I think
they could be sold if the Government would

59

guarantee their payment, and then the
mortgage companies would faîl into lina. In
that way money could ha raised for the purpose of taking over the mortgages which
would ba rawritten, extending over a long
pariod of years, with an interest charge of five
pe& cent. This would allow one per cent for
handling the money.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Should not that apply
to the whole of Canada?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I have discussed
tha matter with several bankers in Ottawa
since I came down hera. They tell me they
think the suggestion is sound in principle,
but that it should apply to the whole of
Canada. I do not know the amount of the
farm mortgage debt for the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It is $700,000,000.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I arn afraid that
would be a big undartaking.
May I say that at the present time tha
shoes of the farm people in the West are
gatting thin in the solesý, their socks are out
at heel, their clothing is gatting threadbare,
their farmn machinery and harnass are gatting
worn out, their buildings nead repair-many
of them should ha rehuilt-and have not sean
any paint for a number of years. I suggest
that if the Western farmar can get a satisfactory adjustment of his dabts, soma cheap
rnoney and a coupila of crops, and realize a
good price, he will buy from Eastern Canada
all thesa things that he needs. This would
keep the milis and manufacturing concerns
going at full blast, and bring about such prosperity in Eastern Canada as has not bean seen
for a long time, as it will take several years
to supply the people of Western Canada with
all these things of which they are in naed.
I arn confident that as soon as they have
the money their purchasing Power will mean
prosperity for the whole country, for I contend
that if the farmer is prosperous bis prosperity
willl be reflected in every part of this fair
Dominion.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourabla senators,
I had not intendad to take part in this debata,
but I feel it necassary to deal with some of
the statemants of the honourabla member from
De Lanaudière MHon. Mr. Caisgrain). I had
bean told there was very littla of politica in
this -Cham~ber, but after listening to the
honourable gentleman it seems t.o me thara is
polities in plenty. He statad that the Wheat
Pool had attempted to set the price of wheat.
This is not so. Many persons appear to
labour under this erroneous impression, and
perhaps this accounts for the attitude of those

60

SENATE

in Eastern Canada who criticize the Wheat
Pool for its action in 1929 and 1930. As a
matter of fact the Pool handled fifty-one per
cent of the wheat; in other words, at the end
of the wheat year, July 31, 1930, it had sold
13,000,000 bushels more than the grain
trade had sold of their share of the wheat
handled.
In 1930 there appeared in the press of Western Canada a letter over the signature of the
president of one of our largest chartered
banks, declaring that the Wheat Pool president, the late Mr. Macphail, was doing the
proper thing in holding wheat for $1.50 a
bushel. My honourable friend from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) says he farms
as a hobby. It has been a serious business
with me all my life, and I have had to pay
particular attention to it or I should not
have been able to raise my family. Naturally
we in the West take advice from anyone in
Eastern Canada who, we think, bas a better
grasp of world conditions than we have. I
believe that as a result of the advice contained in that letter a million dollars was
gambled on the grain exchange from the
little town where I live.
My honourable friend from De Lanaudière
bas informed us that our banking system is
perfect and that we do not need a Central
Bank. I believe we do need a Central Bank.
Certainly we need some control of credit.
At a time when cattle were selling at nine
cents a pound I, as well as other farmers,
was advised by our local bank manager to
buy a hundred head of cattle, as the bank
was desirous of lending money for the purpose. After feeding those cattle all through
the winter we had to sell them the next year
at four cents a pound. As a result many
farmers lost everything. Last fall when cattle
were selling at one cent a pound there was
no money available for the purpose of feeding them, although there were thousands of
tons of feed and any quantity of low priced
grain for sale all over the northern part of
the three Western Provinces. The honourable
senator told us that the banks were Iending
only depositors' money and therefore took no
chances; that, no matter what a man's reputation might be, they would make advances
only on absolutely secured loans. If that were
the case, there would be no such thing as a
poor loan. Then why charge more interest to
one man than to another? The poor man had
to pay from nine to ten per cent interest for
his money while the well-to-do man got his
loan at seven per cent. I submit that this is
wrong in principle.
Certain persons in Eastern Canada complain that many farmers in the West are not

Mr. HORNER.

making an effort to pay their debte. I remember that in the early days the homestead
inspector in my district, in addition to discharging his official duties, was handling
money for two mortgage companies. He called
on me, as he did on several other young men,
and pressed me to take a loan on my place.
Later on, after good years, the companies who
had money that they wished to lend hired the
best men available and were competing with
one another to place that money. Very often
they pointed out to a man that if he wished
to be progressive te ought to buy some
machinery. So the farmers were encouraged
to take loans.
In the northern part of Saskatchewan there
is room for a great number of settlers. The
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) was asking whether settlement
was going on. I believe that during the past
summer fifty thousand farmers moved from
the southern part of the province to the
northern section. I do not altogether agree
with the honourable member from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) that the whole southwest portion of the province is bad. Take
the Milestone area for instance. The people
there were on relief, but for thirty years they
had not known a erop failure. I was talking
to one man who said te had gone into that
district with $2 in his pocket, that te had
later spent nine winters in California, $55,000
had gone in bad investments, and te still owned
two sections of the finest Iand in Canada and
did not owe a dollar on it. The local member
from Milestone was complaining of the hardship there. I said: "Some of you men must
have cash. What about such and such a
man?''"
Why," he said, "he is on relief."
That district suffered severely from the drifting of the soil. It had previously been po
prosperous that the people had no more
thought of saving money than you would have
of taking a pail of water out of the Ottawa
River for fear it should go dry. They thought
that all they had to do was seed a crop and
they would have plenty of money to carry
them along.
My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) said that we had prosperity under
Liberal governments and depression under
Conservative governments. I should not like
to admit that. It may be truc. The Liberal
governments acted like a man on a rented
farm, and took advantage of the situation to
plunge the country into debt; then the Conservative governments, when they came into
power, had to pay up. We were well served
in Northern Saskatchewan by the Canadiian
National Railways, but under the Liberal

FEBRUARY 1, 1934
government the C.P.R. paralleled the Uines
already existing and built many miles of road.
Now neither road is proepering. We are
paying for that.
The honourable gentleman also objected ta
the Government going to the Old Country
for men to tell us what ta do about the banking situation in this country. I only wish
that the party he supports bad taken a similar
attitude wben they wisbed ta saecure a mnan
ta run the railroadis of this country. If they
had donc so the country woul1d have been
savcd many millions of dollars.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: When we bad

Hon- Mr. HORNER: I amn much pleased
with the ability that I find here, and the
reception that was accorded ta me upon corning here, a new senator from the farm.I
know that, as bas been said, there are men of
very great ability and experience in this
Chamber. I was vcry much taken with the
rernarks of the honourable member from
Vancouver, and should vcry rnuch like ta hear
a discussion by these able men upon several
of the points raised in bis speech. In this
connectian I might say that I was somewhat
disappointed-coming, as I do, a very long
distance-at the prospect of a long adjournment of this Chamber. I think we could
perform a useful service here. There are hefore the country at the present tirne many
great questions about whicb sornething should
be donc. If there is any littie help that I
can give, I shail be only too glad ta give it.
Hon. RUFUS POPE: Honourable gentlemen, I shahl not detain you long, whicb I arn
sure wiIl be a matter of satisfaction ta those
of you who know me best.
I listened this afternoon ta the honourable
senator fromn Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae),
who crossed the ocean, travelled over the
countries of Europe, and bas corne back and
rcported ta us that peace in the world is
not possible, and that theref are we should
feel dismal and despondent and bopeless. I
do~ nat think there is any more danger to-day
than there was in 1914; and we pulled througb
that period. Truc, wc have had ta pay for
it. Everybody bas ta pay for liberty. No

i

matter in what part of the world, no inatter
at what time in the history of the world,
liberty bas cost money and lives. Nevertheless, it has heen necessary ta the progress
and devclopment of the human race.
In the early days of Canada the kings of
France ruled and dictated through men sent
out here by them. Later England took over
the reins, and even then years passed before
we secured the liberty that we now enjoy.
The last important letter on that subject was
written, I arn happy ta say, by a residcnt of
the Eastern Townships, Sir Alexander Gait.
He wrote the letter that brought to, us freedom and constitutional. government as we
have them in Canada to-day; and if sacrifices
have to be made again in order ta guarantee
in the future the same liberty that we now
enjoy, I say that the young men of Canada
who stand behind me will make those sacrifices for Canada and for the Empire.
Coming now to international finance, let
me say that I hope we have very littie ta do
with it. I know of no international finance
that is not based on the payment of money
ta somebody. Nohody is going ta finance us
for amusement, either through a Central Bank
or in any other way. International finance
involves ail sorts of powers of conscription,
and a dogma that is unpleasant to, the ordinary independent man. Therefore I hope
we shall have none of it.
Some

people think that we should move in the
direction of rcîprocity. There is no such
thing as reciprocity unless you give the other
fellow the handie of the jug and take what
spilîs out on you. You cannot get reciprocity;
nobody ever got reciprocity on this continent.
Do you think the United States of America
are prepared, under any conditions, ta hand
Oh, no,
over ta us more than they receive?
gentlemen! Neverl You need not look in
that direction for trade; you must look ciscwhere in the worid, particularly witbin the
confines of the British Empire. There we have
friends, and there rcciprocity arrangements
already have heen made, for which nohody
deserves more credit than the present Prime
Minister of Canada, R. B. Bennett. This la
a matter, net of party politics, but of benefits
conferred upon ail parts of the Empire,
members of one family. We are ail recipro.cating, and as we learn the requirements of
the other portions of the Empire, and they
learn ours, this wonderful reciprocal arrangement will do for Canada even more than it
bas done yet-and it bas done much in the
past twclve months. Sa far as some of aur
experts are concerned, wc must deal elsewhere
than within the Empire. We are an export-

ing nation, because we possess the raw materia]s. We have big- forests and the biggest
minerai resources in the world. and wben they
are deveioped no country will be able to
compote with Canada. We should be proud
of our resources, and should have no fear of
heing swallowed up by a tremendous indobtedness. Let us look forward with confidence and hope. Nobody ev or gets anywboro
by looking backward.
If wo look forward
we shall sc the sun of the future rising to
greot us and holding forth the promise of
prosperity and happiness.
I arn sorry for the United States. They
are not a nation, but a conglomeration of
states coinposed of the off-scourings of
Europe whio came into that country as
settiers. They are neighbours of ours, and ho
would be a mean man who would imipose
bardship or misfortiine on bis neighbour.
Thorofore I arn sorry for the United States.
Ie the eariy days the UJnited States wanted
to bc able to make things more cheaply
than anybody else could make them, and
brought in negrees at se much a head, and
used themn until the introduction of steam;
then they) found they could manufacture
more cheaply by steam. The resulit is that
to-day there are twenty million negrees in
that country. How many will there bc in
tHe United 'States one hundred years from
now? Figure it eut for yoursclf: by that
time they will have a black race.
The
United States rerninds me of the poor old
mule: he lias no anccstry, and can have ne
future.
One thîin, further I desire te, say to the
acti n- leader (Hon. Mr. Beauhien) and to
the leader of this House (Right Hon. Mr.
Mei.-hen), and that is te suggest that we
should net adjourn until the 2Oth of February. If it is, the desire of the House te
adjouro until Tuesday evening, ail right; and
in the meantime the committees could be

TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY

buse learned witb acute sorrow of the sad
and sudden passing of His Majesty King
Albert of Belgium. The circumstances of his
early departure from life, precipitate and
tragie as they were, have served Vo impress
upon the wvorld the unique character of the
serv ice be rendered liunanity at a crucial hur
in the history of the world.
None in this bouse can fail to recaîl the
tension under wbieh the people of every
nation laboured in the terrible hours that
preceded the advent of the World War, and
the sensation of pride we felt, as ýmembers of
the same human family, at the magnificent
and beroic stand taken in that crisis by tbe
littIe nation of Belgium. That ber stand was
inspired, flot only by the heroismn of ber
people, but aIso hy the conspicucus gallantry
of ber King, has ever since been universally
acknowledged. Belgium, of course, had ne
hope whaîever of arresting the mareb of tbe
millions of the German army, but, truc teý
the instinct of seîf-defence, amd determined
that right should be asserted at whatever cost,
she offiered ber sons on the altar of sacrifice
aud earned the everlasting gratitude of mankind. The King took bis place at the head
of bis nation, botb in council and in the
fielýd.
bis son foillowed bim. The wbole
Belgian royal family became the beroes of
their people.
It is impossible now Vo measure the service
donc by that lieroic nation.
No one can
say what migbt bave been the course of
events had she flot taken that stand, but if
opinion at this heur could be sufficiently
infor-med to render an intelligent and approximately correct judgment, it would surely be
that but for Belgium's decision, eue of the
most momentous in the annals; cf time, tbe
whole course and conclusion cf the confliet
would have been different. Therefore the
name of King Albert remains in the miuds
of all, at least in the allied nations, a great
name, to which we look back flot only with
gratitude, but with something approacbing
adoration. That we should now lament his
demise is cf course inevitable, and I amn
sure that this House, in common with the
other House and legislatures the world over,
extends its deepest sympathy Vo the Qucen cf
Belgium and ail the members cf the royal
fam.îly, aud hopes they will ever know the
admiration in wbich we bold the illustricus
memnory cf the deceased monarch.

called, Franz Josef of Austria. Beside them
was the king of a tiny nation of about six
million people, a nation that was by treaty
neutral, and flot called upofi to play an
important part in international affairs.
After the tragedy of Serajevo, on June 20,
the two emperors agreed to ehastise Ser-bia,
even at the cost of a general conflagration.
Germany was convinced at that time that the
hour had struck, as Russia and France were
c]early unpreipared. But Ger-many stood in
need of a casus belli, and manoeuvred day anti
niglit to obtain one, on either the eastern or
the western fTontier, in order that in facing
the world it miglit appear to have a clear
conscience.
For a number of years, under a general programme Germany had been detcrmined to
invade France through Belgium, and on the
26tb of July, some days prior to the detlaration of war, completed a draft ultimatum. It
was sent to Von Bulow, the German Minister
at Brussels, on the 29th of July, with orders
that he was not to open it untili he was wired
instructions to do so. That document stateti:
The German Governînent bas positive inf ormation that the French troops intend to mardi
on the Meuse section by way of Givet and
Namur. . . .The
steps taken by the enemies of Germany will force lier to enter the
Belgian territory.
That was sent on the 29th of July, aithougli
it was not until two days later that the
German Ambassador at Paris asked as to the
intentions of the French Government in the
event of war with Russia. On the 30th of
July, Von Jagow wîred bis Minister at
Brussels to open the sealed envelope wbich
had been sent hi.m, and to execute bis instructions. He added:
The Belgian Government must be given the
impression that ail these instructions bave only
reached you this d-ay.
The duplicity of the German Government
is apparent in tbose lines.
On t.he same day, the 3Oth of July, France
had ordered her covering troops to withdraw
to ten kilometres from tbe frontier. On the
3rd of August Germany declared war on
France, falsely alleging that bombs had been
thrown on Nuremnberg. The Prussian Minister
bimseff deelared at Muni-oh that t.his statement
was an error.
The ultimatum prepared on tbe 26th of
July shows clearly the bad faith and duplicity
of the German Government towards Belgium.
We ail know what followed. The decision of
Belgium surely was, as my riglat honourable
frienti bas saiti, most momentous in the bistory
of the Great War.
It proved to be the
unmaking of Germany, for it brougbt Great

Britain and the Dominions into tbe conflict,
and the invasion of the heroic littie country
aroused universal disapprobation. If the
Allies had been vanquisbed, Belgium probably
would have become a German province.
King Albert risked the fate of bis country
to save the national honour, and lie and bis
people gave to the world a splendid lesson of
moral
courage. Had
Belgium remained
neutral it would have bast its self-respect. Its
enemies haýd an extraordinary fate. The
Ifapsburgs crossed tie Danube on a, punitive
expedition, and, as I bave remarked before,
they came back shorn of their crown and a
large part of their territorial possessions. The
baughty
and
vainglorions
Hohenzollern
learned of his fate on Belgian territory, at
sYpa, and ran away to a foreign land, where
lie is now chojpping wood. But Albert, the
King of Belgium, will ever live ensbrined in
tbe heart and memory of generations to come,
as one wio played the part of tbe chivalrous,
undaunted knight, sans peur et sans reproche,
in the great and fearfui drama flrougli whicb
it was our lot to lîve.
THE LATE SENATOR FORKE
TRIBUTE TO RIS MEMORY

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honouraile members, as if this Huse bati not suffered
enougi losses in tbe long list whicb we recorded in terms of regret ait the opening of
this session, we are now called upon to note
the dealli of one of our members even since
the session began. Senator Robert Forke, of
Brandon, in western Manitoba, who was a
member of tie Senate for more than four
years, bas passed to the Great Beyond. He
was one of a limited number of federwl legisla..
tors in our country who were born outside its
borders. In common with the first two Prime
Ministers of the Dominiýon, he had bis birthplace in old Scotland, a distinction wbicb,
entirely aside from the company in whici lie
shared it, lie valued pruudly indeed. Having
had tbe advantage of an education in bis own
country, lie came to Canada at tie early age
of twenty-two years and took up the vocation
of farming.
is subsequent career affords
about as conspicuous an example of tbe success
of an immigrant as tlus yo ng country can
boast, even 10 Ibis day. Starting witb nothing,
lie built up a reputation tbroughout western
Manitoba for energy and resourcefulness. He
became in lime the reeve of bis municipality,
and perhaps tbe honour whicb lie valued most
highly aniong ail that came to bim was that
of baving been re-elected to that post over
the long lerm of twenty years.

FOREIGN INSIRANCE COMPANIES
BILL
FIRST

READING

Riglît Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN mInroduced Bill B, an Act te anrd tbe Foreign
Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
H1e said: Perhaps tbis timie is as opportune
as any other te lay seme general foundation
for the attention of the lieuse te tbis measure. lionourable members will recaîl that in
1932, by reasen of a succession of adverse
decisions; in the Privy Couacil whicli affected,
if they did net destroy, the right of the Parliament of Canada te legisiate in relation te
insurance, and the riglit of the department
erected hy Parliamont te supervise the operatien of insurance wiîhin Canada, or even the
entrance of foreign companies, it ivas decided
te seek te amend the legisiatien of that time
se as te bî-ing it within the very drastic
limitations wbichi these decisions hiad imposed
upon us. Three Acts were involved. The
first was the Art establishing the Department
of Insuranre; but with that, at the moment,
we have ne cencern. The second was the Act
resperting British and Canadian Insurance
Companies; and witb that we shahl deal in
a mensure te succced this one. The third,
the one presently important, was the Act
respecting Foreign Insurance Companies, and
it is te fnrther amend this Act that I new
introdure the Bill.
It may be in the minds of honourable members that there is much futility, and mest
expensive futlity, in a struggle on behaîf of

FEBRUARY 20, 1934
the federal authorities to maintain their
jurisdiction in respect of insurance. The
situation is one of those brought upon us
by the terms, at the time perhaps wisely
conceived-at all events we will not challenge
their wisdom-of the British North America
Act of 1867. Business in the Dominion in
those days was very substantially different
from what it is to-day. That period might
be described as the horse-and-buggy period in
relation to trade, as in relation to transportation. The Fathers of Confederation in their
effort to draw the dividing line between federal
and provincial jurisdictions had regard to the
nature of the businesses and the scope of
their operations, allocating them either to the
federal side of the line or to the provincial.
If the decisions of the Privy Council are
sound-and we must so accept them-the
conduct of the business of insurance was
placed among provincial responsilbilities. As
to foreign insurance companies, it was without
doubt stringently and finally held that this
Parliament could not tread within provincial
boundaries and seek, under whatever guise,
to supervise the conduct of the business of
such companies. Whether or not, were the
British North America Act the creation of
this time instead of three generations ago,
the line of demarcation would appear where
it does now, cannot concern us; but it is not
an irrelevant observation to suggest that if
the insurance business of that day were of the
dimensions of the insurance business of today, did it have at that time the interprovincial sweep which it has now, it would have
been placed alongside of banking as a federal
responsibility. But while the Constitution remains as it is, we must abide by the decisions thereunder and refrain from overstepping the mark and seeking in any form to
control or supervise the business of insurance.
Such was the purpose of the amendments
to the three Bills which were brought before
this House and very thoroughly reviewed by
the Senate Committee on Banking and Commerce two yeaýrs ago. The various interests
were heard at very great length and with the
utmost patience. The committee sought, under
the best advice it could get, to give to the
Department of Insurance such powers as would
enable it to be useful, and at the same time
to withhold from it powers which it had been
held.by the Privy Council did not belong to
the federal authority. The truth is that, though
we will all agree, after the three adverse
decisions to which I have alluded, that supervision of insurance is provincial, it is deemed
by what one might call the insurance fraternity
generally, and especially by the larger units
74728--S

67

of that fraternity which operate outside the
Dominion, to be of vital importance to them
to have federal supervision and the imprimatur of the federal authority upon their
business, their status and their financial responsibility. It is deemed vital to them that
this should be their privilege for the purposes
chiefly of their status beyond Canada, but
also for the purposes of their prestige within
Canada itself.

And as well it is the desire

certainly of the majority of the provinces,
as expressed in provincial conferences

held

more than once, that the federal functionary
in this department shall not cease to operate.
They feel that they cannot afford the character of service that is essential for effective
supervision of insurance.

Such, I say, is the

desire of not less than five, and, I hope, at
this time, six of the provinces.

For these

reasons solely-not because the Federal Government or Parliament has any desire to add

to the sweep of its own importance, but merely
because it feels it cannot justify retreating
from a function which is deemed essential by
very important interests and by large numbers
of people in this country-it seeks, and seeks
earnestly, such an Act as will reserve to the
federal authorities at least sufficient powers

to enable them to fulfil that function, and at
the same time will not try to attribute to

those authorities

powers which

the Privy

Council has decided are not federal at all.

In the work we did in 1932 we have no
reason to feel that we have failed. A tremendous advance was made in bringing the
Act into a position which the legal advisers
of Parliament feel to be impregnable.

At the

same time the Government is most anxious
that we do not even appear to overstep our

bounds, and it is with a view to making still
more impregnable the constitutionality of these
Acts that amendments are being introduced
this session. Honourable members will recall
that in the Bills of two years ago there were

provisions which looked to the co-operation of
the provinces at a later date in the establishment of a right line of demarcation. That cooperation which we looked forward to has not
yet been in evidence, and consequently this
House is asked, in the first instance, by reviewing two of the Acts, the Foreign Insurance
Companies Act and the British and Canadian
Insurance Companies Act, to seek to make
even more appeal-proof, if that be possible,
the statutes then passed.
Now, I do not know that I should go into
detail as to the carrying out of this object
by the various clauses of the Bill which I now
introduce, but I leave in the minds of honourable members this thought-that we shall have
to listen over again to much of the debate

the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
committee. The amendments embodied in this
Bill have, I might say, one objective, and one
only. Never at any point do we seek to extend
federal jurisdiction, but at several points, running, say, to a dozen, we agree to limit it still
further, hoping we can get it beyond challenge, if possible. There are certain other
features, hardly worth mentioning, in the
nature of incidental and merely verbal corrections. The only object I think it worth
while to emphasize now is the object of making more ironclad than before the provisions
of the measure as competent of the Parliament
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Have the provincial
governments agreed to these amendments?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sorry
to say I cannot answer in the affirmative. So
far as I know, only two provincial governments are adverse to the maintenance of the
Federal Department of Insurance, the governments of Ontario and Quebee.
Have they
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
clearly expressed themselves to that effect?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Those govemments-I hope I am not misinterpreting their position-take the ground
that the Federal Department of Insurance
should simply fold its tent and pass out; that
it is a surplusage, an intrusion, and has no
business to be there; that insurance is provincial, and nothing but provincial, and that
they intend to exercise, not 99 per cent, but
100 per cent of the authority in relation to
jurisdiction within their respective provinces.
To a considerable extent British Columbia
agreed. I marvelled somewhat at the attitude
of that province when it did agree two years
ago. The subject was not up at the late conference, and I am in hopes that the present
Government of British Columbia will fall into
line with the other five provinces on this subject. These five distinctly took the line that
from every standpoint they were strongly in
favour of the maintenance of the federal department and the federal authority. Certainly
it is true that Ontario and Quebec do not
agree to these amendments; they do not agree
to anything.
Naturally their

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, but if
it were not for the practical position taken by
those two provinces there would never have
been any difficulty whatever, because our Acts
would have gone unchallenged. There would
le no difficulty whatever in having our jurisdiction amplified by amendment but for the
opposition of those provinces. They stoutly
oppose. Their attitude is, what we have we
will hold.

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. G. H. BARNARD moved the second
reading of Bill A, an Act with respect to
Hospital Sweepstakes.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
identical in form with the one which passed
this House last session. On that occasion
the principle was thoroughly discussed; therefore I do not deem it necessary to deal with
this measure at any great length.
The purpose of the Bill is to empower the
Attorney-General of any province to authorize a committee to conduct sweepstakes or
lotteries within the province, and to make
regulations for their conduct, specifying how
much of the proceeds shall be applied for the
benefit of the hospitals and what percentage
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

shall be allowed for expenses and for prizes,
and providing, of course, for proper audits.
I cannot emphasize too strongly that this is
not a proposal to enable any individual or
group of individuals to make private gain.
The safeguards in the Bill are such that the
money to be derived from the sweepstakes
can be devoted only to the uses mentioned
therein.
With regard to the need for the Bill, the
financial necessity of the hospitals, in many
provinces at least, is greater to-day than ever
before. I may say that the main revenue of
the hospitals in the province of British Columbia is derived from three sources-iprovincial
grants, municipal grants, and moneys which
come in from patients in the hospitals who
are able to pay for treatment and accommodation. The Government bas been in the habit
of giving the hospitals a per capita allowance
in accordance with the number of patients
treated by them, but owing to the financial
straits in which it has found itself this allowance bas been materially reduced. Furthermore, owing to a certain overlapping, or alleged
overlapping, of taxation in my province, the
Government bas taken revenues which the
municipalities assert should belong to them.
In the past, in order to make up for this, a
proportion of those revenues was returned to
the municipalities; but now such grants are
practically wiped out. The result is that the
municipalities are no longer in a position to
give as much financial aid to the hospitals as
they did in the past. With regard to the
revenue from puy patients, it is sad to relate
that the business depression bas so seriously
reduced the incomes of patients that the
hospitals have found great difficulty in collecting the amounts owing to them from that
source. In fact, about a year ago I read a
statement to the effect that one hospital of
considerable size had been able to collect only
fifty-three per cent of the debtsowingto.itin
the prcvious year. That was 1931, if I remember correctly, and I can assure honourable
members that in this respect conditions have
not improved.
Since the last session of this Parliament the
Royal Commission in England which was inquiring into the whole question of gambling
has filed its report. That report is unfavourable to the holding of lotteries or sweepstakes
in aid of hospitals or for any other purpose.
I may say that frorm a reading of the report,
in the short time that I have had at my disposai, I have not found it particularly convincmg.
The opposition is based upon two grounds,
the first being thât lotteries and sweepstakes,

FEBRUARY 22, 1934
as sueli, are rnora'l.ly bad for the people. So
far as this point is concerned, there is really
noV rnuch Vo be said. The argumients pro and
con have been debated in this Chamber duwfing
the Iat, two or three yeare, anid I do not "hik
that people who held, etrong v'iews ou one side
or 'the other have changed them to any greùt
extent as a 'resuJt. It is idie to attempt Vo
coivert to the prinicipoes of this Bill a person
who believes that the purchssing of a lottery
ticket is a sinful act; it is equally idie to
atternpt Vo, convinoe a peirson who ha-s been
in the habit of buying tickets of Vhiis desoription that such a practice is in the least reprehensible. Therefore 1 do flot intend to, dwell
upon this feature at ail.
The second ground upon whieh the Commission bases its findi.ng is t-hat the conduet
of lotteries or sweepstakes for the benefit of
hospitals in England would diminish the
voluntaýry contributions now made towards
maintenance. As a matter of fact, such a
ground does not exist in the Dominion of
Canada. As I stated before, the hospitals in
this country have Vhree sources of revenueprovincial grants, municipal grants, and
revenue from pay patients; and I think I arn
correct in saying that the revenue which cornes
frorn volun.tary contributions towards the
maintenance of hospitais--and I distinguish
between day-to-day maintenance and capital
expenditure-is infinîtesimal wihen compared
with the surns derived frorn other sources. If
I arn wrong in this, my honourable friend
from East Kootenay (Hon. Mr. King),
who is rnuch more conversant with this
side of the subi ect than I arn, can correct me. I think, however, that in making this staternent I arn perfectly within
the facts. In~ any event, the total of some
fifteen million pounds per annum voluntarily
subsoribed for the maintenance of hospitals in
England is, as I understand, administered on
a basis entirely different fromn that prevailing
in this country. The medical work for the
outdoor and the poorer patients is, I understand, done voluntarily. A member of the
medical profession considers it an honour, I
amn told, to be appointed to the surgical or
medical staff of one of those bospitals, and
anyone so chosen gives his services to the
hospital free of charge. The whole systern,
as I say, is different from the systern that
obtains in this couintry, and to my mind the
reasoning of the Commission does not apply
to the 'hospitals in Canada.
Since this House last considered this subject something else bas happened. I refer to,
the very important *-upport and advocacy of
a measure such as this from the great province of Quebec, and from no less a person than

71

the Hon. Mr. Taschereau hirnseif. According
to reports I have read in the press, at the
recent Provincial Conference Mr. Taschereau
pressed the Dominion Government to pass
legisiation. along the lines suggested in this
Bill; and I arn informed and belileve that he
feels strongly enough on the subjeet to have
caused to be introduced at the present session of the Quebec Legisiature a bill which
would enable him to take advantage of this
or any simîlar measure whîch Parlisment
might enact. Judging by this action of Mr.
Taschereau and by other things of which I
have heard since my arrivai in Ottawa, I
feel safe in saying that public opinion in
favour of a bull of this kind is steadily growing
throughout the country. I know that is s0 ini
my own province.
To put it shortJy, it appears Vo me that the
henefits that woul corne frorn this Bihl are
three-fold. In the first place, it would provide
ample funds for the maintenance of our hoepitale, hunds that would be derived from a
source at present contrîbuting absolutely
riothing towards such an object. I amn well
aware that the peuple who would buy lottery
or sweepstake tickets, il the Bill were passed,
would not do so froim any specsaà desire to
benefit the hospitals; neverffheless a portion
of the money which they spent on suieh tickets
would be turned over Vo the hospital, and thc
total of these inoneys would be sufficient Vo
mainjtain such institutions. Secondly, the passing of thie messure would enabL people Vo do
Iegally what they are now doing i'legaly.
Unidoubted]ly, as every member of this House
knows, the sale and purohase of lottery and
sweepstake tickets is widespread throughout
the Dominion. This is not a desirable state of
affairs, for it tends Vo bring our law into conternpt, and I repeat, that we camn rernedy the
situation by passing legisiation of the kind
now proposcd. Thirdly, such legisiation. would
check ýto some extent, at least, the steady flow
of rnoney frorn Canada for the purchese of
lottery tickets in other countries. This is a
matter worth consideration, though possibly of
minor importance.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:

72

SENATE

long on the reasons on which I base my
opinion. Nor shall I talk about the moral
aspects of the question, for it secms to mie
it is altogether unnecessary to do so in timelike these, when we are trying to do c erything posible to encourage diligence. Surely
it must bc realizel to-ilav that if we are to
emerge fromi this depression we nst advocate
work and not leisure, particuilarly not the kind
of leisure that has its source in gambling and
chance. However, I shaH say no more about
that, because, as I am frank to admit, some
very respectable authorities in our country
seem to have been forced by dire necessity
to a material change of view on this subjeet.
My honourable friend has mentioned Hon.
Mr. Taschereau. In my own province there
are other eminent and respectable persons, incluiding some who should be our guides in
moral matters, who do not seem now to be
opposed, as they formerly were, to the fundamental principle of sweepstakes and lotteries.
It seems to me that there is one question
we must ask ourselves first of all. Would this
Bill do alIl that its sponsors claim? I submit
it would not. Out of every dollar spent on
sweepstake tickets twenty cents would be devoted to the very meritorious objoct of hospital aid, and fifty cents woul'd be used to
teach our people to speculate and to gamblefifty cents for bad education.
If this Bill is passed, every province will
find it necessary before long to hold a lottery.
I am not preaching for the province of Quebec,
for apparently it has decided to countenance
the desperate means of raising funds by sweepstakes, but I am speaking more particularly
with reference to the other provinces, which
have not taken that stand. It is argued in
some quarters that if we had sweepstakes we
could keep in our own country much of the
money that is now going to Ireland, and even
as faýr as India, for the purchase of tickets.
So far we have been able to resist this argument, but if a lottery were established in one
of our provinces and tickets were being sold
throughout the country, do you not think
that before long every other province would
find itself compelled to follow the example in
order to prevent money from being taken
outside its borders? In my opinion it is
certain that if a lottery is instituted in one
province there will soon be lotteries in all
nine provinces. Then, with the increase in
the lotteries and in the circulation of their
tickets, it will be harder to make sales in
face of strong comopetition.
It is said that the sale of lottery tickets
would provide a new source for hospital
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

funds. It may be that many people who
speculate on weepstakes are not contributors
to hospital maintenance, but on the other
hand we must remembar that legislation of
Ihis kind would result in making habitual
ticket buyers of thousands of our hard-working citizens who to-day do not gamble at all
-perhaps not that they think to de so would
be immoral, but because they have no natural
leaning towards that kind of thing. It seems
to me that with a lottery in every province,
after the novelty of the thing had disappeared and it had become difficult to sell the
tickets, the net revenue accruing to the
hospitals would not be very great. Besides, we
have to-day large numbers of devoted people
who give of their time and money towards
the assistance of hospitals, and who make
good any deficiency that arises after the provincial and municipal grants have been paid.
At least, that is true in the province of
Quebec. Well, that source of voluntary revenue would be gone if this Bill should pass.
It is strange, after al, that we cannot benefit
by the experience of other countries. This
kind of thing has been tried time and again
in Europe and abandoned. One reason why
the British commission of inquiry reported
against lotteries was that experience had condemned them. Why car we not profit by what
bas happened abroad? And may I say, honourable members, that some of the lotteries conducted in Europe were vastly different from
what i.s proposed here. It is true that France,
when hari-pressed, authorized the issue of
what were known as bons de la ville de Paris,
but they were first and foremost an investment, not a gamble. The purchaser of one of
those bonds was guaranteed that within a
certain period his capital would be refunded,
together with interest at the rate of three per
cent, and the only element of chance in those
transactions was the spread in the interest
rate between tbree per cent and whatever rate
of interest was established. But, as I say, every
person who bought such a bond was told that his
investment was guaranteed by the state. Yet
even that kind of thing bas been generally
abandoried,
although
quite
lately some
countries 'have been so hard-pressed that they
have been constrained to do certain things
which experience had taught them were unwise.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think that
unless we get an expianation we should not
proceed with the second reading. This Bill is
in a somewhat different class from the Foreign
Insurance Companies Bill, which was explained
to us by the right honourable leader of the
House when he introduced it last Thursday,
and which is similar to one that we had under
examination for several weeks last session.
The present mensure may be of such a
character that the House would not want ta

and universities. In the city of Montreal at
the present time some of our charitable organizations are perhaps more desperately in
need of funds than are the hospitals. Let us
have a chance to help these organizations. And
in the province of Quebec we have a university
that needs addi.tional funds. If the Bill is to
be passed, let it be wide enough at all events
to be of some assistance there as well.
On motion of Hon. G. V. White, the debate

SENATE
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
whlen I asked for information with regard to
the cost of this route I was pretty well informed as to the actual amount, but I placed
the question on the Order Paper so as to
be in order in discussing the subject. This
project lo-oms up for discussion at almost
every session, being introduced usually by
those who are opposed to it. Much bas,
therefore, been said for or against the scheme;
mostly against it. It is true that the information we have had pro and con bas been
more or less oonflicting, but of one feature we
have been certain-that for more than two
hundred years tAie Hudson's Bay Company
navig1ated those waters successfully, witb an
inferior class of boats, without experiencing
any serious losses. What we have learned
during the past two seasons bas to a large
extent shown that the difficulties in the navigating of the northern waters may be overcorne without much trouble.
Last August 1 visited the port of Churchill
and had a very interesting and instructive
trip. The last town before we enter into the
northern country is The Pas, an enterprising
rentre in Northern Manitoba with a population of about four thousand. It is an up-todate town in every respect. Incidentally
Il had the pleasurer of examining several
gardens there on the 13th of August, and I
may inform bonourable gentlemen that neyer
in my experience have I seen finer vegetable
and flower gardons than I saw at that time.
The Pas may bie considered the gateway to
the Hudson Bay. From this point north the
distance to Churchill is about 510 miles. I am
sorry that my honourable friend fýrom Calgary (Hon. Mr. Burns) is not here, because,
as some of you may remember, be stated
last year that the country from The Pas to
Hudson Bay was of no value whatsoever
1 do not know what the bonourablo gentleman'
was thinking about. On my trip I kept my
eyes open, and for the first two or three
hundred miles 1 sawv a large quantity of itimber
of vanious sizes, valleys that may be brought
under cultivation, and rivers and lakes teeming wîth fish. The road-bed it-self is well
ballasted, and on it are laid eighty-pound
rails. The altitude of The Pas is about one
thousand feet higher than that of Churchill;
consequontly there is more or less of a down
grade, and an ordinary locomotive can handle
from forty to fifty loaded cars witbout any
difficulty between The Pas and Hudson Bay.
At a divisional point three hundred and
fifty miles north of The Pas we had occasion
ta stol) for an bour, and again at that point
I hiad an opportunity of examining a beautiRiglit Hoii. Mr. MEIGHEN.

ful flower and vegetable garden. For two
hundred miles north of that the country is,
1 may say, of ro particular value.
When our train arrived at Churchill what
first attracted my attention was the fine cIevator and the steamship Pennyworth, which
liad docked just two bours before. Anothor
thing wbich caught my eye was a beautiful
church and seminary on the littie hill to the
east.
Hon. Mr.
tion?

CASGRAIN:

What

denomina-

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Just wait until 1 have
finished and you will know. I nsked someone
there what eburehi that was. You will remember tbat my honourable friend (Hon. Mr
Casgrain) stated last yoar that this is a Godforsaken country. What authority be had for
tryîng to limit the omnipresence of the AImighty is more than I have ever been able
to understand. I was informed that the
church is a Roman Catholic church. Evidently my honourable friend is out of toucb
with bis co-religionists; otherwise they would
not bave built a church and seminary in a
God-forsaken country.
I travelled around the town. It is of course
comparatively new. There are a few small
stores, two churebes besides the one I have
mentioned, and two bank buildings, one of
thema vacant and the other occupied last
season by the Bank of Montreal.
I bad occasion to visit the wireless station,
and, fortunately for me, the operator wvas a,
young lad whom I have knýoNn for some
years. In conversation I asked hlm, "Are
there an', boats in sight?" H1e said, "Yes, the
Nascopie is twenty miles out, the Brandon
is about fifty-five miles out, and there are
others coming along at various intervals for
many hundreds of miles." I asked if ho was
in touch with those boats, and ho said, "Yes,
wvith them al"and when I inquired if they
were experiencing any difficulty, he said, "No,
not, the sýlightest."'
The harbour of Churchill is, I think, the
most interesting feature of that port. It is
a na-tural barbour and is numbe-red amongst
the best barbýours of the ýworld. At its mouth
it is from haîf to three-quarters of a mile
wi(le; thon it spreads out to a width of from
two to three miles, and ex.tends south for a
distance of between four and five miles to the
mouth 'of the river. At the mouthi of the
harbour the depth of water at low tide iýs
scventy-eighit foot, and in its natural state
it can accommodate dozens of the largest
vessels afloat without any necessity for dredging or anything of that kind.

FEBRIJARY 27, 1934
Last session there was some reference to
the only casualty that I know of on the
Hudson Bay, nameAy the loss of -the steamer
Bright Fan. That ship, as honourable members know, came in contact with an iceberg.
I want to read a short ex'tract f rom the report
of the Royal Commission which was appointed
to investigate tbe disaster.
Q. Was a good and proper look-out maintained on board at aIl times after leaving
Churchill?
The court thînks that a proper
A. No.
look-out was not kept on the Bright Fan.
There was no expressly appointed look-out and
for soine minutes before the collision with the
iceberg apparently the only person on the ship
who bad any opportunity of seeing the approach
of danger was the helmsman, an apprentice of
18 years of age.
I think tbat proves beyond all éoubt that
the Ioss of -the slip was entirely due to
Let us be as generous os we
carelessness.
may, it seems to mie that is the only reasonable explanation of tbe disaster.
When dealing lest session witb the navigability of the Hudson Bay route my honourable
friend from De Lanaudière MHon. MT. Casgrain) advocated. the use of a certain kind
of boats, known as sauoer bottoms. I do neot
know whetber any boats of that build have
ever navigated the Hudson Bay, but my
bonourable friend's idea seemed to be 'that if
sucb a boat came in contact with floating ice
the boat could climb up on top and use the
ice as a common carrier. He might bave
extended this idien and suggested that these
vessels elimb on top of any icebergs that'they
happened Vo meet, and use them also as
comsnon carriers.
On the question of navigability I quoted
Captain Bernier last session. I very mucb
regret that I have mislaid a letter I received
from bim. last Christmas, with whichbch enclosed a copy of one wbich by order of the
King bad been forwarded Vo him when bie
was in England lest year, commending bis
HMs statement
work in nortbiern regions.
which I quoted last year was that the Hudson
Bay was navigable practically ahl the year
round. I arn noV going to stress that point.
My bonourable friend from De Lanaudière
also said lest year, with regard Vo the selection
of Port Nelson, that sailors should be consulted in preierenoe to engineers about barheurs and navigation. At page 453 of Hansard
of last year I find these words of bis:
The great trouble with governments is that
they insist upon consulting engineers about
harbours and navigation. When it cornes to
building wharves, superintending dredging, or
something of that sort, engineers are very
useful: but when we want Vo know about the
navigability of waters adjacent to a certain

75

port we ought to consult sea captains and
sailormen, who know something about navigation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes, sailormen.
That is exactly the
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:
kind of men 1 arn going to quote. 1 have
ah-eady referred to Captain Bernier's statement. Now may I quote what was said by
Captain Gofton, of the steamship Penmyworth,
the first boat to arrive at Churchill last
season. He bas sailed frequently into the
ports of Montreal and Vancouver, but this
was bis first trip to Churchill. He was very
favourably impressed by the Hudson Bay
route. The f ollowing is an extract from a
newspaper story referring to his impressions:
"I would much rather navigate Hudson
Strait and Hudson Bay thýan the St. Lawrence,"
bie said, and is so reporting to his company.
"The seaway is saf or and aids to navigation
are in the main satisfactory."
.He believes that, on this year's showing, the
insurance season should be made longer, for the
Pennyworth encountered only about 14 icebergs,
f ew growlers and no loose ice.
So be did not have any loose ice to carry
his ship along.
He suggests one more wireless station in the
@trait, preferably on Digge's Island, in order
to perfect direction-finding, and also a fog siren
and a whistle buoy in Churchill harbour. The
aid rendered by the ice-breaker ship,' McLean,
be termed splendid. Since the Pennyworth is
equipped with a gyro compass and electrical
sounding apparatus, the uselessness of the
magnetie compass in the strait was offset. The
amount of ice seen was less than that encountered on the Belle Isle route to Montreal, and
the only difflculty experienced during the whole
trip was that caused Saturday night and
Sunday by beavy fog over Hudson Bay.
He secs a great future for the Hudson Bay
route as a grain shipping line at a rate of two
shillings and ninepence per 80 bushels, and for
imports into Western Canada and the far
western States.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

FEBRUARY 27, 1934
George H. Smith, secretary, listed the
practicable exports during the coming year and
compared freight and storage rates to show
that $1,250,000 could be saved by shipping
through the Bay route.
Development of the route via Churchill was
the principal business of the meeting, Mr.
Fortington pointed out. He had found many
erroneous ideas as to the efficiency of Churchill.
One of the biggest obstacles to export by
Western Canadian shippers was that they found
their prices out of line, due to the expense of
the long rail haul. Churchill should be the
solution of the Western exportera' problem by
reducing exporting charges.
I repeat, honourable members, that I am
not quoting these newspaper reports in order
to discredit the St. Lawrence waterway. Undoubtedly it is a good route, but it has its
defects just as bas the Hudson Bay route.
We are proud of the successful operation of
the St. Lawrence route. It has been a great
national undertaking. But I submit that the
Hudson Bay route will prove just as successful and just as beneficial to Canada.

Now I desire to direct the attention of the
House to the test shipments of cattle over
the Hudson Bay route. In this connection I
cannot do better than read statements made
by the exporters themselves and the opinions
Mr. Macdonald
of cattlemen generally.
Holmes states:
It cost the Western Stock Growers Association, Calgary, an average of $32.22 a head to
ship and market the 200 head of cattle that
constituted the first shipment of stock out of
the Hudson's Bay.
It cost $28.32 per head to take the cattle
from the farms to Birkenhead -and $3.90 per
head to sell them on the other side.
The interesting costs are those of getting the
cattle over, for the selling costs on the other
side are always about the same, no matter
from where the shipment comes, nor by what
route.
The shipment shows a saving in favour of
the Hudson's Bay route over shipments made
by the Montreal route. Here are the average
cost figures per head on the Churchill trial shipment, compared with the costs on two other
shipments via Montreal, one of which was of
heavy cattle and one light:

I submit, honourable senators, that I have
demonstrated that the Hudson Bay route is
capable of handling a very substantial portion of the commodities of the Prairie Provinces. At the present time additional elevator
storage is needed at Churchill. With a
storage capacity of fifteen or twenty million
bushels of wheat there would be no difficulty
about getting cargo space. Ship owners are
ready and eager to handle all the traffic we
can offer them.
Now as to the cost of the Hudson Bay
Railway. The actual cost to date, including
the Port Nelson terminal, is said to be $55,000,000. In reference to this expenditure it
must be borne in mind that certain lands in
the Prairie Provinces were set apart for the
purpose of the building of the railway. From
these lands the Federal Government realized
for pre-emptions $18,697,346, and for purThere is a

Deducting the total of $25,142,186 from the
total cost-and we have a perfect right to do
this, since the lands belonged to the provinces-we find that the actual cost to the
country is about $30,000,000. In these figures
I am muking no allowance for interest. I do
not want to reflect on other ports, but those
who complain of the cost of the Hudson Bay
route should not lose sight of what it has cost
the country to provide other outlets for our
commerce. So far as I have been able to
ascertain, we have spent on the St. Lawrence
waterway $300,000,000. In addition we are
spending every year large sums of money for
dredging the channel between Montreal and
Quebec. This work alone has entailed an
expenditure of $6,500,000 during the last five
years. There is very little dredging required
at Churchill. Two dredges were assigned to
the harbour at the outset, but it has been

We do nlot objeet te a sing-le cent of that

commodities, you should net object to our
lîaving a port in the north.
A few days ago the Prime Minister, speaking in Montreal, ýmade the statement that in
ten years the Western Provinceo had produced wealth te the extent of ten billion
dollars. Nobody imagines for a moment that
the producers of that we'aith ke-pt it te themselves. I venture te say that a large percentage of it found it.s waV te the indtntrial

centres of Eastern Canada, to be used in the
purchase of farm implements and other manufactured articles, thus adding to the wealth
and progress of the whole country.
Now if, by reason of the opening up of
the Hudson Bay route, the grain-grower can
get a few cents more for his grain, or the
stock-raiser a few dollars more for his animals,
undoubtedly a greater degree of prosperity
will be brought to Canada. To oppose the
development of Churchill, therefore, or of any
other port, would be to retard the progress
of the whole Dominion.
Those of you who attended the World's
Grain Show in Regina last year may have
noticed an exhibit of grain grown within
twelve miles of the Aretie Circle.
Sanples of wheat, oats and barley grown
within twelve miles of the Aretic Circle, are
interesting exhibits in the section of the Grain
Show building occupied by the Cereal Division
of the Experimental Farme.
W. D. Albright, of the Dominion Experimental Substation, Beaverlodge, Alberta, is in
charge of the exhibit, which shows many of
the produets of the territory known as the
Maekenzie Basin, which occupies 682,000 square
miles. The ground cultivated was formerly
muskeg, and although the wheat is seed grade
only, the barley and oats grade 3 and 4 C. W.
Oats sown the latter part of May were eut
August 9. In this district it is possible te
produce ample wheat grain and fodder, although
export is handicapped by transportation.
In Resolution, on the Great Slave Lake, there
are two apple trees, seedlings, which have been
growing for years and produce enough fruit
each year te make about 20 pounds of jam.
The district, thirteen miles from Beaverlodge,
whioh is approximately twenty-five miles in
radius, has won more prizes in the Grain
Show than any district of similar size in
Canada.
Now I want to say a word in conclusion.
Canada must expand. Many of our resources
are te be found in the north country. That
alone should convince us that there are great
possibilities in our great Northland, and that
the energies of the people of Canada must be
turned in that direction in order te develop
the hidden treasures that undoubtedly are
there. We cannot go farther sou'th; so we must
endeavour te move northward. For years
people have been farming near the boundary,
in the southwestern portion of Saskatchewan
and in the southeastern section of Alberta.
Now they have found out that they cannot
carry on successfully in that area, and to-day
most of them, or all who can, are moving north
four or five hundred miles.
Of course there are difficulties to be contended with in the north. There is tihe cold.
But during the last winter the average temperature in Churchill was not much lower than
the temperature in Ottawa, and very little
lower than the temperature in many parts of

Northern Ontario. We Canadians are a hardy
race. Cold is no handicap. We are accustomed te hard winters; we thrive on them
and get along splendidly.
The Hudson Bay Railway has two branch
lines that connect with certain mines producing
great wealth. Undoubtedly there is immense
wealth in that northern part of the country,
and the Hudson Bay Railway is the first link
connecting southern Canada with our great
Northland.
Seme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: With the permission of
the House I should like te place on Hansard
a report relating te a test shipment of cattle
by way of the Hudson Bay route. This is taken
from the log of the steamship Brandon, day
by day. I think honourable gentlemen will
find it extremely interesting.
Brandon's Captain Prefers Churchill to St.
Lawrence--Storm Delays Ship 25j Houri
Entering Liverpool Port-Cattle Landed
Safely and in Good Shape at
Birkenhead
Liverpool, England, (by mail).--Western Canada's first experimental shipment of cattle over
the Hudson Bay route has demonstrated that
physically the Churchill way is at no physical
disadvantage when compared with the Montreal
route. . . .
We lost only eight hýours out of Churchillby stopping two nights-but a storn at the
'bar" of the Mersey lost us 25A hours entering

Liverpool.
We left Churchill October 2 and the cattle
were landed at Birkenhead on October 17. The
cattle landed in good shape.
Monday, October 2.-It was a rolling sea
with the wind "abaft the beam" ewhen the SS.
Brandon, homeward bound from Churchill te
Birkenhead with the first shipment of cattle
out of western Canada's new port, dropped the
pilot less than an heur after leaving ber berth.
Loaded te within three inches of ber plimsol
line, the biggest ship ever in Churchill, was as
steady as a rock. She rolls beautifully. Snow
flurries came with this wind on ber stern
quarter and before dark blotted out the laid
behind. It was all sea forward, with no land
either te port (left facing the bow) or starboard.
Tuesday, October 3.--Day broke cold and
cloudy with a beam wind bringing the snow
flurries straight across the decks. The shallow
bay has quite a sea on, the going is choppy
and every once in a while the heavily loaded
Brandon "ships" one over the port side, mnidships. Still she makes ber steady nine knots.
No land in sight at any time.
Wednesday, October 4.-Day broke clear and
bright with the bay like glass and a gentle
breeze "forward off the beam" which made it
cold work for the tars up front painting the
bridge its usual white to have it gleaming when
the ship comes into her home port. The night
came down without a cloud and a beautiful
full moon which made the master smile and
rub his hands. The ship will be entering the
straights to-night, but it will be another 24
heurs before "ice" becomes a menace.

The wind got up during the night and the
heavily loaded Brandon has been getting her
decks washed all day. To-night, however, the
stars are out and the wind has shifted to the
starboard quarter-lending a hand as we crawl
for the Irish coast-2,073 miles covered to
4 p.m.
According to wireless reports from ships on
the regular route to Montreal, similar weather
prevails. It has been this way ever since we
left Greenland.
Last night the radio brought in Rome with
its woman announcer, several German stations
and some French ones. We stuck to London,
however, since none of us " ain't never been
able to speak but one language correct," and
after Lord Rutherford got through an amazing
romance with the atomic nucleus we found
that Premier Bennett had started his western
tour at Winnipeg and was his usual optimistie
self.
We also. Iearned that an outbreak of footand-mouth disease vas discovered in Hartford
and Essex, which will probably mean a ban
on imports of live stock from Britain to Canada
for some months to come. The London Dog
Show is also on, with some 3,000 hounds
entered. Cockers lead with 489 entries.
The program ended with Big Ben's midnight
chime after an hour with Roy Fox from the
Kit-Kat club just off Trafalgar Square. Must
look into that dive next week.
Friday, October 13.-There's a depression in
Iceland, according to the weather report, and
the result is a gale on the north Atlantic.
However, it's in our tail and hardly noticeable.
The Kenilworth passed about noon, outward
bound for Newfoundland and pulp, and she was
taking them over her bows in clouds.
The Brandon is on the regular north Atlantic
route now and to 4 p.m., 11 days out of
Churchill, has covered 2,283 miles.
The cattle are shipping well and we have
about five days' feed left, plenty to see us into
Birkenhead.
The sun appeared, through broken clouds,
for the first time since we left Churchill and
the officers were able to get the ship's bearing,
the first they've had since Resolution. She
was only a few miles from where they thought
she was, speaking well for their seamanship.
Saturday, October 14.-The wind shifted
around to our starboard beam this morning and
ais a result the log now reads: "Strong wind
and rough beam sea--ehipping water."
Fortunately, my cabin is on the lee side.
At the end of 12 days out of Churchill, the
Brandon had covered 2,505 miles.
Oattle
weathering the blow well. The usual Saturday
afternoon boat drilI provided the only excitement.
Sunday, October 15.-Land! The Tory Island
light, off the northwest coast of Ireland, hove
in sight at 6.30 to-nigh.t. At nine we were
abeam of Inishtrahull light on the north coast.
We should bt in the Mersey early to-morrow
evening.
Several "odds and eods," like ourselves, were
passed to-day outward bound. Two liners also
passed close by.
The wind has been on the starboard beam
all day and the sea fairly rough. Last night
it was pretty heavy and about 11 p.m. we
shipped one that flooded the starboard cabine
and broke up the jolly boat a bit.

81

To 4 p.m., 13 days from Churchill, the
Brandon has done 2,721 miles.
The sun shone to-day for the first time, really,
and the officers got another bearing. They had
not altered their course for three days and
when they checked-up to-day were only a mile
from where they thouglit they were. Good seamanship, that!
Monday. October 16.-The pilot came aboard
about 6 p.m. and the trip is over. We'll enter
the Mersey on high tide, midnight, and dock
to unload the cattle at 9.30 a.m. The lumber
will also be discharged here and then the ship
goes on to leave the wheat, .powdered eggs and
honey in the port of London.
Dawn broke with the Brandon abeam of
Belfast and by noon she had passed into the
Irish sea by the Isle of Man, close in to the
Calf.
Storm signals were out as she neared Liverpool and the sea choppy, but the pilot came
aboard and will take her in.
The voyage froni Churchill has been a few
days longer than it might have been from
Montreal. Otherwise, weather and everything
else considered, the ship might just as well
have been sailing the Belle Isle route.
A hotel. a bath and a steak will look pretty
good to-morrow. . . .
Tuesday, October 17.-You never can tell.
With a storm on the Irish sea the pilot refused
to take the heavily loaded Brandon over the
" barr " and she sailed about the harbour
entrance aill night and did not get into the
river until 11.30 a.m. Here she lay at anchor
all day waiting for high tide to put into the
cattle dock at 7.30 p.m. This ended our picturetaking aspirations. The cattle looked good going off under the lights and there was much
favourable comment on their quality.
The Brandon lost eight hours because of
fog in the Hudson Bay route ice area. At the
entrance te the Mersey she lost 25j hours because of bad weather'and shallow water.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honeurable
gentlemen, the honourable senator from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis) referred quite
frequently to "the honourable gentleman,"
and I took it that he referred to myself,
because he did make one attempt to pronounce the name De Laînaudière. It is rather
difficult to pronounce; it is also rather long.
I must give the honourable gentleman
credit for making an excellent speech in support of a very poor cause, a bad scheme.
When the honourable gentleman speaks of
Churchill being a harbour, he is quite right.
For twenty-five years in this House I have
been saying that there was no harbour at
Nelson; that the only harbour, such as it is,
was at Churchill. For reasons that are of no
interest to this House, I have had considerable
to do with people who have sailed into Churchill, and therefore know something about it.
I may tel! you that the coast at Churchill
runs just about north and south, and as the
entrance to the harbour is at the very most
about half a mile wide, no ship's captain

in the open until the wind subsided, before
atternpting to enter the harbour. I make that
staternent on the authority of Captain Max,
who for sixteen years was in charge of the
shipping of the Huclson's Bay Comnpany.
Whilst I arn talking about hirn 1 may say
that during the Great War ahl British sbipping
was entrusted to the Huidson's Bay Cornpany.
This is the sarne Captain Max who went into

northern route because ne submarines would
venture there. He also went to Bergen, the
rnest northerly port in Norway.
There is ne doubt in my mind at ail that
Churchill is a harbour. I have said it in this
House before, andi I re-peat it. We wasted our
rnoney when we engaged a gentlemnan by the
narne of Palmer to go nortb. at God knows
wbat expense, in order that he rnight tell us
that there was a better harbour at Churchill
than at Port Nelson, where we bad sunk many
millions of dollars. When a ship is sixteen
miles out frorn Port Nelson she bias only
seventeen feet of w'atcr. Furtherrnore, it is
impossible to dredge thse sult that cornes
down tho Nelson river. You rnight just as
well try to rnake a hole in a barrel of peas.
It is an utter irnpossibiliiy. When Earl Grey
went frorn Ottawa to Port NelsonHon. Mr. GILLIS: That bas been abanJoned. What is the use of talking about it
now?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 shoulsi like to
Iraw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the fact that I did net interrupt hima
ivhen he was speaking.
When Earl Grey wanted to go out from
Port Nelson to bis ship-it was not a very
deep diraf t vessel-she was so far out that
dayligbt rockets hasi to be sent up te guide
the boat that was taking birn frorn the shore.
If the Government of the day in Canada, ne
matter who they were, had listened to what
was said in this Huse. they would have
kn.own better than to select Nelson. What
was said here was confirmed first by the land
suri eyors who were sent to Hudson Bay by
the Ontario Governmýent to lay eut a tewn.
W'hen they arrived there a northwe-st wind
was blowing-, and it raisesi the water to suoh
an extent that the site of -the propususi town
was subrnerged. The surveyors put in their
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

time, and when they came back in the faîl
they reported that there wvas no place for
the location of a town.
A well-known Governrnent engineer, Mr.
McLachlan, who had been at Nelson, and had
stood it for three or four years, sa.id there
wa.s no harbour. Mr. Bowden, Chief Engineer
of the Departrnent of Railway and Canais,
had an iland buit in the river. Certain parts
of this island were surrounded by a cribwork
about fifty feet in heigb't that was supposed
to be filled in. Then a bridge was actually
bujît frorn the east side of the Nelson river
te. this artificial island, and wha.t rcrnains of
it to-day is a monument to what governments
do. The piers are there, and some of the
ironwork that waýs erected for a distance of
nearly haif a mile in order to connect with
this island. Ships were expected to go outside of the island. If this Governrnent or any
other Governrnent w'ould only read Hansard
of the Senate they would see in it many
things that might be very useful to. them,
and that would save a great deal of the
rnoney of this country.
Nowv I corne to the harbour at Fort
Chuirchill. If a ship can get into, that harbour
it will find plenty of space there. But there
are aise large boulders. any number of them.
Although sorne have been dynarnited ànd
taken out, rnany remain. I arn told that a
ship coming into that harbour expefriences
difficiîlty in turning around. I get that information frern sailormen. flot frorn erigineers.
I wvi1l admit that Churchill is a better harbour
than Nelson; but wlien rny bonourable friend,
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) says that it is one of the
finest harbours in the world, I can only say
that he mus-t have spent ail bis life on the
Prairies, tbat he is no sailorman, and bas
neot much idca of what a port should be.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I was born in Nova
Scotia.
God made the
lion. Mr. CASGRAIN:
harbours; men rnake the ports.
The bonourable gentlernan quoted rny dear
old fricnd Captain Bernier, wbo spent eigbt
winters in tbe Arctic. Having conquered
nearly aIl the places where it is difficuit to
navigate because of icebergs and se on,
Captain Bernier says, "Oh, well, it is possible
to navigate the Hudson Straits." 0f course
it is possible. But if honourable gentlemnen
would only listen for one moment they would
learn that there are tides in the straits; and,
as you know, tides ebb an.d flow four times
a day. It is just as well that this House
should have -a little information on that subjeot. When tbe Hudson's Bay Company used

FEBRUARY 27, 1934
to send out vessels Captain Max was a tenant
of mine, and for eight years I used to see
him off every year. What would happen when
lie came to enter those straits? Once hie had
an officer of the Mounted Police on board
his ship, and his orders were to do what this
officeir said. When tliey came to, the opening
of the straits the officer said: "Go ahead.
It is clear water." Captain Max feit hie must
obey orders; so hie went in; but after he liad
been there for two or three weeks hie had to
corne out with the flow of the ice. The ship
was pushed back into the Atlantic, and a
second entry had to be macle. So time would
bave been saved if they liad waited until the
ice had ail passed out, before entering at
all.
If you leave Montreal on the 6th or 7th of
July and get to the mouth of the straits
between the 12th and the 15th, you can proceed into the bay with a ship like the
Nascopie. But she is not of ordinary buiId.
My honourable frîend from Saskatcliewan
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) is, I suppose, more familiar
with prairie schooners than with ocean vessels.
On ordinary ships the plates are three-eighths
of an inch thick, but on the Nascopie they
are an inch and a quarter thick, and the entire
hull is strengthened inside with iron braces.
She has a crew of forty men, and the weight
of the steamer itself is s0 great that she can
carry only 1,600 tons of cargo. The N-ascopie
is macle saucer-shaped. My honourable friend
from. Saskatchewan did notrseemn to know what
that meant; s0 I will tell him. Her sides are
shaped somewhat like a saucer, so that if
there is a pressure of ice around the sides
the ship is bound to lift up. If she did not
lift up she would be crushed like an eggshell, and that is just what would happen to
a vessel of ordinary shape.
I can take honourable members back to
1684, when d'Iberville set out for Newfoundland with tliree slips, the Pelican and two
others. In the straits two of tliem were
crushed in the ice, over which the men ran
to board the Pelican. Rie sailed into the bay,
to the exact spot where Port Churchill is now.
There was a fort in that harbour then, known
as Fort Louis, which I am told was about
three hundred feet square, and the remains
of it are to lie seen to this day. When
d'Iberville arrived there he found three
English ships, the Hampshire, tlie Hudson
Bay and the Deering. Hie sailed towards the
Hampshire, the biggest of the three, concentrated the fire of his gun at lier bow, and
blew a gaping boIe in it. As she was going
under full sail, .she soon fiIled witli water
and sank, with ahl on board. The Deering,
thanks to lier fine sailing qualities, got out
74728-O j

of the way, but the Hudson Bay was captured
and taken in as a prize. There was a terrible
snow-storm about that time, which was the
l2tli of September, 1684.
I have talked so often about these things
that it is rather a pleasure to repeat the
same old stories. In any event, everybody
bas not heard tliem.
D'Iberville made a habit of taking Hudson
Bay. Hie left Montreal one time on the 24tli
of March witli Chevalier de Troyes, a Frencli
officer, who lad a notion that lie could transport provisions up to Hudson Bay on the
backs of bullocks and oxen. But at the Lake
of Two Mountains the party found the snow
was very sof t and they liad to send their
bullocks and oxen back to Montreal. So
tley went up the Ottawa river, to Lake
Temiskaming, to Lake Quinze, and tlien over
the Heiglit of Land, and clown the Abitibi
river. For tliree days before they began an
attack tliey refrained from making a fire, in
order that the enemy, wlio were tlien the
Englisli, migît not be aware of tlieir approacli.
Tliey generally stormed the enemy's posta
between tlree and four o'clock in the morning,
wlien everybody was asleep, ancl killed all
tliey founcl there. Tliey must have been
terrible people in those old clays.
On another occasion cl'Iberville started
out witli lis brother, cle Mirecourt, andl captured two English frigates, whidli were loaded
with furs. Being unable to mnan botli friga4es,
they sank one and came back with tlie other,
whicli was wortli a king's ransom. This story
is perliaps getting a littie bit away from tlie
Hudson Bay, but it is only to, show that
we know somne.tling about it.
My lionourable friend from Saskatchewan
lias referred to the navigability of the Hudson
Bay route. Well, if you go clown to tlie
Department of Railways and Canais you can
see a ship's log that gives some interesting
facts. That log is not advertised, any more
than the aclvocates of the eeaway talk about
the canal being frozen in the winter. The
log shows that on the 5th of August the shuip
wasq in ice and fog, with one blade of its
propeller gone, ancl that as it proceeded it
continue.d to lose more and more of its propeller, until wlien it reached Port Nelson, on
the 19th of August, it liad left only about haîf
of one blade. Captain Max of the Nascopie
used to take three propellers along witli him.
Wlien one became broken by tlie ice lie would
stand lis ship off from shore and spot a
place free of boulders; then at high tide lie
woul back bis vessel up there andI beach lier,
ancl wlen the tide went out the damaged
propeller would be removeci and a new one
substituted. But can lionourable members
imagine an ordinary ocean steamer, witli

SENATE

plates only three-eighths of an inch thick,
being subjected to treatment of that kind?
It is preposterous. The Nascopie drew only
about sixteen or seventeen feet of water, and
its plates were so thick that they could resist
any pressure that would likely be met with.
Now, we are told about the 200 head of
cattle that were shipped from Churchill. Will
the honourable member from Saskatchewan
inform this House who paid to have the
partitions built into the ship, and the other
alterations made, so that the cattle could be
carried?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Who paid for dredging the St. Lawrence river?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
who paid for this.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:

The same people

Exactly.

I cannot vouch
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
for this, because it is only hearsay evidence,
but I am told that cattle brokers in Montreal
were a little bit sore to sec the cattle going
around by the Hudson Bay route, and they
said that the cost of shipping them that way
was two or three times the cost of the cattle
themselves. In the first place, a ship had to
be brought out. Who chartered that ship? It
was an experiment, I suppose. I am told that
the Government supplied all the lumber,
because there is no lumber in the immediate
environs of Churchill, and paid the wages of
the carpenters who built the stalls in the
ship. I would not mention in this House the
figure that was stated to me as the cost of
these alterations on the vessel, because it is
se high. As I say, the cattle brokers in
Montreal were a little annoyed, and they may
have exaggerated the cost, but I know for a
fact that it was high. The ship had to come
out to this country in ballast. Every honourable member who knows anything about
ocean transportation is aware that a navigation company does net want to have a vessel
making a trip that will provide only a oneway cargo; in order to make the ship pay for
itself it is necessary to have a cargo going
and coming. Is it reasonable to expect that
a tramp steamer would set out in ballast
from Liverpool for Churchill on the chance of
getting a load of cattle? No. She would
have to be chartered a long time in advance.
Well, I do not know who paid for the chartering of the boat that did come out. It was
an experiment which, for the sake of the taxpayers of this country, I hope will never be
renewed.
The ýhonourable gentleman from Saskatzhewan spoke about the navigability of the
Hudson Bay. The tides up there run at
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

times as fast as nine miles an heur. The
surface ice may be travelling at that speed,
with the tide, but the icebergs, which draw
anywhere from 400 to 600 feet, are in another
current. You can hear them roaring five or
six miles away, and they are called growlers.
Every sailor knows that the tide changes on
top before it changes below. The surface
ice mav be moving with the incoming tide,
aided perhaps by a favourable wind, and meet
icebergs that are being carried along by the
tide from below. What would happen to a
ship caught in that kind of thing? It would
be the last of her. And it must be remembered that there is a change of tide four times
a day.
D'Iberville, as I said before, went up there
in 1684. and he continued going there until
1696, when he wrote to the King of France:
"Sire, give me something else to do. I am
sick and tired of taking Hudson Bay." So the
King sent him down to Louisiana, where he
lost his life. It is true that for over three
hundred years sailors have been going in and
out of Hudson Straits, but they are not
practicable for commercial navigation. I have
no grudge against the route, and wish it were
satisfactory. However, any honourable member who so desires may go to Montreal and
ask Mr. Reford, of the Reford Line, or anyone
connected with the White Star Line, or the
Canadian Pacifie Steamships, whether they will
charter a steamer to go up there, and they
will say, "We will Jet you have a steamer if
you will pay for it before it leaves here, and
if it comes back safely we shall refund your
money, less the charter charges." It is impossible to get insurance on an ordinary
passenger steamer from Montreal to Churchill and back; and even if insurance could be
obtained, the cost would be prohibitive.
I am sorry that I have taken so much time
on this subject. I did not expect that my
honourable friend would be speaking this
evening, but since he did se, I did not like to
let the debate go by default.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Horner, the debate
was adjourned.

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 22, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Barnard for the second reading
of Bill A, an Act with respect to Hospital
Sweepstakes.
Hon. H. C. HOC.KEN: Honourable members, I understand that the principle of this
Bill has been discussed on several occasions,
but as--for reasons which you all know-I
did noV then have the privilege of speaking
on the question, I should like Vo express my
opinion to-night.
I have no doubt that the subject of lotteries
bas been very thoroughly discussed and I
shahl deal with only two aspects of the principhe involved. In the first place, I firmly
behieve that Vo alhow lotteries Vo be conducted in this country wouhd have a very
demoralizing effect on our people. Under the
Crimînal Code it is an offence Vo conduct a
lottery. Evîdently the prohibition is noV
based on moral grounds, hecause exceptions
are made in favour of lotteries conducted for
religious or charitable purposes, and therefore
I purpose Vo argue the question purely from
the social standpoint. I can remember when
the State authorîties of Louisiana conducted
a lottery every month for the laudable purpose of providing funds for education. This
had a very demoralizing effect noV only on
every state of the Union, but on this Dominion as welh. In factories and other places
uhere men assembled for work you would
find these tickets being offered for sale each
month, and those who couhd not afford ten
dollars for a whole ticket were tempted Vo
buy a tenth of a ticket. Sometimes the ticketholder won a prize, but flot very oftcn. Ultimatehy the gambling craze reached such
serious proportions that the Federal Government of the United States was forced Vo override the authority of Louisiana and discontinue the lottery.
I have had sufficient sense Vo refrain from
gambling, but my observation, extending over
înany years, bas convinced me that lotteries
are one of the most demorahizing forms of
gambling. I know of mnen holding good positions who waste their entire substance on
gambling. Perhaps its most pernicious formi is
the buying of stocks on margin; but lotteries

86

SENATE

are pretty nearly as bad. Bearing in mind
what happened in the United States, I think
it would be a very great mistake to give this
Bill second reading. If it became law, lotteries
would not be confined to the province of
British Columbia: all the other provinces
would have to conduct lotteries in self-protection, and the whole country would be
demoralized.
But apart from this side of the question,
will the sanctioning of lotteries result in any
The
substantial benefit to our hospitals?
Irish Hospital Sweepstakes are frequently cited
as an effective means of raising funds for
hospitals. It may interest honourable members to know that many hospitals in the Irish
Free State have refused to take part in the
proceeds of those lotteries, and they do so
advisedly, because, as the honourable member
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said
the other day, such lotteries discourage contributions and bequests from chariitably
disposed persons. But that is not the only
drawback, as this extract from the Irish
Times, of Dublin, would indicate:
Although the Cork South Infirmary bas been
in the Free State sweepstakes froin the start,
its financial condition is now serious, for
voluntary subscriptions are down to the vanishing point, and the Free State Government for
two years has delayed payment of sweepstakes
noney. At a meeting of the committee of the
hospital the treasurer said they owed their
bankers £3.249, and the position at the end of
the year would lie impossible, as they would be
£5,000 to the bad.
From this it is evident that the hospital
sweepstakes in the Free State have not
accomplished the purpose for which they were
inaugurated; otherwise the Cork South Infirmary would be in a good financial position.
But in any case a very small proportion
of the receipts go to the hospitals. As
I have said, I agree with the honourable
senator from Montarville that the institution
of lotteries would tend to discourage charitable
gifts to our hospitals, and that as a result
these institutions would suffer substantial
financial loss. But apart altogether from this
probability, I submit we should take
cognizance of the demoralizing effect of
lotteries and decline to approve a measure of
this kind. I am not arguing that it is sinful
to gamble, but it is an exceedingly silly
practice. A lottery can never work out to
the advantage either of those who buy
tickets or of the institution for whose supposed
benefit it is conducted. I sincerely hope that
the Bill will be rejected.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Murdock, the debate was adjourned.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN.

PRECIOUS METALS MARKING BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 2, an Act to amend
the Precious Metals Marking Act, 1928.
He said: Honourable senators, I owe it to
the House now to make a brief explanation
of the Bill. I may add at once that it is
intended to refer the Bill to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. This is not a
highly important measure. As honourable
members know, the Parliament of Canada,
having jurisdiction in matters of trade and
commerce, seeks to regulate in this respect,
at least to the extent necessary to prevent
what savours of fraud, if it is not indeed
actual fraud, in the sale and purchase of certain goods. It is impossible for the ordinary
purchaser of precious metals to say just what
is the composition of the article that he is
buying, and consequently the original Act
provides that when any ornament or article
made from the precious metals is sold under a
certain nomenclature, it must be of the
character specified. If, for example, it is sold
as gold plated, there must be a certain percentage of gold in the plate. This in general
is the purpose of the Precious Metals Marking Act. The present Bill does not in any
degree extend the principle of the original
Act. It restates the law, mostly for the purposes of clarification. It goes further in certain respects, as to mountings upon jewelry
and some other apparently not very important
features. In the main the inspectors who
enforce the law deem the proposed amendments necessary in order to prevent certain
technical infringements.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: For instance, an
article of sterling silver quality must b so
stamped.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes; not only
that, but the dealers or manufacturers must
themselves vindicate the stamp.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Since 1928, in
the Banking and Commerce Committee, we
have given careful study to similar bills, and
I am glad my right honourable friend is
suggesting that this Bill should go to the
select committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I submit that public
bills should be considered by Committee of
the Whole. We have got into the bad habit
of referring public bills to select committees.
Every member is supposed to be interested
in a public bill and to know something about
it. I should like the right honourable gentle-

FEBRUARY 27, 1934
man, who has done so much to raise the
standard of this Bouse, to let us know
whether as a rule public bis should nlot ho
deailt with as I have suggested. After a publie
bill has been consi.dered in Committee of the
Whole, we could, if necessary, send it to a
select committee in order to get expert opinion
on the measure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGBEN: Does the
honourable member mean that a public bill
is first of ail deait with in Comrnittee of the
Whole, and after being reported is, if deemed
necessary, referred to a select committee?
Bon. Mr. CA.SGRAIN: No; it is deait with
here in the Bouse.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGBEN: 1 know,' but
it is not correct to say that public bills are
dealt with only in Committee of the Whole.
For exanmple, in either Bouse of Parliament
it would nover be considered improper that
the revision of the Bank Act should be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. A select committee should deal
with measures of that character, and I think
it sbould deal with this measure. I take it
that the report of the committee, which is
made after the second -reading, in no way
prevents the measure fromn being referred to
Committee of the Whole before third reading.
Bon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It always depends
on the motion of this Bouse. The Bouse can
do what it likes.
Right Hon. Mr. METOBEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I was calling the
attention of the right honourable leader to
what I consider is the proper practite, that
public bills should be deait with in this Bouse.
Would it flot be well for us to revert to the
old customi of deahling with public bills in
Committee -of 'the Whole? Then, if we found
it necessary, we could refer them to select
committees to secure further information from
outside sources. I amn merely suggestingth
propriety of this course.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Any public
bilis will be referred to Committee of tbe
Whole if such is the desire of honourable
members. But the question I was puttingand I arn not certain yet wbat the right
answer should be-is whether or not the
reference of a public bill to, Committee of
the whole should precede or follow the
reference to the select committee.
I have not
Bon. Mr. DAN'DURAND:
recently read the rules relating to this matter,
but I may state what has been the practice
for a number of years.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGBEN: I know the
practice in the Bouse of Gommons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When I was
responsible for Government legisiation in this
Bouse my practice was this. If a Bill
presented to the Bouse conitained anything:
of a technical nature, or anything requiring
technical advice, wbich would be much more
easily secured by sending the Bill to a standing commi'ttee, I neyer hesitated to suggest
that it should go 'there first.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGBEN: That is what
I think.
Then twentyBon. Mr. DANDURAND:
five or f orty or fifty memrbers of the Senate
had the advantage of first-hand information
from men in the department who had drafted
the Bill. When the Bill was returned to the
Senate it could be sent to, Committee of the
Whole if furtber discussion was deemed desîrable, or if further amendments were to be
considered. Did we not last year send the
Railway Bill to the Standing Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs and Barbours in order
to secure evidence which could not be obtained hiere? 1 know of many Bills in regard
to which it was thought desirable to secure
information directly fromn the experts of the
department that had to do with the drafting
of the Bill. There was the Pension Bill, for
instance. We had been operating since 1867,
I think, under three special Acts, and were
consolidating those Acts in order to deal with
pensions fromn a certain date iinder a new
system. With the exception of three or four
honourable gentlemen who had given special
study to the matter, no one would have dared
to enter into a discussion of the Bill in Coinmittee of the Whole. After the Committee
on Banking and Commerce had spent three
or four days over the Bill, and had heard the
experts of various departmnents, and the
ýSuperintendent of Insurance. we were in a
position to, discuss it intelligently in this
Chamber. I do not think anyone can point
to a rule directing us to send a Bill to Coinmittee of the Whole before sending it to a
select- committee. I think that matter is in
the hands of the Bouse.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGBEN:- 1 think the
procedure outlîned by the honourable gentleman (Bon. Mr. 'Dandurand) is the proper
procedure, and it is the one which was
followed in the Bouse of Commons, with
whose practice I amn much more familiar than
I arn with that of this Bouse. The right of
every member of this Bouse to, insist that a
public Bill ho committed to the Committee

SENATE
of the Wliole is undoubted, but it seems to
me only rational that that stage should follow
commitment to a select committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If the right honourable gentleman will read May or Bourinot,
or even Flint, he will find it repeated again
and again that the whole House is supposed
to deal with public bills.
Oh, no.
Rlight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
What is the Private Bills Committee for,
except to deal with Private Bills? Surely
the Committee on Banking and Commerce
is not appointed only for the purpose of dealing with Private Bills or a Railway Bill.
The Bank Act.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
a Private Bill. It would be dealt with in
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

THE WORLD DEPRESSION AND
UNREST
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. J. J. HUGHES rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the declarations of the Prime Minister and
the right honourable Leader of the Liberal
Party in regard to the probable cause or causes
of the world depression. unrest and confusion
and the remedy for these ills; and vill enquire
whether

the

Goveronment

contemplates taking

any further steps calculated to mitigate these
conditions or to ward off, as far as possible,
their effects upon Canada.
He said: Honourable members, a reading of
the notice standing in my name will serve
as an introduction to the remarks that I intend to make.
Some time ago the Prime Minister, after
reviewing general conditions, declared with
emphasis that "only the grace of God can
save the world"; and a little later the right
honourable Leader of the Liberal Party, at
the close of a reasoned speech, stated, "The
principles of the Sermon on the Mount would
save the world." These were not ordinary
Rightl Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

statements; they contain much food for
thought. As I see it, the fact that the leaders
of both historie political parties should hold
and give expression to such fundamental
beliefs at this time means much for Canada,
and I consider it a privilege, and perhaps a
duty, to give heed to such expressions, examine
their implications, and as far as practicable
draw useful rules of conduct from them.
Embedded in them is the Christian conception
of life. We cannot help noticing, however,
that the governing bodies of many nations are
using their legislative, executive and judicial
powers to erase, as far as possible, this coneeption from the minds of their people, particularly the young, and are carrying their
propaganda into other countries. It would
seem, therefore, to be the duty of aill those
who believe that civilization itself rests upon
the fundamental principles of Christianity to
combat this growing menace of Communism,
Nazi-ism, or whatever it may be cailed, whenever, wherever and however it shows itself.
As I understand it, the Christian explanation of the creation, t-he fall and the redemption is as follows: When man was created
the angels were given various ministries in
his regard, and to Lucifer was given much
power on this earth. When he rebelled and
was expelled from heaven his relationship
with God was broken, his name was changed
to Satan, his nature became changed, he
became wholly bad and nevermore could do
any good. But all his attributes were not
taken from him. He was still a spirit with
great knowledge and considerable power. He
wanted a kingdom; he wanted subjects, and
he coveted man. He concentrated against
Adam and won, and man would have been
wholly and completely lest if the Second Person of the Trinity had not come to his rescue
and saved him by Himself becoming man,
and in His person overcoming all evil. When
Our Saviour was on this earth He called
'Satan the Prince of this world; and Satan,
knowing Him to be a man, tried to tempt
'Him by offering Him all the possessions he
had, or once had, and over which lie still
exercised large control. This is one of the
ways in which Satan has always tempted
and still tempts men and nations, and he has
nearly always met with great success. Riches,
honour, glory, dominion make a strong appeal
to individual pride and greed, and a still
stronger appeal to national pride and greed.
This appeal forms probably the subtlest and
most dangerous of all tempt-ation. Response
to it may appear to the individual as the
-neans of obtaining a reward for his personal
merits, and to the nation as the pursuit of

FEBRUARY 28, 1934
duty and patriotism. It leads to every effort
on the part of the individual to overreach, outwit and exploit his neighbour in all wordly
transactions; it leads to jealousies, to hatreds,
to wars, physical and commercial, and to all
manner of intrigues on the part of nations.
If all men fell for it the world would be
turned into a hell upon earth; and, conversely,
if all men observed the principles of the
Sermon on the Mount the world would be
turned into a heaven, upon earth. We are
assured by God Himself that no man will ever
be tempted beyond his strength, even though
he be assailed by powers and principalities,
and that he will be given what help he needs
if he ask for it as a child speaks to its father.
In the light of this assurance we see the true
meaning and the value of the declarations of
the Prime Minister and the Right Honourable
Mr. King.
In the Sermon on the Mount this principle
is laid down: " All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you,
do you also to them." This declaration by
Jesus is both clear and comprehensive. Tomes
have been written on social legislation and
social justice which do not contain as much
wisdom and practical truth as are embodied
in this sentence, and it is as easily understood
by the man on the street as by the professor
in the university. Then why is it ignored by
the world, and laughed at by many? Well,
the reason is that the world is not Christian.
It might be wrong to say that it is antichristian; it would probably be more correct
to say that it is unchristian, because for this
there is a great deal of proof.
We have all kinds of conferences and
gatherings of men to discuss national and
international affairs, but so far as the records
go, or so far at all events as I have been able
to read them, the name of God is never
seriously mentioned at any of these gatherings, and no real effort is made to ascertain
God's will in regard to any of the weighty
matters discussed thereat. If this is not a
withdrawing of the intellect from the light of
faith and therefore from conformity to God's
will, if it is not a public manifestation of
materialism and atheism, I do not know what
it is. If God allowed this kind of thing to
succeed, would it not confirm the world in
its materialistie and atheistic attitude? And
would that not be a greater affliction than a
continuance and a deepening of the depression? As I see it, we should thank God for
this depression, particularly if it causes men
to think. "With desolation is all the land
made desolate; because there is none that
thinketh in his heart." The pagan society of

89

the old Roman Empire was bitterly antichristian, hence the fierce persecutions of the
first three centuries of the Christian era. At
last God's judgment fell, and the Empire
disappeared. The cities that flourished in the
valley of the Nile and on the shores of the
eastern Mediterranean, in the pre-Christian
era, were ungodly and abounded in moral
depravity. They disappeared, and to-day the
spade of the archaeologist is uncovering their
ruins. God is the moral governor of the
universe and will not be mocked. "Man does
not live by bread alone."
The unchristian state of the world will not
likely be permanent. It is probable that it
will either revert to Christianity or become
antichristian, and in that case history may
repeat itself. There may be great movements
going on outside of the mind of man; the
powers and the principalities of evil are not
idle; but the mercy of God is very great, and
this depression may be a manifestation of that
mercy. If the world were Christian, if even
Christendom were Christian, God would be
not only admitted but welcomed everywhere.
He would be in the halls of legislation, in the
halls of justice, in the halls of education, in
the market place, in the counting houses, in
the factories, on the farms, and at all the
national and international gatherings of men.
But such is not the case. Instead, a widespread, determined effort is being made to
establish a cult or a religion which would
make man sufficient unto himself, dependent
on no being outside of himself. This temptation is very flattering to human pride and is
as old as Eden. If it succeeded it would drive
God out of the world, which He created and
which, by the creative act, He sustains during
every moment of its existence. Therefore it
cannot succeed, but man in making the effort
to drive God out of the world may destroy
himself.
On the editorial page of the Montreal
Gazette of to-day there is an article by Professor W. Caldwell, in which this sentence
occurs:
The one supreme lack to-day in Europe is
the absence of any real intellectual and moral
anthority in resnect of what has been accomplished by the War in the way of the liberation of the people most immediately concerned, and in the consequences to which this
leads.
As I see it, the greatest human problems
before the world to-day are, what to do with
the debts of the world, and what to do with
the private armament manufacturers. Nearly
all the other nations of the world are in debt
to the United States. And alil the entities

90

SENATE

and nearly all the individuals in the world
are overwhelmingly in debt to somebody or
something. I am certain these colossal debts
will never be paid, because they cannot be
paid. Practically speaking, the world is bankrupt, morally and financiailly, and it appears
to lack both the intelligence and the courage
to face this fact. If these debts, principal or
interest, or both, were scaled down to a figure
that would be possible to pay, it would be
more advantageous to the creditors than even
to the debtors. But if this large scaling-down
is beyond the wit and power of man, and if
the governments are unable or unwilling to
eliminate the private armament manufacturers, who are the efficient agents of Satan,
Europe, or indeed the Caucasian race, is
doomed to perish, or go through greater
troubles than any we have yet experienced.
The United States is the most self-contained,
the most industrialized and the most highly
mechanized nation on the earth. It made
billions out of the War, yet it is suffering as
much as the war-torn bankrupt nations, and
thiýs fact surely proves that 'the bankers, the
economists and the statesmen have net yet
discovered the real cause or causes of the
depression.
Both ex-President Hoover and
President Roosevelt have tried to stem the
deluge of crimes sweeping over their country,
but without much success. Within the past
year several lynchings of a shocking character
took place in many States of the Union, and
at these murders many of those called the
best people were present. Even mothers were
present, and in some cases held their children
high in their arms to let them see what was
going on. And the Governor of California
publicly commended these crimes and declared that if any of the perpetrators were
convicted by the courts and sent to prison,
he would pardon them. Within the year I
read in the papers of the killing of a leading
gangster in Chicago by a rival gang. The
murdered man got almost a state funeral.
He was buried in a bronze coffin costing some
$1,500. Several carloads of flowers followed
his remains to the eemetery. But worse than
all, four or five judges were honorary pallbearers at his funeral. The dead man when
living had done much to elect those men to
the bench. We may see some material improvement in the United States, but material
prosperity will not save the nation in which
the lawfully constituted authorities commend
and protect mob violence and mob killing,
and justice is contaminated at its source. In
fact, material prosperity may increase and
accentuate such depravity, may give opportunities for committing many other crimes,
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

and may thus hasten the destruction of the
nation. Material prosperity, like easy credit,
may do much harm in the hands of thoughtless people. Rich, powerful individiuals and
rich, powerful nations may have established
a partnership they would be much better
withou't. And nations are not like individuals;
if they are punished at all, it must be in
this world. They begin and end here.
During the holding of the Liberal-Conservative summer school at Newmarket,
Ontario, ýlast year, the Prime Minister of
Canada declared that education must necessarily be the principal means to ensure the
hope and stability of democracy. By "democracy" I presume he meant the political institutions and civilization of many countries
in Europe and America. I feel sure he means
well. He speaks vigorously enough, but he
does not always speak thoughtfully enough,
and the declaration cited is proof of that fact.
If Mr. Bennett will examine his premises for
a moment he will surely admit that there are
two kinds of education, the right kind and the
wrong, and that a great deal of the instruction given in the world to-day is net worthy
of the name of education. For instance, Mr.
Philip E. Wentworth, a graduate of Harvard
University, in an article in the Atlantic
Monthly of June, 1932, stated that two years
at Harvard had made him a Unitarian or a
non-Christian, and four years there had made
him an atheist; that nine young men and
women out of every ten who graduate from
the universities of the United States are
atheists. These statements were not questioned by any of the secular universities in
that country.
Surely Mr. Bennett, upon
reflection, would not say that that kind of
education would save democracy, or anything
else -worth saving. It is a well known fact
that previous to the Great War the secular
universities of Germany were hotbeds of infidelity and atheism. Nevertheless, Germany
was regarded as the schoolhouse of the world,
and rich families everywhere sent their sons
to that country to finish their education. Did
such education establish or save democracy
in Germany?
Then there is the kind of
education imparted in Russia at the present
time. I am sure Mr. Bennett does not
approve of it. But one, at least, of our
Rhodes scholnars approves of it, and this man
is a clergyman in good standing in one of
our large Christian denominations and a professor of Christian ethies in one of our
colleges. Should not this be enough to make
the Prime Minister and every thoughtful
Canadian ask, "Whither are we drifting?" If
we are Christians at all, and do any think-

FEBRUARY 28, 1934
ing, we mugt conclude that three4ourths or
four-flfths of what pamfes in the world 'to-day
for education is made up of imoperfeet knowledge and intellectual pride; is obviously and
confessedly materialistie and unchristian or
antichristian, and is therefore, in the opinion
of many, a large factor in the world's undoing.
The intellect perverted in any way distorts principles, judgments and laws. And
twenity errors in practice are as nothing compared with one error in principle. Twenty
errors in practice may be corrected and the
twenty-first may neyer be committed; but
one erroneous princile is like a damaged
wheel in a machine-the machine can neyer
work correctly afterwards tili the wheel is
repaired or replaced. One speculative error
may produce an infinite series of practical
errors, because mind dominates- matter and
the spiritual or eternal controls the temporal.
"'As a man thinketh in his heart so is he."
And "The thoughts of to-day are the actions
of to-morrcow." I think this expresses the
views held by the Prime Minister and the
Rigiht Honiourable Mr. King when they
used the words quoted at the beginning of my
remarks.
As I look out over the world, fram. my very
limited viewpoint, I see two organizations,
namely the Catholic Church and the British
Empire, which challenge rny attention. Both
these organizations have visible, permanent
heads, matured laws and well ordered liberty
without licence. These matured laws and well
ordered, well regulated liberty are founded
upon, and muat be founded upon, the principle of graded autbority. In all our relations wibbh our fellow men this principle must
be recognized. You cannot have even a
properly conducted debatîng society in a
croe&-roads country scboolbouse without a
chairman, whose .rulings, for the time being,
are absolute; and from that you go u~p to the
Privy Council in England for final decisions.
To prevent chaos in the State, there must be
a court of last resort and it mnust he compoged of a visible man or visible men. The
statute laws of Great Britain are as clearly
written as trained, intelligent men could write
them. But wbat would happen if these laws
were put into the hands of every man and
he were told to interpret tihem for himsef?
The imagination could hardly picture the
confusion that would ensue. Again, the Constitution of the United States was as clearly
written as trained, intelligent men couki write
it. Whet would happen if it were put into
the hands of everw man in the United States,
and he were told to interpret it for himSbf?
I leave your imagination to supply the
answer. A court had to be established to

91

interpret the Constitution, that court had to
he coterminous wibh the Constitution, and
will have to, function while the Republic
encdures. These illustrations are ail conflned
to the temporal order, but are they not
applicable to the spiritual order as well? God
is the author of both orders, and human
nature is the same in both.
If the troubles through which I hope the
world is successfuliy passing were a new thing
in our existence, many m.ight see littie hope
of improvement in the future, but, dark and
foreboding as the situation is to-day, it is
not as dark as it was during the firet Good
Friday afternoon; it is not as dark as it was
during many periods of the flrst three centuries
of the Christian era, and it is not as dark as
it was during nearly the wbole period of the
pre-Christian era. Satan, or Antichrist, may
win many batties, or even caanpaigns; but
he wiil not win the war, because he is Satan.
On the other hand, God will not be driven out
of the world which He created and which,
by the creative act, He sustains during every
moment of its existence, because He is God.
is triumph will be complete, and as visible
as, perhaps more Yisible than, it was on the
flrst Easter Sunday morning.
The true Christian will neyer despair. He
is as certain of God's existence, and ail it
means, as he is of his own. In fact, if God
did flot exist, he himself would be a monstrosity, namely an effect without a cause.
And the essence of religion, and the essence
of common sense as well, even in temporal
matters, consists in a proper reiationship between God the Creator in heaven and man
the creature on earth. W-hile man is willing
to serve, a relationship is maintained; but
when man, through pride or greed, or for any
other cause, wilfully and deliberately rebels
and tells God he will not serve Him any
longer, the relationship is broken, and the
rebel must take the consequences. The man
who stands right with God and bis neighbour
bas solved all the prohlems of iife, so far
as 'he is concerned, and the principles and
practices that save an individual will save a
nation or a world, if applied.
According to my .reading and some observation, many non-Christians admit tbat Jesus
was tbe greatest preacher, the greatest teacber,
tbe greatest moralist, the greateat social
worker, the sanest and most practical man
that ever lived. It is strange, therefore, tbat
these same people do not; aecept Hlim as
leader, but turn to Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin
and other confessedly inferior persons. For
professing Christians to accept any leader
other than Jesus is incomprebensible to ordinary minds. Man is a paradox: be possesses

1 shaHl close these remarks by a brief quotation from a short ehapter in "Philosophy of
the Bible Vindicated," by the late Archbishop
O'Brien of Halifax. The quotation is as f ollows:

In the race of life those who have heen

this time add to the space that intervenes
between the swif t and the slow; it multiplies
the power of the gifted in contrast with the
slow labours of those wbo are handicapped in
one way or another. The inability to succeed
which fiormerly prevailed is now intensified ta
a tremendous degree. The resuit is that we

poverty of those who are deprived of means

there was some other way, more to our taste
and liking. Certainly it is not to my liking
to handicap the energetic, the enterprising and
the bard-working, but it seems to me that
social legislation of the future will proceed
along that course, and that we must mnake up
our minds that this will be necessary if we are
ta have tolerably safe conditions for the fabric
of socîety. I helieve it -is a corollary that in
these times our laws must be directed to the
encouragement of consumption and the distribution of employment by a shortening of
hours of labour; that our taxes should he
directcd towards surplus earnings year by year,
so that the spending of what we bave may be
encouraged, and in order that by immediate
spending and consumption the world's wealth
may be devoted to giving employment rather
than increasing investments.
I do flot intend to dilate furtber upon this
idea at the present time, but if honourable
gentlemen think out the subjeet 'they will
be, I believe, better prepared for legislation
that is bound to come-not this year, perhaps,
but in the flot far distant future-legislation,
may I add, which in already foreshftdowed by
the political trends of more than rne other
nation in the world. 1 believe that the special

I think it wouid not be unfair to put upon
the record the contents of a circubar letter
whîch I received the other day, as I presume
ail other honourahie members did. It is on
the stationery of tbe Social Service Council
of Canada, 37 Binor Street West, Toronto, and
is dated February 12, 1934. The names of the
officers of the Association are stated, and the
letter is signed by the Generai Secretary of
the Council, Rev. J. Pbiilips Jones, M.A., D.D.
1 notice that this Social Service Council
apparently envers the iength and breadth nf
Canada. The letter reads:
Honourahîle and Dear Sir:
In view of the fact that an Act to legalize
Hospital Sweepstakes bas passed its first reading ini the Senate of Canada, the Social Service
Connecil of Canada respectfully draws your

FEBRUARY 28, 1934
attention to the report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries and Betting issued in
London, England, in 1933.
That report quotes -the resolution of the
British Hospital Association, which states:
"That the British Hospital Association i
not in favour of the amendment of the law
affecting public sweepstakes, which purports to
be for the benefit of voluntary hospitals."
Recent figures in connection with the Irish
sweepstakes for hospitade, extending from 1931
to 1933, make clear that:
1. Hospitals received only one-seventh of the
amount wagered.
2. Prize money equalled approximately onehalf.
3. The balance went to the sellers and to
"expenses."
That is, 21 went to hospitals, 7/14 to prize
money, and M4 to sel'lers and overhead.
In arriving at its findings the Commission
states tha;t "whiile gambling eamong private
individuale should not be interfered with,
organized gambling facikities shouldi be prohibited or restricted where these facilities lead
to serions social consequenoes."
In view cf these considerations, the Commission reached the following conclusions:
1. "That the institution of large lotteries in
this country (Great Britain) is not recommended. Such a step is undesireible in itself,
and unlikely to assist, very materielily in
su.ppressing the sale in this country of tickets
in lotteries promoted elsewhere."
2. "Ilhe existing general prohibition in this
country of all lotteries, whebher promnoted here
or abroad, should be maintained, and the law
against foreign and 'ilegal 'lotteries should be
strengthened."
Certain legislation is recommended to give
effect to the prohibition of lotteries, end under
the Lottery Act the court shouid forfeit to the
state any money or valuable thi.ng conneoted
with the proceeds of a foreign or illegal
lottery.
Certein exceptions recommended from the
general prohibition of lotteries deal with art
union direwings, privaite lotteries proposed in
clubs, and smaîl public latteries incidentail to
bazaars and sales of work. under certain condi:tione. "No exception shouldi be made however, in favour of small publie lotteries or
prize drawings in which the public in general
are invi.ted to pu.rohase tickets."
In view of the findings of this Royal Commission whdeh deale with the whole subjeot of

lotteries and other forms of gambl'ing, and
which points out the disastrous social and
moral effeots of lotteries upon the moree of
the nation in a time cf finanoid strain, the
the nation is a time of financial strain, the
Social Service Council of Canada strongly
urges that the bill for Hospital Sweepstakes
be not paessed. The Royal Commission by its
findings states that Hospital Sweepstakes are
not in the best interests of Great Britain.
Why then should thev be considered in the
best interests of Canada?
Yours on behalof e! he Social Service Council
of Canada.
J. Phliips Jones,
General Secretairy.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Does that

letter represent the public feeling of the whole
country, from one end to the other, or is it

merely an expression of opinion by a society?
Hon. Mr. ýMURDOCK: My honourable
friend is in just as good a position as I
am to answer that question. I tried to be
rather explicit in indicating where this letter
came from. I have no doubt my honourable friend would regard it as being worse
than useless, as he has the right to do, and

I am only giving it as the expression of
opinion of the Social Service Council of
Canada. It may be ithat my honourable
friend is not concerned about or symupathetic

towards the Social Service Council e! Canada,
but that does not alter the fact that this
organization, which presumably represents
tens of thousands of reputable and responsible

citizens of Canada, bas seen fit to send out
the letter I have rend, a copy of which was
no doubt sent to my honourable friend as
well as to me.
The Ottawa Citizen of this morning carries
an article, under the heading " M'any Families
at Toronto on Partial Relief," which tempts

me to digress for a moment.

It points out

that some wage-earners, married men who are

heads of families, are receiving from their
employers in Toronto $10 a week or less, and

are securing from the Relief Department of
that great city seme additional money to
enable them

to maintain the health, hap-

piness and well-being of themeelves and their
dependents. I happened to sit in and listen
to the testimony given before a commi-ttee of
another House yesterday, and thirty-eight
Toronto firms were specifically mentioned as

paying employees engaged in various forms of
industrial activity such a pittance that the
city, through the ta:payers, had to come to
their relief.
Thiat, in my humble judgment, is an exact
illustration of the kind of thing that is proposed by the Bill now under consideration, an

Act with respect to Hospital Sweepstakes.
Last year the honourable senator froin Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) andl this year the
honourable senator from Victoria (Hon. Mr.

Barnard) advocated the establishment of lotteries as a means of securing fundu to meet
the expenses of hospitals, to keep such institutions up-to-date and to enable them to do
work which the cause of humanity demande
should be done for those who are in need
of it, if we are te live up to the teaching
that eaoh man is his brother's keeper. Now,
what is the difference, I ask, between shirking
our responsibility for digging down into our
pockets for the necessary money to keep the
hospitals functioning properly, and the em-

of gambling which in my 'humble judgment is
altogether undesîrable for this country, and I
do flot think for one moment that the principle will be endorsed by the elected representatives of the people.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN:
bonourable gentleman just one question? Arn
I Tight in understanding him to say that the
banks reduced the interest on deposits to two
and a haif per cent?
Hon. Mr. MURDOOX: I do flot think I
used the word "reduced." I said the hanks
had placed their interest rate at two and a
haif per cent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The banks themselves?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: I was under the
impression that the Government was responsible for the reduotion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As I understand,
under their charters the banka have the right
to fix the rate of intereat. For a number of
years the bank interest was flxed at three per
cent; at present it is 2à per cent.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Not when you borrow 1
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No; but that is all
you get on your deposits. This being the
case, why in these tirnes of adversity should
not every bondholder be satisfled with a return
of two and a haîf per cent on bis securities?
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable mernberes, my inclination to support this Bill is
somewbat strengtbened by the very eloquent
speech to which we bave just listened.
Hlon. Mr. MURDOCK:- I knew that.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I had the privilege
cf receiving a copy of t>he circuler fromn the
Social Service Council quoted by my honourable friend. I read it very carefully, and I
must confess it did not convince me that tbe
IBill should be conternned and rejected. We
know that the same Social Service Council
for many years. presented. just as strenuous
arguments s.gainst repeal of prohibition. From
tirne to time I used to receive circulars; from
the Council pointîng out that tbe country
would go down to certain damnation if prohibition was not upheld. But in every province of the Dominion, sa well' as in the great
country on the other side of the boumdary
line, after experimenting witb prohibition the
people came to the conclusion that it bad
none of the virtues whieh the Social Service
Council claimed for it. Therefore I arn very

97

doubtful about accepting their adsvice in
regard to sweepstakes. The fact of the matter
is that, notwithstandi-ng the report by tbe
Royal Comrmission appointed by the British
Qovernmerit to investigate the question,
9weepetake tickets are being bought as freely
as ever in Girea't Britain% and ju.st s much
rnoney is pouring into the coffere of the Irish
Hospitals Trust. This bringe me to the conclusion tbat, as it was hopeless to attempt to
make people sober by prohibition legisiation,
so it is futile for the Social Service Council
or anyr other organization to say that by
legislation people have been prevented from
buying sweepstake tickets. Borne influence
other than legislation wiil have to, be brought
to bear to effeot the desired change in public
opinion. In fact, in ny judgment, probibitory legîslation in regard to the buying of
sweepstake tickets is the niost demoralizing
legislation. imaginable. The dernoralizing
effect, of such legislation cannot be ignored.
I would not venture to ask how many honourable niembers have sweepstake tickets in their
pockete just now.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I bave none.
Probably
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAMmost of the tickets bave been tomn up.
Hon. 'Mr. TANNER: We do know that
hundrede of thousands of Irish sweepstake
tickets are being sold every year, and that
indeed soine honourable members who last
session voted against a similar bill bad sweepstake tickets in their pockets, or at any rate
in their desks at homne.
&omne Hon. SENAoeORS: Name them.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do flot pretend to
say that persons who oppose this Bill are
not sincere, nor would I venture to say th-at
valid arguments cannot be advanced against
sweepstakes. But I arn convinced that there
is a sporting quality in the people of this
snd many other countries. Many persons
like to take a gambling chance, especially
our friends in the Old Country. What about
the Derby and ail the other great turf events
in England, and the dog racing there? Do
not the people gamble on the outcorne? 0f
course they do. They bet on everytihing.
An Hon. SENATOR: What about bridge?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: They bet on everything.
-Hon. Mr. MoMEÂNS: And loue.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Go I say you cannot
prevent garnbling. It is a part of our nature;
we are born with the garnibling spirit. For
rny part, I get more fun out of buying a

sweepstake ticket than I do out of aimost
anything eisecin lifo. I cnoM ail the pleasures
of anticipation; and if I lose, I lese cheerfully. I take a chance, as does everyone
else who buys a sweepstake ticket. Thero
are millions of persons just like myseif in
this resp)ect, and 1 suppose if we did flot
spend our money in this way we mi-lit waste
it on something perha.ps flot haif as, good.
In my opinion the proposai contained in
the Bill is a reasonabie proposai. 0f course,
iu the background is the question wbether this
Parliament reaily lias power to oust provincial
jurisdiction in the matter. That. is a constitutional question whirh I wvould refer to
my honourable friend from Regina (Hon.
Mr. Laird), who is known to ho an authority
on such matters. Ail this Bill purports to do
is to place on the Government of any of the
provinces
the responsibiiity of deciding
whiether or net sweepstakes shaii be conducted
within ils jurisdiction. Ordin-ariiy we are
wiihing to trust the discretion of the provincial goverroments.
Certainiy the provincial ciectorate have shown their confidence
in tlieir represeotatives. So why should we
hiesitate to emýpower any provincial government to say yea or nny in regard to the conduct of sweepstakes within ils boundaries?
I arn quiýte satisfiýed te leave the provinces to
clecide the question for thcmselves.
Some objection bias been urged against the
Bill on the ground that oniy a smali percentage of the proceeds of the Irish sweepstakes reaches member-hospitals of the Irish
Hospitails Trust. But it must be borne in
mind that the Bill gives the respective provincial governiments entire control in regard
te wliat percentage of the proceeds shahl be
devoted to prizes and to cost of management
and what proportion shahl he paid over to the
public institutions intended to be benefited,
and therefore ive are not to assume that oniy
one per cent or five per cent of the proceeds
wiil be devoted to charitable purposes. As a
motter uf fact, any provincial goveroiment, may
stipulate that fifty or even seventy-five per
cent of the proceeds shahl be turned over te
the hospitais and that oniy a rehativeiy smaii
percentage shahl be awarded te tbe tickethoiders in the forma of prizes. Io a word,
the Bill clothes the provincial authorities with
absolu te power in the motter.
Se, on the wboie, I arn satisfied te, vote for
this Bill.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Why pass it every
year if there is no chance of its getting through
the Huse of Commons?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Why? Because perseverance is the thing. By persevering we

may be able te drive common seose mbt
obtuse minds. Sec how long wve struggicd in
this House bofore wve succeeded-thanks te
the efforts of the honourable scooter from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans)-i 0 getting
a Court of Criminal Appeais erected in Canada. Year aftor year the House of Commons
threw eut the Bihl for tbat purpese, but finaliy
cemmon sense prevailed and the Bihl became
law.
The holding of lotteries is te be eptiona]
wvith the provinces.
A similar principlo is
alrea(Iy enîbodied in the Criminal Code of
the country. There we provide that at the,
op)tion of a municipal authority in any part
of Canada a iottery may ho held foc
religieus or philanthropie purposes. In the
eily, in the tewn, in the municipality, yen
cao set up a lottery.
The only thing I ever won at a iottery in
my life was a picture of my noble friend, long
deceascd, Daniel O'Connel], and I won it at
a cburcha entertainmont by tbrowing dice.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I nover felt any the
worse for that.
I have that picture yet.
AfteTwards, whien looking at the magnificent
monument of Daniel 0'Conneli in Dublin, 1
was giad te think I 'had a picture of him. at
home.
The principle of local option is settled right
in our statutes te day. If it is wrong te lot
a provincial governiment, institute a lottery
in a province, surely it is just as wrong te lot
a municipal couneil do se. If we are wrong
once wve are wrong twice; and if we are rigbt
once we shouid ho right twice. The prineiplo
hias been embodied in our statutes for many
years, and ail we are preposiog now is te
enlarge that principle, making it applicable
te a province, and te beave bbe motter with
the provincial geverniment.
Any honourabie, member can go te, Toronto,

and, in pursuance of the iaw passed by this
Parliament in 1912, cao spend ail the money

tickets on the herses as hoe likes. Is that right
or is it wrong? Are we ail wrong about this
thing? I see mon, women and cbiidren buying tickets at these race-courses. Is it wrong
or is it right?

We have made it

FEBRUARY 28, 1934
We start on a small soale in the town,
where we educate our children. At church
bazaars and entertainqnents you see the
youngsters selling tickets. We provide for
that in the law and say it is proper to teach
the children ta seil lottery tickets. We cannot get away f romn the fact that we have
practically been doing se ever since Confederation. But when these eidren grow up ta
be men and women we say te them, "This
selling of Iottery tickets is a bad thing, a
criminail thing; it cannot be tolerated."
We
should flot have taught these people in their
youtb that it is a good thing ta buy or sel
these tickets if we are going ta tell them
when they are grown up that it is ail wrong
and they should nlot do it.
A-s 1 have &said,
we have the pari mutuels
aI over the country, and it is a fact-perhaps
honourable members do nlot remember itthat within twelve months this Parliament,
wîthout an objection on the part of anybody,
created a new jockey race-course and
authorized the operation of the pari mutuel
for the further developrnent of garnhling in
this country. If honourable gentlemen wil
look up chapter 66 of the Statutes of 1933
they will find that we incorporated, and without a murmur of diss3ent ini either end of tihis
building, the Devonshire Jockey Club, which
took over the property of the Western Racing
Association, and we provîded riglit in. the Bill
that the rights of the club should be the same
as if it had been incorporated in 1912, so that
it could run pari mutuels and have gambling.

club had ta get the legislation which wae

Hon. -L. MoMEANS: Honourable mernbers,
I do not intend ta take up the time of this
House any longer than is necessary ta make
it clear that I arn taking the same stand that
I took last year. I arn voting for this Bill
solely on the ground that it concerns provincial rights. 1 arn not aware of any law that
prevents the holding of a lottery in any province of this Dominion. The Criminal Code
exacts a penalty for the running of lotteries,
but I do not know how that provision couid
be en-forced if any province made up its niind
that it was gaing ta permit them.
I arn not gaing ta discuss this question
frorn the moral point of view. I was braught
up ta believe in provincial rights. I do not
tbink this Bill legalizes lotteries in any way.
It may be that flot one province will take
advantage of it. Manitoba, I arn quite sure,
will not. Winnipeg is a strictly moral city.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN. "Oh, yeah?"
Same Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But thaît is no reason
why the province of Manitoba should have
anything ta say about wbat Quebec should do,
and I for anc would very much resent any
interference an the part of the great province
of Quebec as ta the way in which affairs are
conducted in the province of Manitoba. I
think the province of Quebec can run its own
affaiqs, and that the province of British
Columbia can do likewise.
As a representative from the province of
Manitoba I shaîl vote for any measure that
will give that province further jurisdiction.
Let the province exercise its powers how it
will, I arn going ta vote for provincial rights
every time.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: In a
measure I arn like my honourable friend who
bas just taken his seat, but I arn going ta
vote against this Bill. If this mensure is nat
necessary ta enable the provinces ta authorize
the carrying on of lotteries, then why bother
about it?

Hon. -Mr. MURDOCK: Was tbat nlot a
going concern under a permissive law of
Canada?

Hon. MT. MoMEANS: I said they would
have the right, 'but there is a provision in the
Criminal Code ta punish anyone for carrying
on a lattery.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: It is a going concern
because we passed a special law making the
Act of 1912 applicable te that company. And
my honourable friend frorn Parkdie (Hon.
Mr,. Murdock) never opened hie mouth in
opposition ta it, nor did anybody else.
That is all I bave ta say. I arn going ta
vote for the Bill.

Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: I think the
honourable gentleman intimated thut there
wauld be trouble in enforcing the provision
of the Crinainal Code, and that in combating
it the question of provincial rights might ho
successfully raised. If the honourable gentleman is for provincial rights, why does9 he nat
stand on them?

74728-7àj

SENATE

Like the honourable member from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock), I an not opposing this
Bill because of any feeling that I am better
than others. I cannot think of any normal
person who is not as good as 1.
I am probably as well aware of the condition of the hospitals, the municipalities, and
the provinces as anybody else. The condition
described as existing in Vancouver is conmon to every locality. Municipalities everywhere are finding it extremely difficult to contribute to the hospitals the funds necessary
for the maintenance of patients committed
to their care. Those of you who have anything to do with hospitals in a practical way
will readily understand the difficulty of the
situation at the present time. The municipalities are objecting to the practice, so frequently indulged in, of sending to the hospitals patients who could be looked after in
their own home. The committal of such
people to hospitals adds to the already great
burdens which the municipalities are called
upon to bear. I have every sym:pathy with
the hospitals, the municipalities and the provinces, but the Federal Parliament cannot very
well corne to the rescue of the provinces every
time they require assistance. We are going
a long way in that direction now, and in doing
so we are overstepping the bounds of the
Constitution.
We have heard men prominent in provincial
affairs suggesting a change in the Constitution. I am inclined to think that this suggestion is made because the provinces are
desirous of escaping some of the responsibilities they assumed at the time of Confederation. The obligation so far as hospitals
are concerned rests not with the Dominion of
Canada, but with the provinces and municipalities. I am not saying that in times like these
the federal authorities should not aid the
provinces or the municipalities, but I maintain that we should not rush in to assume, as
of right, responsibilities which under the Constitution do not belong to us, even though for
the time being we are assuming them as a
matter of generosity.
We are in a time of serious depression, the
effects of which are being felt by every institution; but I do not think we should attempt
to raise money by means of lotteries. It is
true that appeals on behalf of hospitals might
meet with a more favourable response than
appeals on behalf of other institutions. We
must not forget, however, that the money for
lotteries would come out of the pockets of the
people, a great majority of whorn ought to be
using it to buy bread and butter and to pay
their debts to the storekeeper. Men of means
do not indulge in lotteries to any great extent.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

In addition to imposing a burden on the
people-one which tbey would perhaps assume
v'oluntarily, aided and abetted, like the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), by their sporting instinct-loitteries
would deprive them of money that they should
spend in other ways. In nine hundred and
ninety-nine cases out of a thousand they
would never get back a farthing; nevertheless
they would keep on trying to recoup their
losses. That is not the kind of education that
our young people need.
The difficulties of the world to-day are due
in large measure to the desire of humanity to
make a living without working for it. You
may say this is not the same thing. But the
principle is the same. People who indulge in
lotteries are eager to gain a large sum of
money by a small expenditure. What we ought
to be drilling into the minds of our young
people to-day is the legitimacy of the old
theory of supply and demand, of working or
of giving value for what we get, instead of
expecting to get something for nothing. Now,
if we staid members of the Senate rush in to
show the boys how they can make a few
dollars without working for them, we shall be
encouraging something that bas had much to
do with the wrecking of the world's financial
structure. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) says that we have always attended
horse-races, and probably we always shall; but
when we do we see something. It is not so
with lotteries. We run to the stock exchange
and form pools, hoping that the price of some
stock will increase far beyond its real value,
and intending to sell it at an enhanced price
and in that way get something for nothing.
This is the spirit that has undermined the
business honesty of the world.
As a man getting up in years, I feel that I
ought to raise my voice against any such proposal as this, even though I admit the need
of the hospitals. It is the duty of the provinces and municipalities to maintain them, and
every time they try to evade that duty they
attempt to transfer it to some person or body
that is not at all responsible for these institutions.
The principle behind this Bill is wrong. I
do not wish to encourage anything that would
tend to educate the young men of this country
to do business in any other way than along the
line of good business principles. We have had
too much of the other kiind of thing and have
been in danger of becoming wrecked. I hope
that the Senate will act as it did two years
ago and defeat the measure.
Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: Honourable senators, I feel that perhaps at this late date I

FEBRUARY 28, 1934
cannot add very mucli to the discussion. The
Bill has been thoroughly debated, and I arn
sure we ail agree that the case for either side
bas been well presented. Personally I have
given a good deal of study to the question of
lotteries, and durîng a trip to France last
month I spent some time enideavouring to discover just wliat effect they had upon the
people of Paris. 1 may say that my observations confirma what lia just been stated by the
right lionourable senator from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham), that the people
who patronize the lotteries in that community
are flot members of the wealthiest classes, who
can afford to lose some money, but belong to
the poorer and working classes. In fact, honourahle senators, I was very unfavourably
impressed with the way in which the lotteries
are conducted in the city of Paris. I was
asked dozens of times on the boulevards to
buy tickets. Little stores and shops have
themn for sale, and the bait that is held out is
the possibility of large premiums being paid.
I presumne that the people on the streets who
asked me to buy these tickets receive a generous commission on their sales or they would
flot engage in that work.
I inquired from a number of persons in
Pa-ris whether they thouglit lotteries were beneficial to charitable institutions, and their answer was in the negative. They stated it was
an open secret that the cliarities liad suffered
from the loss of subscriptions which had been
diverted into the lottery channels. I particularly sought the opinion of tradespeople,
for I regarded their point of view as being
very important. Tliey strongly complained
that the lotteries had made such a drain upon
the money in circulation that business was slow
in consequence. They told me that comparatively poor people would spend one liundred
francs on the purchase of a chance in th2
natâonal gamble and go without some necessities of if e which tliey actually lacked.
Many a womnan who needs a new bat prefers
to buy two chances of winning a f ew francs,
witli the possibility of getting one of the lairge
prizes of five million francs, and accordingly
therp lias been a reduction in the expenditures
on mîllinery. The opinion expressed to me
was that from a commercial point of viewI amn not; discussing the moral or the religious
side of this question to-day-thie proprietors
of sliops and the working people are sadly
sufferîng by reason of the lotteries permitted
in the city of Paris.
Hon. G. LACASE: Honourable members,
I liad not intended to participate in thýis
debate, especially after tlie impasssioned plea
mnade by my honourable friend from Park-

101

dalle (Hon. Mr. Murdock) and the dispassionate one by the riglit honourable gentleman
from Eganville (Riglit Hon. Mr. Graham).
Their arguments, I appreciate, were well
expreoeed. But having consistently supported
this measure or a similar one in the last Vliree
sessions, I want to justify myself once more
in speaking and voting in favour of it.
I liad expected to hear before this the views
of the honourable meinbez f rom Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. MoRae), who sponsored the Bill
iast year. He is back wîtli us from Florida,
bearing on his tanined features the imprint
of the tropical sun and evidence of contact
witli the salty winds of the sea. Surely lie
wilI not fail to give bis views again before
this debate is concluded, to show us that lie
lias consisten-tly niaintained the attitude lie
voioed previously.
It has been said that the measure was
disastrous1y defeated in another place last
year. Well, the first and second times ouch
a Bill was brouglit up in the Senate it was
turned down too, and ju.st as definitely as it
was in the other House, but on the third
occasion of its appearance liere it was passed.
So that gives us ground for a little hope as
to wlist will be the fate of the measure elsewliere in the present session. The lionourable gentleman from Pictou (Han. Mr. Tanner) said that consistency and perseverance
lead to success. Well1, I challenge the consistency of some gentlemen who leave the
poker table to rush down and vote against a
measure of thîs kind. To show my own
consisten-cy amd earnestness, 1 amn willing to
meet all opponents of the Bill half way, and
if they can convince me that it is possible
to abolish the practice of garnbling& I too
will vote against the second re-ading. 1 think
it is not consistent to oppose a measure of
thîs kind strenuously and close our eyes to
the existence of charîty bazaars, wbeels of
fortune, games of chanceHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Pari mutuels.
Hon. Mr. LAC A$SE: -pari mutuels, and all
the rest of these things. Stop aIl gambling,
ail games of chance, and I will vote agsinst
this 'Bill. My main reason for suppor.ting this
proposed legislation is that it wou'ld divert to
our own sweepstakes a lot of money whieli is
being spent, to-day on other objecte, no more
wortliy, and aleo that many thousands of
dollars now being sent from Canada to purchaise gamibling tickets in f oreign lande would
be kept within our own country.
SI agree witli my lionourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), wlio said
that the Bill would be better if it were
dSrafted to include within its objectives the
support of educational institutions.

It was truly said by the honourable gentlemen from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) and
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) that this
measure dors net seek the enactment of any
new legislation so much as the acknowledgment of provincial rights. The adoption of it
would simply confer upon the provinces the
right to do as they please in the matter of
sweepstakes.
I am supporting the Bil. net only that I
may be consistent, but because I want to force
the issue, and also because I am desirous of
Lelping in my humble way the hoSpitals which
are in need of funds. I am well aware of
the existence of certain municipal problems
that were referred to by the right honourable
gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.

patients are sent to hospitals nowadays when
they could be taken care of at home, but on
the other hand it is possible that collective
treat ment can be given at a ower cost per
patient. For one thing, no private practitioner,
however much goodwill he may have, can
continue to treat people indefinitely for
nothing; but persons who have virtually no
means can be treated free by hospital staffs,
while others, who are able to pay, but may
presently be short of money, can be given
credit extending over a long period of months,
if necessary.
One honourable member said he considered
that gambling or the purchase of a lottery
ticket was not a sin, but something more or
less immoral. I should like to know the difference. It was also contended that if a lottery
were established in one province it would
mean that before long we should have nine,
because all the provinces would find it necessary to follow the example. Well, one way
of solving that problem would be te reduce
the number of provinces to three or four.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: With all due respect
te the views expressed by my honourable
friends who oppose the measure, I intend to
vote for it.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this Bill has been before us
three times since I entered the Senate. Formerly I did net take occasion to comment upon
it, but was satisficd merely to vote in the
negative. The same course would have been
followed by me at this time but for the introduction of certain comments by the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Muddock), to which I think some reference should
be made lest they go out to the public as

pcrlhaps representative of the feelings of all
honourable members. I do not know what
those comments Lad to do with the natter at
issue.

In fact, I can see no relationship at all.

They were observations on a report, appearing
in the morning press, of evidence given yesterday before a committee of the other Chamber,
and they reflected upon the fairness, and perhaps even upon the business ethics, of certain
institutions in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will my right
honourable friend let me make that point
clear, if Le did not understand me? Wlat
I meant was this, that in my judgment the
attitude of the distinguished gentlemen who
want to unload upon other people their
obligations to help sustain hospitals. is
the very same as the attitude of thirtyeight employers in the city of Toronto whio,
we were told by the morning press, were
paying such small wages that the municipality had to give additional money as
relief to numbers of those wage-earners who
are heads of families.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
able to see that the fart of small wages
being paid in factories, if such is the case,
is an argument in favour of this Bill or
against it, and I understood that the debate
lad to do solely with arguments on one side
or the other. I do net know anything of
the great majority of the companies referred
te in this evidence-or perhaps, to be more
in order, I should say who were referred to
in the morning press-but I think it is
most unfair that evidence which was submi.tted, andi as te which there has yet been
no opportunity for explanation or contradiction, should b heralded as indicative of bad
habits, unethical practices, and unfair dealings
on the part of reputable companies towards
their employees. These companies have as
yet had no opportunity to make themselves
heard, and onsequently we Lave to admit
that at the present time we are not in
possession of the facts. It may be that what
has been said cannot be contradicted; or
explained, but until opportunity is given for
contradiction or explanation we are not
justified in saying tha.t we know the truth.
I have information in respect of one case
which seems to me not only to throw a
different light upon evidence given yesterday, but to reflect very seriously upon
the responsibility of the man who gave it.
Consequently I feel rather strongly thait we
are adopting a very unfair and unjust
practice in assuming an ex parte statement
by one individual to be the whole facts.

FEBRUARY 28, 1934
Wthile I arn on my feet I arn going ta
try ta put into a few words-alIthough I fear
my thoughts are not weil-orderd-the
reasans whioh have persua-ded me in other
years and persuade me stili ta oppose -this
measure. They will fot, differ in any essential frarn those advan-ced this afterno-on by
the right honourable senatar fromn Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Grahamn). I arn not one
of those who, believe tJhat the habit of
ga.mbling, even if it is carried 'tou exceas, is
one of the most demoraiizing things in lufe,
but I 'think that it is flot a -habit ta be
encouraged by statute; and it seems ta me
bliat a very serious responsibility is 'taken by
a legisiature whioh puts its imprimatur upon
any practice, unlýess it is of the opinion that
the practice is a good one or that a restrieoted
sanction ai it would be more effeýctive than
total prohibition in restraint af indulgence.
If I feit that absolute gambiing, such as the
purchase of sweepstake tickets, ought. ta ha
encouragad and was flot at ail against the
interest, af the State, ïthen it, would appear
ta be my first duty ta remave that practioe
from 'the category ai crime in which it is
placed by our Criminal Code.
Somne honourable gentlemen say, "We
b3elieve in provincial rights, and we shauld
let the provinces decide whethar these things
are wrong or flot." Th-e Dominion bas sale
.iurisdiction in the reaimi of crimainal law, and
the Parliament of Canada is utte-rly incampatent to devolve upon any province authority to en'act criminal legisl'atian. We have
taken the ground that the purchasa af sweepstake tickets, being undaubtedly a formn ai
gamnbling, is samething which shauld bie denominated criminal and dealt with under aur
federal jurisdictian. Persanaliy 1 agree with
that view.
If we arc af the opinion of those wha feel
that the purchase of sweepstake tickets is not
samething ta ba denominated a crime, 1 submit we aught at once ta repe'al that section
ai aur Code. But so long as 'we have that,
provision in the Code, let us nat say that
while the Parliament af Canada considars
the practice, a crime, we are wîlling that the
provinces shall 'cansider it ojLherwise if they
sa desire. For us ta take, such a position
would ha not only quite out ai harmony
with the spirit of aour Constitution,, but pratty
close ta being whoiiy absurd. For instance,
having pasad criminal legislation that anyone guilty ai thef t shail go ta jail, we do flot
than providîe bhat if the theit is committed
by any province it shahl fot be regarded as a
crime at ail, becau-se provincial rights arein
volved and we must aliaw the province ta
say whether or not it wants ta ste-aI. Again,

provinces, as provinces, frrom the operatixn

explain what in his opinion is the difference,
between the proposai contained in this Bill

but tihe Pariiament ai Canada legalized this
iormn ai bctting, subject ta certain restrictions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. I have
no hope that meraly by deieating this measure
we shald bring total consistency inta the
statutes ai Canada. But there is this diffaTrnce
in regard ta inconsistency ta which the
honourable mamber refers. A limitation is
made by one authority in favour ai a certain
practice. That is ta say, we contend that wa
have authority, and we set about restraîning
the practice. We say, if this betting is conductad at ail it musnt ha by pari mutuel. But
we do not authorize the provinces ta commit
what we have dafined as a crime.
Ban. Mr. BARNARD: I hope my right
honourable friand wîli aliow me ta cite anather
example-the prohibition ai iiquor during the
War. It was a casa ai provincial local option.
Right Hon. M'r. MEIGREN: Na.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Balora wa had total

our jurisdiction in relation ta trade and commerce we ýdid enact by the so-ealied Doharty

iawiui by the province ta which it want. That
is wholiy different fromn passing a criminal law
ana day and next day saying ta the province
it may violate that iaw if it s0 desiras.
I came now ta a question which realIy
appertains ta the marits ai the law as it is,
aven if this Bill dace flot pass. I do xûot, think
that gambiing in sweepstakes or in any other
way is a practica ta ha encouraged hy lagislatures as samething warth while, and
aspecially ta be encouraged if the heneficiaries
are notable and deserving institutions. 1 do
not like saying in one breath, "This thing is
wrong and ha who does it gaes behind the

lotteries?

What about church

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have already
said that I never expect our statutes can be
made wholly consistent merely by the defeat
of this measure. I do not think there is any
sense whatever in exempting church lotteries
from the general prohibition of gambling.
I know there is gambling in everything. The
honoumble senator behind me said that gambling is in human nature and we shall never
get away from it. I bel-ieve that is true. I
do not believe ithere is any phase of life where
the element of chance or fortune does not
intervene. The success of one man as against
the failure of another is of.ten due in considerable measure to the hand of chance. In
greater or less degree that element is always
present. It is present in our everyday affairs
-in the purchase of an animai, in the purchase of a picture, certainly in the purchase
of a security. We never can eliminate that
element. It is part of the whole game of
living. In the stock market-and there must
adways be a market in order that business
may be carried on-no man can say that he
knows, as against the possibility of intervention of all sorts of contingencies, what is
going to take place. Therefore it is essential
that certain chances be taken, and tbey always
must be taken by enterprising persans, if the
world is to progress as it bas 'done all through
the centuries. But this is not to say that
gambling, for the sake of gambling, is something that the law itself must encourage. Nor
does it say that a man opposed to such encouragement is necessarily guilty of terrible
inconsistency if he puts up a quarter on a
poker game. When playing a game of
poker for this small stake he thinks he
is doing nobody else any harm and he is not
breaking the law. But he may well say, "As a
legislator I am not going to take the responsibility of helping to pass a statute to legalize
a practice whieh I do not think it is generally
desired should be encouraged."

But the
Right Hýon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
gambling element is pretty well eliminated

can, but because we cannot do so entirely it
surely does not follow that we must make
gambling lawful and encourage our young

men to believe that it is just as fine a way of
making a living as any other. I agree wholly
with the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). Surely we
should not put on the Statute Book an invitation to young men to seek to make a iliving
and to evade their honest debts to society, or
to charitable institutions, by the practice of
gambling. I should not like to have to defend
such a stand, either in my own home or anywhere else, before my fellows. That is why
I dhall vote against the Bill.
So far as I am concerned personally, nothing more nced be said. We never can get
the world perfect. Some argue that the sale
of liquor should be entirely prohibited. They
say that because liquor is net good for society
we ought to make its manufacture and sale
a crime and ban it wholly. Assuming their
premises to be sound, it does net follow that
their rem*edy is feasible. If the traffic cannot
as a matter of practical executive authority
be banned, it may be better to seek to control it within certain limits. Our purpose is
net to encourage, but rather te restrain the
traffic, and we find in practice that we eau
restrain it better by laws of control than by
attempting total prohibition. I must say that
in the last few years there has been ample
justification for this view in the experience
both of Canada and of the country to the
south.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What about the
marriage at Cana, where the Lord changed

water into wine?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was net
present on that occasion. The reasoning by
which ive support liquor contrel, namely, that
thereby we reduce a practice which we wish
to discourage better than we could reduce it
by attempted total prohibition, cannot possibly
apply in support of this measure. We do not
here pretend te say, "People are going to
gamble anyway; therefore turn gambling into
certain channels and control it within those
channels." This Bill does net seek to do that.
It does not seek to shut the door half way.
It simply opens the door on certain terms.
It says to the people of Canada, "If you wish
the proceeds of gambling to go to this or that
hospital we do net object, but we do object
if you get the benefit yourselves." For these
reasons I intend again to vote against the
measure.

subsidy did 6he receive in lieu of public lands?
2. How often has that subsidy been increased
since then?
3. What was the date and the ausount of eneli

was granterl from January 1, 1882, by Act 45
Victoria, Ciapter 5, as indemnity for want of
Public Lands, and was increased Vo $100,000
frorn July 1, 1885, by Act 48 Victoria, Ciapter

Under tie provisions of the Manitoba
Boundaries Extension Act of 1912, this grant
was increased to $562,50 in lieu of public lands
as frorn July 1, 190W, subject ta certain deductions on account of the retransfer of swamp
lands and by reason of an allotmnent of land as
an endowmient to the University of Manitoba.
(Yearly deductions from 1908 Vo 1929-30 for
swamp lands $138,492.82; yearly deductions
from 1908 Vo 1929-30 for unîversity lands $15,000,00.)
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Was noV another increase made later in the final settlement with
the province?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Tiere was no
increase in the subsidy. There was some reference to a Commission ta ascertain what compensation should lie made i order that in
relation ta lier public lands Manitoba might
take ber place on an equality witi the otier
provinces. In its report tie Commiion recommended compensation ta the extent of $5,000,000. This was duly paid, and duly spent.

belief that
The people of Canada have but a very vague
and quite erroneous impression as to the
responsibility of this honourýable House with
respect to government.
He then added:
I make bold to suggest that some honourable
member, with long experience both in this and
in the other House, as weIl es in the Government, should make a very olear statement on
the responsibility of the Senate and the scope
of its authority. In this way, I arn sure, wve
should hear much less criticismi of this honourable body by reason of the long adjournmente
which are necessaxry fromn time to time for lack
of business.
As the author of the suggestion, the honourable gentleman would have been regarded by
bis fellow members as the proper person to
place the Senate in its proper liglit before
Parliament and the country, but 'le prefers to
subordinate bis own fitness for the task and
allow a memiber of longer parliamentary experience Vo undertake it. Hie bas paid me

to join me on a short excursion into parliamentary history, so that they may note certain

SENATE

go back to pre-Confederation days and ascertain the intentions of the framers of our Constitution. During the Confederation Debates
of 1865 Sir John Macdonald outlined what he
and his associates had in view with regard
to Parliament in these words:
The legislature of British North America
vill be conposed of King, Lords and Commons.
The Legislative Council vill stand in the same
relation to the Loweer Hoiuse, as the House of
Lords to the louse of Commons in England,
having the saine porer of initiating all matters
of legislation, except the granting off money.
On the same occasion Sir John proceeded
to amplify the remarks that I bave just
quoted, as follows:
In order to protect local interests. and to
prevent sectional jealousies, it wa;s found
requisite that the three great divisions into
which British North America is separated
should be represented in the Upper Humise on

the principle of equality. . . . Accordingly, in
the U7pper House . . . which has the sober
second-thought in legislation, it is provided that
eaei of those groat sections shall bo represented equally by tw enty-four members.
There would be no use of an Upper House
if it did net exercise, when it thought proper,
the right of opposing, or amending, or postponing, the legislation of the Lower House. It
would be of no value whatever were it a mere
Chamber for registering the decrees of the
Lower Ieuse.
It must be an independent
House, having a free action of its own, for it
is only valuable as being a regulating body,
calimly considering the legislation initiated by
the popular branch, and preventing any hasty
or ilI-considered legislation which may come
from that body.
The three great divisions of the country
to which Sir John Macdonald referred were
Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces.
Each of these being represented by 24 members made the initial membership of the Senate
72. This number was later increased to 96
by the representation given to new provinces.
Now let us begin our journey through the
records of Parliament with the year 1868.
Few subjects have been more frequently diseuîssed in this Chamber than that of securing
for it a greater volume of legislative business.
Scarcely had the first Parliament after Confederation got into working order when it was
felt that, under the then existing parliamentary procedure, something should be done
to originate more bills in the Senate. Accordingly, in 1868, a select committee was
appointed to "consider and report whether by
any alterations in the forms and proceedings
of this House the despatch of public business
can be more effectively performed," and that
committee, through its Chairman, Sir Alexander Campbell, presented its report on May
7, 1868.
The situation which confronted that select
committee and its report bear such close

MURPHY.

relation to what we are confronted with today that, with the permission of the House,
I will read the whole report:
The Committee are of opinion that the forms
and practices of the Senate are well calculated
to prevent delay in the passing of bills, or in
the transaction of other business; but bills will,
according to the present practice, be sent up by
the other Bouse of Parliament at so late a
period of the session as to render it impossible
to give thei that full consideration which the
public interests require. This comuplaint has
been constantly made in the liouse of Lords,
and in the upper branches of the several
colonial legislatures, and has foried the subject
of repeated discussions, but no sufficient remnedy
lias been suggested.
The Committee have under their notice, the
modes of remedying the evil in question suggested by the committee of the House of Lords
in a report of the 7th of May, 1851. These
modes were either that some portion of the
legislation which originated

in the House

of

Commons should commence in the louse of
Lords, or that some alteration should be made
in the forms and proceedings of the Commons
which would enable it to devote more tiie
and attention to legislative measures during
the early part of the session.
The Committee would observe that independently of financial mneasures wrhich begin as of
course in the House of Commons, the representative character of that House, and the
system of responsible government, render it
expedient that some other classes of important
hills should be first discussed there; the Comnittee are, nevertheless, of opinion that it
would be quite possible to originate a much
larger number of bills in the Senate than has
hitherto been the practice in the Legislative
Councils of any of the provinces of the
Dominion. Lt appears to the Committee that
it imust rest chiefly with the Government of
the day to accomplish this; the business of
Parliament wrill hereafter, the Committee believe, be principally in connection with publie
measures, and in the hands of the Governent,
and it
ill depend upon Ministers themselves
in which House of Parliament many of these
aseasures shall originate. The Comimittee think
that the public interest in the more thorough
consideration of legislative measures, as well as
in the dispatch of business, would be much
better served by a persistent effort on the part
of the Government of the day to originate in
the Sonate as many of their measures as the
law and usage of Parliament will permit.
The Comimittee vould further remark that
the Constitution, in establishing an Upper
louse of Parliament composed of life members,
contemrplates on the part of that branch a
supervision, undisturbed by temporary political
cuirrents and partisan warfare, of the legislation of the day. Lt is impossible, the Committee believe, that the Senate shall adequately
fill its place in the Constitution and discharge
those functions upon which its usefulness to
the country so much depends, unless ample
opportunity is given for the discussion in that
House of all measures submitted for its consideration. In the absence of any other remedy,
it mnight become necessary to secure this, even
by the extreme measure of declining to consider
bills, with certain exceptions, brought up from
the Commons within a fixed period of the end
of a session-

MARCH 1, 1934
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
-but the Committee trust that other remedies
may be found. The forms and proceedings of
the Senate, the Committee think, are well
adapted for the dispateh of public business;
whether any change could advantageously be
made in this connection in those of the House
of Commons must be left te the wisdom of that
House to decide.
This report was unanimously adopted by the
Senate on May 12, 1868. If any further action
was taken, it is not disclosed in the records.
Now let us come to 1874. Another phase of
the same subject came up for discussion in
1874 when a special committee was appointed
by the House of Commons to consider whether
"any facilities can be given for the despatch
of business in Parliament, especially in regard
to the relationship of the two flouses," and
requesting that the Senate "appoint an equal
number of members to unite with the members of the House of Commons in the formation of a joint committee of both Houses on
the said subject."
The Senate duly appointed a committee of
its members to act with the committee of
the other House, but, as bas often happened
with joint committees, nothing practical was
done.
From 1874 to 1879 the records are silent on
the subject, but in 1879 the Hon. Mr. Miller,
speaking in the Senate, voiced a protest
against the manner in which legislation had
come up from the other branch of Parliament
at the close of the session. Evidently there
was a change for the better, because in the
session of 1880-81 Senator Miller again referred
to the matter and said:
I think it is only fair, under the altered
circumstances this year, to compliment the
Govermnient on the decided improvement which
has taken place in that respect during the
present session of Parliament. We have had
very important measures initiated here, and
had full time to diseuse them. We have not,
on any one single day up to the close of the
session, been behind with our work. . . .

We

have been able to keep up with it, and give
it al the time that we thought it deserved. . . .
I only hope the good departure the Government
have made this year will be followed up in
subsequent sessions.
. Apparently the improvement that Senator
Miller noted in the method of sending up
business from the Lower House was not of
long duration, because in the Senate Debates
for the session of 1882 there is to be found a
vigorous protest by the Hon. Mr. Alexander,
who did not mince hie words, as the following
extract will show:

107

It is time that we spoke freely on this subjeet, because the people could not elect a body
such as the members of this House are, for
intelligence and experience, and we ought to
desire to raise the Senate in the public estimation, so that they will love and honour this
body. I think the Senate must display greater
activity, it muet not permit any Government,
I do not care what Government it may be,
to treat us as we have been treated. It is
simply discreditable that we should remain
without any bills 'before us until 36 hours
previous te the end of the session. What an
insult to the House that measures ehould be
brought te us within 48 hours of the end of
the session! It is treating us with contempt
and showing that they do not care what becomes
of the Senate--it is showing that they do not
care what use is made of this body, and that
they do not care if the Senate gets into bad
repute with the country.
Had Hon. Mr. Alexander been a member
of the House of Commons in Sir John Macdonald's time, it is not likely that he would
have been turned aside as easily as were some
members of that Chamber who once voiced
a protest similar to his, whereupon Sir John
is reported to have told this story:
A man guilty of forgery, was arrested for
the crime, immediately put into the dock, tried
and convieted. When the prisoner was asked
if he had anything te say, he rejoined:
"Nothing, further than I think this is a smart
place for doing business."
Needless to say, the incipient mutiny was
quelled there and then.
In the year 1908 Hon. Mr. McMullen introduced a motion in the Senate with reference
'to the agitation regarding the services rendered by the Senate as a part of our legielative
system." By way of amendment Hon. Mr.
David moved:
That it is desirable, in order to increase the
efficiency of the Senate, that more legislation
be initiated in the House, that more ministers
of the Crown have seats therein, and that any
minieter personally m*ay introduce and defend
Government measures in both Houses.
Then, in amendment to the amendment,
Hon. Mr. Béique presented a motion declaring:
That the present constitution of the Senate
seems to be on the whole the best which can be
d'evised for this country; that, moreover, in
order that this honourable House may give the
full measure of its usefulness, it is greatly
desirable that means be adopted to keep it
more constantly occupied, thereby relieving the
House of Commons of part of its work and
shortening the sessions of parliament.
After a lengthy and illuminating discussion,
the main motion, the amendment and the
amendment to the amendment were withdrawn.

108

SENATE

On September 12, 1917, the Senate adopted
a resolution for the appointment of a special
committee:
To consider the question of determining what
are the rights of the Senate ini matters of
financial legislation, and whether under the
provisions of the British North Anerica Act,
1867, it is permissible-and to what extentor forbidden. for the Senate to amend a Bill
enbodying financial clauses (money bill), the
Senate comniittee to report to the Senate as
soon as possible.
The committee that was appointed to give
effect to the terms of 'this motion reported to
the Senate in May, 1918, and its report was
printed in a special pamphlet. Its principal
conclusions were as follows:
1. That the Senate of Canada has, and always
had since it was created, the power to amend
bills originating in the Commons appropriating
any part of the revenue or imposing a tax, by
reducing the amounts therein, but has not the
right to increase the saine without the consent
of the Crown.
2. That this power was given as an essential
part of the Confederation contract.
The report also contains the written
opinions of three eminent members of the
legal profession in Quebec and Ontario, the
gist of which may be found in this sentence:
Under the circumstances, we are of the
opinion that the Senate of Canada may amend
a money bill originating in the flouse of
Commons as fully as the louse of Commons can
do. Of course the powers of the Senate are
limited to the same extent as those of the
House of Commons by the fact that money bills
must be recommended by a message of the
Governor General.
The report of the committee was debated
at length during the session of 1918, and the
speeches then Idelivered form a comprehensive review of the powers and privileges of
the Senate.
By adopting the report the
Senate expressed its approval of the committee's findings.
In the session of 1919 Senator Nicholls
noved:
Tihat a Standing Committee on Finance be
appointed, and that Ruile 78 of the Rules of
the Senate be amended accordingly, and that
the senators in attendance on the session be
surnmoned to consider this motion.
In explanation of his motion Senator
Nicholls said:
My proposal is that all money bills may be
referred to this committee.
It has been
charged against this House in the past that
it does not do its full d'uty. It may be true
that the reports of a Finance Committee can
be only advisory or suggestive, and that we
bave not the power legally to carry into effect
any reconmmendation we may advance. But, at
all events, when money bills corne before this
House, we shall have had a report from this
Finance Committee enabling us to know what
Hon.

Mr. MURPHY.

those bills are going to cost us, vhat will be
the cost of the services which the bills are to
provide, and, furthermore, we shall feel that we
have doue our duty to ourselves and the
country.
The committee was appointcd and became
what is known as the standing Committtee on
Finance. Shortly after the appointment of
the committee, the Public Accounts and the
Auditor General's Report were referred to it.
Later on, the Auditor General was suimoned before the committee and furnished
information as to the operation of his office,
and as to the payments made te the Imperial
Governiment during the War. If the work of
this conmittee were oarried on as Senator
Nicholls proposed, and extended as circumstances might warrant, it should be of great
assistance to this Chamber in directing and
crystallizing its scrutiny of publie expenditure.
During the session of 1923, on motion of
the honourable member from De Lorimier
(Hon. M-r. Dandurand), who displays his exceptional parlialmentary knowledge and skill
in his leadership of this side of the House,
it was ordered:
That a message be sent to the House of
Comnions requesting that House to unite in the
appointment of a joint conmmittee to be composed of an equal number of members. not
exceeding five, of each House, to consider the
following inatters:
1. The forms of bills and the best nmcans of
affording the information and assistance in the
consid'eration thereof at all stages of legislation
in both Houses of Parliament.
2. The better distribution of the work of
legislation between the two Houses.
There is another paragraph in the motion so
adopted, but as it does not relate to the
subject-matter under discussion, I have net
quoted it.
The joint committee was appointed, held
meetings, and made its report. That report
was presented in the Senate and adopted on
the 14th of June, 1923. It is printed in full
in the Senate Journals for that date. Clause
2 of the report reads as follows:
Your Comnittee furtber recominend' that the
distribution of all private bills, exclusive of
divorce bills, be regulated by the Speakers of
both Houses jointly, with the understanding
that they will see as far as practicable that
private bills, exclusive of divorce bills, be introduced one-half in each House.
A further search of the records did not reveal
what, if anything, had been done to give
effect to this recommendation.
Now let me direct attention to some further proposed xemedies. Among those most
frequently suggested for increasing the business of the Senate was that of allowing
Cabinet Ministers to introduce and explain

MARCH 1, 1934

109

their bis in this honourable House. That
proposai was made as f ar back as 1874, when
Hon. Mr. Reed moved that "in the opinion
of this House a fair proportion of Ministers
have flot seats in this Chaier." He was
snrry that "it was neot the intention of the
Government, to have an additional number of
Ministers in this House next Session." He
considered that "it was flot fair that aâ the
Cabinet Ministers but two shouki be in the
other House," and thouglit " that the example
of the House of Lords might be followed,
where one-third of the Cabinet Ministers
had seats." At the time in question , that
is, in 1874, the records of the House were
meagre and incomplete, and they do not
afford any further information about the Hon.
Mr. Reed's -motion.
A fairly diligent search seeme to establish
that -the next, retorded, reference to Cabinet
Ministers appearing in this House in support
of their legisilation is contained in the Debates
and Journalq of the Blouse of ConTrnns for
1921. On March 21 of that year Hon.
Rodolphe Lemieux moved:
'Uhat, in the opinion of this House, it is in
the interest of good government that Ministers
of the Crown should be permitted to sit in
and
measures
whenever
either Chamber,
policies are introduced affecting their respective
departments.
The mover of that motion, who is now -the
honourabie member from. Rougemont in this
Chamiber, and sits to my ieft, supported the
motion in a convincing speech, during which
lie said:
1 do flot see why a Minister of the Crown
sitting, for instance, in the Upper Chamber,
should net have a righ't te appear before the
Ho~use of Commons te explain the policies of
bis department and to answer questions when
the estimates of bis department are scrutinized
in the Honse. Nor do I se why the gentlemen
who occupy the Government benches in this
flouse shouid not be aliowed to appear in the
llpper Chamber to give there such explanation
as may be required of them. There is nothing
new under the sun. This system whieh I arn
now propounding is thec system foliowed in
France.

Among those who took part in the Cernmons debate of May, 1921, was the then
Prime Minister of Canada (Riglit Hon.
Mr. .Meighen), who now rejpresents the Government in this Chamber with the same conepicuous abhty that niarked his disdlarge of
a like function in the ýother Cheimber. The
speech of the riglit honourabie gentleman on
the occasion referred to contained the f oilowing important expression of lis views:
I d-, net know that there would be very
mudli te be feared if a Minister were permitted
to cerne into this flouse from the Senate and
discuss any topic that is before us; or, vice
versa, that a Minister miglit go f rom this flouse
to the Senate and discuss any topic that is
under discussion there. In practice it would be
availed of only in such cases as seemed te cal
for the attention of the Minister in question in
the (>thé flouse. Very likely it would work
out in that way and there would be very littie
abuse o>fthe prîvilege.

And lie inight have added that the same
practice prevailed in the parlisanents of othes,
European countries as well.
aleo took
The honourabie
gentleman
occasion to point out that at the time he
was speaking "three 'Ministers of the Crown
have seats in the Upper Cham-ber, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Labour
and the Postmaster 'General." For the information of our new members, 1 miiglit
expilain that the then Postmaster General
ie now the honourable and respected Speaker
of the Senate.

Again, the honourable member made a
comprehensive speech, and a number of other
honourable gentlemen took part in the discussion. Among them was the honourable
gentleman who leads this side of the House.
Hie made this important declaration:
Various kinds of reform in our niethods of
dealing with legisiation have been suggested in
the so>mewhat lengtby period that I have been
a member of the Sonate, and I have corne to
the conclusion that the only cure for the

And lie continued:
I muet say that much for which the honourable gentleman contends appeals to me, and I
can see a very great deal of advantage indeed
in suci 'a system, as he urges.
The niglit honourable gentleman also contrihbuted this furthee piece *of information:
It was suggested in the debate in 1908, 1
think by the Speaker of the Senate at that
time, that there was power in either assembly
by resolution te give this right te Ministers
sitting in the other flouse.
After a very full debate in which other
favourable opinions were elîcited, the motion
was witédrawn.
Shaotly after bis translation from the flouse
of Commons to the Sonate, the honourable
member from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux)
revived the subI ect in this Chamber, on May
26, 1931, when lie moved the following reolution:
Resolved, that in order te expedite the business of Parliament, Ministers of the Crewn
should be permitted to appear froma time te
time before this flouse for the purpose of
explaning and giving information with respect
te Government legislation.

present unihalaned state of afi'airs hptween the

two flouses is to, ho found in a change of
procedure which would permit Cabinet Min-

110

SENATE

isters who have seats in the other House to
appear here to explain their legislation, but, of
course, not to vote.
The bonourable gentleman went on to express the following opinion:
In my opinion the wxhole question involves
simply a matter of procedure with us. We
need only to amend our Rules in order to have
the Ministers appear here, if they are willing
to cone. They (o attend now before our
comiinttees.
A further contribution to the same debate
was made by the right honourable member
[rom Eganville, who sits at my riglt (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham). Bis conclusion was:
J do think that some way might be found to
lessen the difficulties that exist in the transaction of business between the two Chambers.
If any government docs not wish to have Ministers with portfolios in the Senate, I think it
might be represented here by at least three or
four Ministers without portfolio, to whom it
could confide its business.
So much for the efforts and suggestions
made to obtain a larger share of legislation
for this Chamber. The evidence that I have
thus far adduced makes it plain, I submit,
that the Senate bas never evaded its responsibilities or shirked its work.
Now, let me turn to another chapter of the
Senate's record. Speaking in this House in
1906, Sir Richard Cartwright said:
It is not by any manner of means a trifling
thing when J say that the value of a Senate is
not only in wshat the Senate does, but in what
the Senate prevents other people fron doing.
Critics who make merry over what the
Sonate has cost the country always take care
not te mention what the Senate has saved
the country. A few minutes may be profitably devoted to a consideration of the services rendered by the Senate in this latter
regard.
As early as 1875 the Senate displayed its
concern for saving public funds by rejecting
a Bill for the construction of the Esquimault
and Nanaimo Railway. That Bill proposed
an expenditure of $650,000, and a land grant
of 1,300,000 acres, both of which were saved
for the country by the action of the Senate.
Even if the land were not worth more than $1
per acre, that would represent another saving
of $1,300,000.
The same regard for safeguarding public
funds was exhibited by the Senate in 1897. In
that year the House of Commons passed a
Bill for the purchase of the Drummond County
Railway and to provide for the extension of
the Intercolonial Railway to Montreal. The
Senate rejected the Bill. In 1898 the House
of Commons passed a new Bill with respect
Hon. Mr. MURPHY.

to the same project, which was approved by
the Senate, and according to the figures then
submitted there was a saving of over $700,000,
as compared with the 1897 proposai.
In 1898 the Senate rejected a Bill for the
construction of a railway from Atlin to
Dawson City. That Bill involved, by way of
subsidy, a gift of 25,000 acres of mineral lands
for eaci mile of railway, and as it was proposed to construct a road about 150 miles in
length, that would mean a total gift of 3,750,000 acres of mineral lands to the promoters. During the debate it was alleged,
and not successfully disputed, that these
minerai lands were worth at that time $10 an
acre. At that figure the saving was $37,500,000.
In the sessions of 1911 and 1912 the Senate
opposed a Bill that was first introduced in the
other House in 1911, and again in 1912, to aid
highway construction; and the same Bill being
introduced in the same House in the session
of 1912-13, the Senate again opposed and
amended it. After its amendments had been
s nt back to the Commons, no further message was received from the Commons, and the
Bill died with prorogation.
The bills in question did not mention the
amount to be expended by the Dominion, but
provided "for a subsidy to be paid to any
province for the construction of any highways,
not exceeding such a sum as might in any
year be voted by Parliament for that purpose."
Therefore, if the Bill had become law, there
would have been an enormous drain upon the
Dominion treasury, because, as we know from
the experiences of recent years, each province
would have embarked on an expensive plan of
My recollection is
highway construction.
that it was stated that $25,000,000 would be
the amount of the first grant from this Parliament, but I have been unable to verify this in
the records, although I remember distinctly
that it was stated in the press, if not in Parliament, that such would be the initial outlay.
In 1913 the Senate opposed the Naval Aid
Bill, involving an expenditure of $35,000,000,
until the verdict of the electors coulid be
obtained on the dissolution of Parliament.
The Bilil with the Senate amendment was net
proceeded with.
In 1924 twenty-six Bills, known as the
Canadian National Branch Lines Bills, providing for an expenditure of $28,311,300, were
introduced in the Commons. The Senate
rejected seven of these bills, and the saving
thus effected amounted to $12,249,000.

MMRCH 1, 1934
In the session of 1925 further Canadian
National Branch Lines Bis were introduced,
providing for the construction of two of the
lines rejected in 1924. In the case of one of
these lines the mi-leage was reduced from 115
to 27, with, of course, a proportionate reduction in the cost; and li the case of the
second uine there was a reduction in the
mileage from 102 miles proposed in the 1924
Bill to 67 miles in the 1925 Bull, and, again,
with a proportionate reduction in cost.
According to the -records of the Senate, the
action of this Huse with respect to those
branch lines resulted in a total saving of
$10,634,000.
In 1925, the Senate opposed a measure passed
by the bouse of Commons to recoup those
who had iost money in the Home Bank failure
to the extent of $5,450,000. In the Senate
this amount was reduced to $3,000,000, and
thus a saving of $2,450,000 was effected.
Without adding other exampies, it may
safely ha said that on the basîs of figures
de-finitely ascertainable, and of conservative
estimates where actuni figures were not available, the Senate bas saved the country by its
action in amending or rejecting bis a total of
at least $103,650,000. And even that total does
not tell the whoie story. But it ought to be
sufficient to give pause to those who at times
assume the role of authorities on the funetioning of Parliament, and who, when they
corne to deal with the Senate, display their
fitness and impartiality by looking at oniy one
aide of the iedger-and that the debit side.
And, now, a final word as to our predecessors
in this Chamber-the men who strove, as the
records show, to preserve the character with
which the Senate was invested by the Fathers
of Confederation, and at the same time
strove also to increase its usefuiness. No
longer do they dwell amongst us. They have
gone to that "undiscovered country, from
whose bourne no traveller returns." Among
them were types of the highest and hast in
Canadian citizanship. To recail but a few:
there were two Prime Ministars of Canada,
Hon. J. J. C. Abbott and Sir Mackenzie
Boweil; two former Provincial Premiers, Sir
Oliver Mowat and Sir George W. Ross;
Cabinet Ministers with portfolios and Cabinet
Ministers without portfolios; great mercbants
lika Sir George Drummond of Montreal, Hon.
John Mcflonald of Toronto, and his fellow
citizen, Sir Frank Smith-the mani who, whex.
aIl seemed lost li the darkast days of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway's comstruction, oaved
that exiterprise fTrm complete coliapse hy
securing for it the Goverument subsidy which

1

had plunged into the dapths of despair Sir
William Van borna, .Sir George Stephen and
ail the others who had tried to obtain it and
failcd. By his action in that instance Sir
Frank Smith saved flot only the Canadiçtn
Pacifie Railway, but the financial solvency of
the Dominion as weli. Also deserving of
grateful remembrance were distinguished members of the lagal and medical professions, and
of many other branches of our national life,
aIl of whomn made substantial contributions to
the country's material walfare. They did more.
They upheld the dignîty, the self-respect and
the indapendance of Parliament, thus creating
a tradition of sustained public service, the
study of which may often afford hoth relief
and inspiration, particularly in thesa iconoclastie days.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: bonourable
scnators, if no other honourable mambar
desires to-day to taka part ini the discussion
which undoubtedly wiil develop on this question, I would move adi ournment of the debat-a
until next Tuesday. My colleague who sits to
my right (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will then be
present to continue the discussion.
The motion was agreed to and the debate
was adjourned.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: Othier provinces may have taken part in the protest, but
they do flot appear an the record before me.
The purpose of the Biii is to permit the importation of liquor from onc province to another, prnvided that when the liquor reaches
the other province it goes either to the Liquor
Commission or to its licensees. ilonourabie
members will recali that the Doherty Act forbade the transport of liquor across the boundaries of a province unless it w-as destined ta
the Liquor Commission of the impor*ing province. In Quebec flot oniy is the Liquor Comnmission authorized to purchase, but it in turn
designates certain others, I think chiefly hotel
and restaurant keepers, to receive consignments. Tbe practice bas grown up of consigning liquor to sucb authorized persons instead
of to the Liquor Commission. Technicaily àt
is a violation of the Act, and therefore it is
desirabie tbat the Act be amended sa that
wbiat is a perfectiy correct practice sball not
be a violation of the Iaw. Two of the Western Provinces abject to the Bill on tbe graund
that it xviii leave tbem witbout the means of

The officiais of the Justice Department wbio

Hon. R. D. bORNER: banourahie muembers, I feel inciined ta thank the bonaurabie
senatar framn De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) for the elaquent manner in wbich hie
described ta the bouse last Tuesday how for
the past three hundred years ships bave sailed
into Hudson Bay. As I coma from Northern
Saskatchewan, tbe section of the Dominion
that expects ta receive the greateat benefit
froma the Hudson Day route, I amn somnewhat
aiarmed by bis description of the tidles in the
straits. It is said that time and tide wait for
fia man, but 1 fear they play tricks with same
men's imaginations. I 'have taiked with a
Government representative who spent many
years at Hudsan Bay, and, if I remember
correctly, hie taid me that the straits couid be
navigated during the entire year, and that the
oniy difficuity experienced was in the bay.
Now I may point ouit ta honourable senators the reason why we in Northexn Saskatchewan believe that we sha3l henefit by the
Hudson Day route. The country within five
hundred miles of Churchill is being opened Up,
and alfalfa and hay and other grains can be
grown there in almost any quanitities. But
grain grown. in Northern Saskatchewan bas ta
cross Manitoba in order ta get ta the head
of the lakes, und ta get ta Vancouver it bas

MARCH 1, 1934
to cross Alberta, and as the rate on that
grain is five cents higher than the rate even
from the southeastern portion of Saskatchewan, this adds to our difficulties in competing
with the other wheat-growing countries of the
world.
I have no doubt that the port of
Churchill wiil prove to be a great success.
We must not forget that time is an important
element in the development of any great
undertaking. Some honourable gentlemen will
remember that when the Canadian Pacific
Railway was first contemplated it was said
that it could never prosper-that it was to
run through a desert. Yet it was not very
long until a third transcontinental .railway was
built through that territory. Conditions
change as the country develops.
Here is what Sir Wilfrid Laurier had to say
in the House of Commons on April 3, 1906,
about the port of Churchill:
I hope that I shall live to see a city at the
terminus of a Hudson Bay railway at the
niouth of the Churchill river.
It is not enough for us to confine our views
to the Canada that is now settled; we must
look ahead; we must push northward as far as
colonization can go. I have great confidence
that before many years are passed we shall
see towns and villages on the shores of Hudson
Bay, as we see on the shores of Norway, where
people will be prosperously engaged in the
lumbering business, the pulp industry, the fishing industry, the mining industry, and others.
That is what I hope Canadians will sec ere
long.

at low water, and a further area of about
180 acres with depths varying from 18 to
30 feet at low water, beyond which there is a
vast area of lesser depth.
Owing to the configuration of the cliffs guarding the entrance the only gales which affect
the inside area are those from directions between north-north-east and east-north-east, and
because of the inclination of the inner area
to the southeast, the only part affected by such
gales is a short strip of shore on the west side
of the entrance, where two small bays are
clearly the beaches on which waves caused by
these gales spend themselves.
The distance from Saskatoon to Churchill is
847 miles, and from Churchill to Liverpool
2.967 miles-a total of 3,814 miles, or a saving
by the Hudson Bay route of 1,064 miles, with
57 miles less rail haul.
In view of what the honourable senator from
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mtr. Gillis) told you
about the shipment of cattle, you will realize
the importance of this.
The Hudson Bay Railway, with shorter routes
from the west and south in the future, should
revolutionize Canadian commerce. It will give
the west closer and more profitable connection
with overseas countries; it will open a new field
for settlement and unlock a northern empire
richly endowed with minerals, timber, waterpower and other resources. The trade of the
Dominion will no longer flow only east and
west; a new trade and travel highway will have
been provided. A circle with a radius of 1,600
miles from Churchill includes North Dakota,
South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, practically
all of Montana and a great part of Wyoming,
Nebraska and Iowa. Build a railway across
the northern part of the Prairie Provinces,
connecting Churchill directly with a port on
the Pacific coast, and the rich Peace River
country will be nearer to European markets
than Western Ontario is to-day.
I do not behieve that we shall entirely
abandon the use of Montreal and the St.
Lawrence route, but it is my conviction that
the port of Churchill wiJl be of great benefit
to Northern Saskatchewan.
To show you the enormous quantities of
grain that Saskatchewan is capable of producmg, I may say that during the time of the
Wheat Boar4, in 1919 or 1920, Saskatchewan
exported more wheat than all the other provinces of the Dominion combined. While it
is true that we experienced difficulty in some
parte of the province-end the people of the
East have been very good in aiding us therenevertheless, the people of the northern part
of the province were able to donate cars of
feed and potatoes and that sort of thing, to
assist those in other parts of the province who
were less fortunate than themselves.
I think, in view of what I have pointed out
to you, honourable gentlemen, you will realize
the great importance of the Hudson Bay route
to the people of Northern Saskatchewan.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March
6, at 8 p.m.

Captain Bernier has every fai.th in the
Hudson Bay route, although he admits that
modern ships are necessary. If ships were
able to go into Churchill three hundred years
ago, there is no reason why the Hudson Bay
route should not be a wonderful success today in view of the advances that have been
made in the ship-building industry. Nowhere
else, I think, have we made greater advances
than in the matter of ship construction and
economy af operation.
Just here, in reply to the remarks of the
honourable senator from Le Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) as to the size of the harbour at
Fort Churchill and the difficulty of turning
a vessed, I should like to read an extract
from the Canadian Geographical Journal of
1931:
At Churchill, nature has provided magnificent
breakwaters consisting of rocky cliffs rising to
heights of from forty to seventy feet, enclosing
a harbour of six miles in length and from one
to two and a half miles in width at low water
and one and a half to four miles at high water.
The entrance ta the harbour consists of a
narrow gap between these headlands, with a
low-water width of 1,600 feet, 850 feet at
30 feet depth, and 750 feet at 60 feet or more.
Inside the entrance there exists to-day an area
of 140 acres with depth of 30 feet and over

Prayers and routine proceedings.
THE

LATE

SENATOR LAWRENCE
WILSON

TRIBUTE

A.

TO HIS MEMORY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, news of the death of Senator
Lawrence A. Wilson came with great surprise
and undoubtedly much sadness to us all.
Only a little more than three years ago did
he enter the Upper Chamber, after a very
industrious and useful sojourn in the Lower
House, extending over five years.
Senator Wilson had reached the age of
three score years and ten. ie had contributed
most of his service in this world in the way
of business activity, having been for forty
years a very prominent wine importer in the
Montreal district of the province of Quebec.
His assiduity, native shrewdness and intense
devotion to bis work resulted in success which
made him a man of means and enabled him
in the latter years of his life to enjoy the
wonderful exhilaration which comes from the
helping of others. I have no doubt at all
that those latter years were the happiest of
his life, and in them he did more than most
men have the good fortune te be able to do,
in distributing among his fellows out of bis
bounty and bringing joy into the hearts of
thousands. We all know of his interest in
agriculture, and particularly in charitable institutions. Suffice to say that at the end
he was honorary governor of no less than four
hospitals in this country. His benefactions to
education were equally lavish. His personality was one that is certainly net easily forgotten; indeed, it was one that we love to
remember, because of its singular charin. He
had urbanity, a gift of happy presence, and in
the circles in which he best was known he
was veritably loved.
I could scarcely do better in summing up
the splendid phases of his life than to quote
the following brief extract from an article in
a paper published near his home:
Few men indeed have touched the lives of
so many individuals in this community with
such a kindly grace as did the late Senator
Lawrence A. Wilson, and none kept alive so
many friendships or so constantly made new
ones.
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

Benevolence, finely executed, was the keynote
of Mr. Wilson's personality. Innumerable individuals had reason to thank him for kindnesses throughout the years; and institutions
innunierable also received his help. Neither
race nor creed made any difference to him.
Any institution connected with philanthropy
and the relief of suffering could count on him
as a friend. Hospitals in particular were the
object of his assistance, and educational institutions were enriched by his bounty.
To the people of bis native Coteau du Lac
be was a veritable father, and sadly will they
miss him.
Canada will lament, and deeply will his own
neighbourhood lament, the passing of a man
of his type and character. His colleagues in
this House, who had cultivated a real affection
for him, will all join with his friends in tendering sincerest sympathy to the members of his
family.
Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM:
Right
Honourable members, the relentless regularity
with which occasions of this kind have been
thrust upon us during the past months must
almost cause us to pause and wonder at the
peculiarities of life and the sureness of death.
As one writer has said:
Friend after friend departs.
Who has net lost a friend?
In the atmosphere of the Senate, unlike that
of any other organization of which I have ever
been a participating member, we feel, when
one of our fellow members bas passed, that
we have iost not merely an associate but a
personal friend. This is true even of those
who may not have come into contact to any
great extent with the member who has been
called away.
I think that we ought to stop to consider
for a moment whether we have any time at
our disposail to enter into the smaller bickerings of life, or whether we could not make
better use of our time in looking on the
brighter side of things, the better side of every
individual, and in doing our utmost to make
life in general haupier.
I first met the late Senator Wilson in a
smoking car, I think, a good many years ago.
We were bath comparatively young men. ie
was then, as he was to the last, a rollicking,
good-natured, big-hearted man. Larry Wilson
was never happier than when surrounded by
bis friends and doing something to cast a ray
of sunshine into the shadows and the dark
places. Although he was a great success as
a business man, I never heard it said that
he had done a dishonest act, in business or
elsewhere. His father was a Scotch Canadian
and his mother a French-speaking Canadiana combination that helped to make him not

MARCU 6, 1934
only beloved by the people, but very successfui ini his business, lie had the canninesu of
the Scotch and the vivacity of the Frenchi,
characteiristics that made hiim safe in business
and tjhe friend of ai with whom hie came into
contact.
As I have said, I knew him for a great
many years, and always feit better fer conversing wibh him. Hie was an example of
honesty and brightneiss and the entire absence
of mea-nness. I neyer heard of Larry Wilson
doing a mean thing ta any person; and ai:though bis business cafreer was chaiacterized
by keenneas, bis strict bonesty was always
outstanding.
liaving known him for so many years, I
feel bis passig ve'ry keenly, and I join
heartily with the right bonourabie leader of
the Governnenit -and the othar members of
this Flou-se in extending to Jais fa.miiy and
friends our sincere sympathy.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Ronourable gentlemen, it is as an o'ld f-riend of the
late Lawrence Alexander Wilson and as President of the Franco-Scottish Society of Montreal -that I wigh ùo render bomage ta bis
memnory. His death created in ail sections
of the community a surprise, a shock, for
Larry Wilson, as hae was affectionately called,
was known ail over Canada. He was a
self -made man, and through bis activities
and bis geniality bis naine soen became a
ho-usoehold word w.herever hie dweiit. lie wes
a born trader, and -if hae accumulated a large
fortune he owed it ta bis keen business sense,
and, above ail, tKabis fairness in dealing with
bis fellow men.
Hie was generou* as we ail know, and ta
those who somnetimes expressed surprise at bis
large donations to churches, universities, colleges, artists, municipalitlies and charitable
institutions generaily, bis only comment was:
"My fortune bas been built up with the aid
of the people; it is o-nly logical that ià shouid
return ta them."l In that cryptir sentence
you have the psalm of life of our late
colleague.
Let me add that nowhere in. the Dominion
will bis death be more regretted than in his
native province.
Ris very namne will recali to this Flouse
that the late L. A. Wilson was of Scottish
origin. Ris forbears were Seottish on bis
lather's side and French Canadian on bis
mother's side. The auid alliance betjween
Scotland and France, though dating back
many centuries, bas neyer been forgotten by
the descendants of both races in Canada. It
seems that there is a natural attraction, or
rather a natural affection, between the people
7472"àS

115

of those races. In London I once heard
Lord Strathcona recail the days early in the
nineteenth century when a Preshyterian congregation in Montreal, deprived of its cburch
through a fire, was given hospitality in the
old Récollet Church for its Sunday service.
We knoçw too that, clannish as they are, the
Scots and the French Canadians bave commingled, so much so that the habitants bave
practically absorbed the Highland-ers who
settled in old Quebec after the battle of the
Plains of Abraham in 1759. Truc, the Highlanders conquered the French on the Plains
of Abrabam, but when tbey disbanded and
founded settlements in French Canada, as
for instance at Murray Bay, where I spend
my summers, t.hey gradually adapted tbemselves to the cusgtome, traditions and language
broughit into their homes by their French
Canadian wives. Sncb is the romance of
the Frazers, the Stuarts, the Rosses, the
Campbeils, the MeNeils, the McPhersons, the
Warrens, the Maedonals and the Wiisons.
They are, as we know, a splendid people who
combine the physical and mental attributes
of two great races. The late Senator Wilson
often recalied in bis speeches the mnotta, of
the City of Aberdeen, "Bon Accord."
lie had for Sir Wilfrid Laurier a sincere
admiroition. and often quoted to young
students, as a guide in their lives, the f oliowing words from an add-ress deiivered by the
old chieftain in Lon-don, Ontario:
Let me tell you that for the solution of our
national problemse you have a safe guide, an
unfaiiing iight, if you rermember that faith is
better than doubt, and love is bet.ter than
hate. Banish doubt and bate fromn your life.
Let your soul be ever open to the strong
promiptings of faith and the gentle influence
of brotherly love. Be adamant against the
haughty; be gentie and kind to the weak. Let
your aima or your pýurpose, in good report or
in ili, in victory or In defeaýt, be so to live, so
to strive, s0 to serve, as to do your part to
raise the standard of if e to higher and better
spheres.
I am proud to say in this Chamber, whinh
bis smiling personality will adorn no more,
that Lawrence A. Wilson iived up to, that
noble ideal.
Hon. J. P. B. GASGRAIN: Honourable
members, as I am, 1 suppose, about the
oldest friend that the late Senator Wilson
had in the Senate of Canada, I may be
allowed to add a few words to what bas
already been se well said by the honourable
gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux). It is so long ago, that I firet met
Lawrence Wilson that 1 cannot remember
when it was, but what 1 do remember is his
wonderful personality. lie had a personality

116

SENATE

all bis own, and that helped him greatly.
He was sincere; hence he was absolutely independent.
Lawrence Wilson was a raconteur par excellence. I well remember how he could
coin words that would enrich any English
dictionary. He had a faculty of expressing
himself in a way that pictured exactly what
took place. When Sir Wilfrid Laurier would
come to Montreal, perhaps to attend a great
meeting in the Monument National, Lawrence
Wilson would ask me to invite Sir Wilfrid
to be bis guest for supper at the Windsor
Hotel, where Sir Wilfrid always resided when
in Montreal. There were many other people
who would have liked to be host to Sir
Wilfrid, some of whom even had a good supper
already prepared for him. I would say to
him, "Larry Wilson would like you to have
supper with him to-night." Then all I had
to do was to wave my hand, and Larry understood. He was a wonderful entertainer; in
fact no one could entertain more royally
than he, and the rôle of host gave him great
Joy.

Lawrence Wilson thought that day lost in
which he had not donc a good turn to somebody. He was always trying to scatter sunshine into the humblest homes round about
where lie lived. I often accompanied him on
bis calls. We would go into the home of a
poor family, and he would manage with great
delicacy to give some money to the mother
or father, and he always had some sweets
or toys for the children. After we got outside he would remark, "Well, they will be
happy to-day, anyway." Thus he passed from
place to place, doing good.
People do not fully realize the extent of
Larry Wilson's kindness, which was almost
proverbial. He was kind to all, including
those who were not bis friends in a strict
senise, though I would not call them parasites.
No one ever came to bis place who was not
received cheerfully and as though he were a
guest who would return the compliment the
next day. Everybody knows of Lawrence
Wilson's liberality to bis own native place,
Coteau du Lac, forty miles west of Montreal.
He had acquired and lived in a wonderful
residence there which had been built by Sir
John Simpson, of Hudson Bay fame. He kept
intact and enlarged upon the old bouse where
fie was born. Those who have visited
Coteau du Lac have seen the building. With
a view to making the people there happy, he
bought a lot of property and built a pavilion
which is unique. The grounds were deeded
to the municipality, and in addition to the
pavilion he had other buildings erected. At
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

meetings held there the crowds were estimated to total from five to ten thousand
people, and Larry Wilson would have refreshments for everybody. I never saw so many
automobiles in any other country place as I
have seen there. I remember that Sir Henry
Drayton came there on one occasion and delivered a speech in French, and the only
thing that worried Larry Wilson was that
Sir Henry would not finish his speech, he was
so intent on speaking in the language which
he said he loved so well. Amusements of
all kinds were provided, but these were so refined that the local clergy and even the nuns
were able to attend.
Senator Wilson must have had a wonderful
constitution, for during his three score years
and ten he really lived two lives. His activities in connection with bis business necessitated his keeping very late hours, but even
though he might not have been able to retire
before three o'clock in the morning, he would
be at his desk by eight o'clock for another
full day's work. Frequently he would do this
day after day.
Larry Wilson had the remarkable quality
of always being on friendly terms with his
opponents. Mr. John Dougall used to preach
temperance in bis paper, The Witness, and
would not accept theatre or wine advertisements, yet he and Larry Wilson had the
greatest affection for each other. Every birthday Larry would write bis friend wishing
him long life to continue his campaign for
what he thought was right. Larry Wilson's
was a rare personality, and I am confident all
the members of this House will join me in this
prayer. As Christians, who believe in a
future life, let us pray together that our dear
departed friend, secure in Peter's barque,
spreading its broad white sails to the blessed
breezes of hope and charity, will cross the
immense ocean of divine mercy to the enchanting shore of everlasting felicity.
HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
February 28, the adjourned debate -on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Barnard for the second
reading of Bill A, an Act with respect to
Hospital Sweepstakes.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, it was my intention early this session
to present a motion urging the Government
to operate a national lottery and use the
proceeds to finance a huge programme of
public works for the relief of our working
classes. This Bill was introduced before I

MARCH 6, 1934
could proceed with my proposed motion, but
as it covers the same principle, and the discussion has so far been mnainly on the subject
of lotteries, 1 shall take thiis occasion to make
a few remarks, first on lotteries ini general.
then on the present Bill, and, finally, to, outline the plan I had in mind.
Lotteries are not a modem institution-a
new method of distributing prizes, lots, obi ects,
even lands, and of levying nioneys. Many
centuries ago, in Egypt, they were practically
the only means used to, give each family the
parcels of lands to be cultivated, and the
tools for their cultivation. Over twenty centuries ago the Romans began many of their
festivities with lotteries. Italy is stili operating lotteries.
On their return from Italy the armies of
Louis XII brouglit the idea back to France.
Later on lotteries became sQ popular that in
1530 King Francis I gave a charter to one
Jean Laurent to organize as many lotteries
as he might dcsire, provided lie paid a yearly
fee of £2,000. In the seventeenth oentury the
English and the Venetian arinies were paid
in time of war by funds raised from lotteries.
Under King Louis XIV. of France five lotteries were in operation. It may be interesting to note that some of the largest and
most beautiful buildings in Paris *were bult
with the proceeds of lotteries--the churchee
of Saint Louis, Saint Roch, and the Daughters
of Saint Thomas, such buildings as the
Pantheon and the Military School,' and, many
others. In 1776 ail lotteries were a-bolished
in France and were replaced by the Royal
Lottery, which brought into the treasury
about ten millions yearly.
If mucli bas be-en said in favour of lotteries, if millions of people are enjoying this
mild mode of gamnbling, mucli bas also been
said and written against lotteries. The principle is claimed to be immoral and it is
urged that it encourages the spirit of gambling.
I will not disouss the subject on religious
grounds. A inatter of conscience is a personal riglit not to be den.ied or discussed.
But we have to take people as they are, if
not as they should be.
Are lotteries popular? The answer is given
by the resuits where loitteries are conducted
under the law, and sometimes against it.
Let us consider £,or a few moments the
arguments advanced against lotteries. The
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdodk) lias based, lis arguments mainly on
the circular issued by the Social Service
Council of Canada, and an article publislied
in the Mardi issue of the Readers, Digest,
entitled "The Return of Lotteries."1 The cir-

117

cular of the Social, Service Council was very
well answered by the honourable senator from.
Pictou (Hlon. Mr. Tanner) and it is needless
for me to repeat his argument. The honourable senator from Parkdale said:
In the Mardi issue of the Reader's Digest,
which I was looking througli the other day,
among many articles well worth reading, I
fo-und one entitled "The Return of Lotteries."'
I wiIýl not quote the entire article by any means.
The first sentence, which pretty well gives the
gist of the wehole thing, reade this way:
"Ljotteries were once labelled by Henry
Fielding as 'a taxation on ail the fools in
oreatio?."~

These are strong words, but are they a
strong argument? I am going to read the
whole article, and lionourable senators will be
able to draw their own conclusions.
The
article, which is loaded witli interesting facts,

proceeds:
Yet about thiirty govemnmentq in. the wor]d
to-day are conducting lotteries, and taking their
cuts as the moxst painlees form of taxation
possible in tisse times. And, surprisingly

enough, newiere is the lottery as overwielmingly successful as it is among the thrifty, goldloving, conservative French.
What with tie unbalanced budget, gold headaches, and so on, the French Government bias
been desperate in its se.arch for new revenues.
A lottery wae suggested.
Conservatives protested tint this formi of raising money belonged
to the primitive diays when Augustus and Nero

balanced tie Roman budget through lotteree.

The necessity of getting many f rancs 9sewhere,
and quivkly, finaily silenced. their arguments.
Even so the French Go(vernment began very
timidly, issuing only 200,0010,000 francs, or about
$17,000,000 worth of tickets on September 20,
1933.
The tickets were gobbled up by tie thrifty
French with auch feverish speed that even the
pro-lottery people were ainazed.
I would ask hono>urable members to pay particular attention to the following:
The French seized on the national lottery as
a new amusement with delir-ious entiusiasm,
and forget their troubles to speculate wildly
about their chances in this new, gay national
gaifne.
Here 1 pause to read this extract from the

Ottawa Journal of February 7, 1934:

At this point may I quote a dispatch which
appeared in the Montreal Star of Friday, September 29, 1933:
Italy's Profit From Lotteries More Than
$40,000,000 Yearly
Rome, Sept. 29.-Italy's Government makes a
considerable profit from the weekly state lottery,
which is estimated to bring in more than
500,000,000 lire ($40,000,000 at present rates)
a year into the state's coffers.
The actual figures for the past six months
show that the Government received from this
source no less than 263,000,000 lire ($20,000,000).
This weekly state lottery is an old and extremely popular institution in Italy and
thousands

of

poor

people

enter

it

regularly

every week. It has been calculated that the
pennies of the poor assure the continuance of
this handsome source of gain to the Government.
The lottery is held in eight of the chief cities
of Italy. In the first six months of the year
144,667,000 lire were paid out in winnings. The
system adopted is very simple and consists of
attempts to guess the five numbers between
one and nincty that are drawn in each of the
eight cities.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

The article in the Reader's Digest deals
next with Soviet Russia:
Soviet Russia is one country -wiliere the lottery
does not alppea-r to provide mioh fun. Everybody who buys a government bond is given a

ticket eligible for a cash prize. This is done
to cheer uep the Russian workers, because they
have to buy bonds, so much being taken eut
of their pay weekly for the purichase of these.
If they object they face the prospect of Ilosing
their food cards-starvation. On the day of
the drawings nemspapers and the radio flash
the winni-ng numbers of tickets which the workers poeketed with their bonds. But only a few
of the winners ever bother to collect their
winnings. They don't see any use in having
the money, because there is practically nothing
in Russia on wh-ich tbey eau spend it. As a
result the Soviet lottery treasury has unclaimed prizes amounting to 19,000,000 rubles
in iits coffers.
I wonder if the C.C.F. propagandists would

care to publish that paragraph?

on lorse-races and nost racing were rigidily
outlawed years ago after an infuriated track
crowd not only hacked the jockeys to pieces,
but a horse as well, because losers thought the

Mikado and his Elder Statesmen decided that
gambling and the Japanese temperament did
not mix.
Once the lottery was the Government's
favourite form of raising new levies in England, but under the questionably virtuous rule
of George IV a flock of Puritan scruples were
embodied in the Ast of 1826. To-day Englishmen are the greatest buyers of sweepetakes
and lottery tickets in the world, spending an
estimaited $200,000,000 a year on them. Lately,
bluff, hearty Sir John George S-terart-Murray,
Duke of Atholli, leading the battle for the
legalization of lotteries in Engliand, grew so
disgusted with seeing Englishmen send their
money to Ireland and Calcutta that he decided
to do sonething about it. He began to sell
flocks of tickets, with the sole explanation that
the proceeds would be "disposed of in such
mauner as the Duke of Athoîl shall, in his
absolute and uncontrolled disretion, see fit."
Exactly 337,000 Englishmen had so much faith
in the D-uke's discretion tihat tihey paid an
average of about $2.50 for the tickets. From
the proceeds His Grace gave $290,000 to needy

ingenious defense failedi, but he served notice
that he woulid continue his private war.
Once our forefathers of both dhurch and state
esteemed lotteries ýas a valuable institution of
our national ilife. George Washington, -in 1776,
bought one of the first tickets in the Continental Congress $5,000,000 Lottery, when Congress needed money to fight the redcoats.

119

MARCH 6, 1934
In those days public lotteries constituted the
most popular and effective method of 'raising
money for the worthiest causes. King's College,
now Columbia University, was founded directly
on the proceeds of a widely advertised lottery.
Harvard, Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth repeatedly invited the public to take a chance
for the benefit of higher education. John Hancock and Benjamin Franklin were among the
chief patrons of various gambles for public progress and improvements.
The popularity of lotteries reached a peak
during the Civil War reconstruction period in
the days of the Grand Extraordinary Louisiana
Lottery. Once a ticket in this gamble reposed
next to the small change in the old cracked
sugar bowl on the shelf in at least one out of
every four kitchens in the United States.
This is the lottery mentioned by the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hocken).
What was the reason for its abolition? It
was simply this:
The lottery promoters, a private corporation,
abused their privileges flamboyantly and extravagantly. At a time when the Louisiana
Company was doing a $28,O0,000-a-year business, the State collected only $40,000 annually
Louisiana clergymen and
as its revenue.
associated reformers broadcast news of the
greed and dishonesty of the Louisiana Lottery
promoters far and wide. Small merchants and
solid citizens from Maine to Mexico were told
time and again that if the nation's spenders
didn't pour $28,000,000 annually into the maw
of the lottery monster this money would go into
the tills of legitimate business. As a result
the Louisiana Lottery was exiled to Honduras,
by Act of Congress in 1893, and it eventually
died there because of the avarice and crookedness of the people who ran it.
There you have the explanation as to why
this lottery was abolished. It was a private
affair, and consequently greed, avarice and
corruption reigned.
However, increasing millions of dollars are
spent in this country every year for foreign
lotteries and sweepstakeE--not to mention other
millions spent on sub rosa lotteries operated
here. Why can't the laws against lotteries be
enforced in this country? The New York State
law holds that anybody who "participates" lu a
lottery is guilty of a misdemeanour. The giving of "any consideration" for a chance to win
a prize constitutes participation. If the Ladies'
Aid Society of a Baptist Chureh in Zion City,
New York, gives a charity entertainment,
charges no admission whatsoever, but nevertheless gives a "chance" on a crazy quilt to everyone wbo attends, is that a lottery? It certainly
is, under the law. Of course the law is never
enforced. If it were, many cof our leading
Catholie, Jewish, and Protestant clergymen and
laymen might go to gaol. A check-up shows that
churches, lodges and fraternities constitute
about eighty per cent of the lottery lamw violators in this country.
Now I corne to the argument of the right
honourable senator from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham).
The chief argument against the lottery la
that it destroys the citizen's sense of civic responsibility (his willingness to pay taxes with-

out hope of return) and breaks down the moral
fibre of the individual. Those opposed to lotteries can truthfully cite hundreds of cases of
men who won cash prizes, got drunk, beat their
wives, eloped with demi-mondaines, and finalily
died penniless.
L there any probability of a change in our
lottery laws? This winter Governor Ritchie
found revenues for unemployment relief in
Maryland inadequate. With his customary
forthrightness he now tells the Legislature be
wants to change the Maryland Constitution so
that sweepstakes can be operated by the State.
A vote by the people of Maryland next November on whether to permit a State sweepstakes
lottery is now pending. The Maryland experiment will be worth watching. However, the
probability is that our lottery laws will not be
changed unless those who believe the gambling
instinct should be legally curbed find their
future tax burdens too much to bear.

Now you have the whole article, and I
leave it to you, honourable senators, to decide
whether yeu will draw from it 'the same conclusion that the honourable senator from

Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) did.
I would not pass by the argument of the
honourable senator from Stadacona (Hon. Mr.

Webster), deduced from his study of the conditions created by lotteries in France. He
states that he was informed that the lotteries
were not beneficial to charitable institutions.

There is a good reason for that. The benefits
from lotteries are not for these institutions.
The article just read mentions that 40 per
cent of $140,000,000-that is $56,000,000-went
for pensions and farm relief. I should like
to know if our Western farmers, so hard bit
for the last four years, wouid not be thankful
for such relief.

The

honourable

sena.tor

was

especially

struck by the fact cited to him that many a

woman needing a new hat woulld rather buy
a chance to win a prize than purohase the
hat. As the honourable senator made his
visit to France just a few weeks ago, it may be
that these ladies had sense enough to refuse

to follow the fashion of wearing straw hats
during the winter-time.

But surely that is

not the main reason for a lottery doing a
business of $140,000,000 in a few months.
Honourible senators, the article I have just
read does not mention whast is taking place
in Canada, and that is what ehould initerest

us first and last. Under our Criminal Code
small lotteries may be operated for certain
purposes; certain gambling devices, forbidden
otherwise, are allowed to function in certain
places and on certain occasions. These sections of our Criminal Code are so well known
thatt it is not necessary to cite them. Why
this discrimination? It is simply because the
benefnts to the community are greater than
the possible danger.

120

SENATE

Where is the wrong? Lotteries are not sinful. No church, nor members of a church,
would use or advocate them if they were. So
we have to consider only the social side of
the question. The prcblem has been rightly
stated by the right honourable leader of the
Senate. He said:
And it seems to me that a very serious responsibility is taken by a legislature whieh puts
its imprimatur upon any practice, iiiiless it is
of the opinion that the practice is a good one
or that a restricted sanction of it would be
more effective than total prohibition in restraint
of indulgence.
He added:
I know there is gambling in everything. The
honourable senator behind me said that
gambling is in human nature and we shall never
get away from it. I believe that is truc.
He concluded:
So far as I am concerned personally, nothing
more need be said. We never can get the world
perfect. Some argue that tie sale of liquior
should be entirely probibited. They say that
because liquor is not good for society we ought
to muake its manufacture and sale a crime
and ban it wholly. Assuinîng their premises to
be sound, it does not follow that their remedy
is feasible. If the traffic cannot as a matter
of practical executive authority be banned, it
may be better to seek to control it within certain limits. Our purpose is not to encourage.
but rather to restrain the traffic, and we find
in practice that we can restrain it better by
laws of control than by attempting total prohibition. I must say that in the last few years
there bas been ample justification for this view
in the experience both of Canada and of the
country to the south.
It has also been stated that we should not
encourage our young men to believe that this
is just as fine a way of making a living as
any other. Is this not overstepping the mark?
You may gamble on the stock market, play
the races, drink, play the wheel at fairs, buy
lottery tickets at bazaars, and this every day
and as much as you wish, and there is no
wrong, no danger of teaching our young men
any bad habits; but let them buy a lottery
ticket three or four times a year in a lottery
controlled by the Government, and right there
and then, these young men are morally and
socially poisoned. This is a conclusion with
which I cannot agree.
Surely honourable senators are aware that
our laws against lotteries are openly violated
every day. Millions of tickets are sold and
purchased the year round, in Canada, and
millions of good Canadian dollars are lost to
our country. The sum has been estimated
at four or five million dollars. This amount
can be arrived at only when there is a fair
chance to check figures, and if you take into
account the large number of tickets sold and
never accounted for, how many more millions
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

will you find? It is an offence to purchase a
ticket; so if any one is defrauded he dare not
look for redress.
Is there a demand for lotteries. and is that
demand growing in intensity from year to
year? You have the answer right here in this
honourable Senate. Two years ago this Bill
would not pass the Senate, but last session it
went through. It is true that it was defeated
in the other House, but who can say what
will be its fate this year?
There was a conference some weeks ago
with the provincial governments, and for the
first time at such a conference lotteries were
on the agenda of matters to be discussed. It
is truc that there was no discussion on the
question, but the statement was given the
press that if it was brought before Parliament
it would be an open question and members
would be free of party allegiance in regard to
it. What is the result? We have this Bill
before us, and there is also one before the
Legislature of the province of Quebec. Is it
a satisfactory state of affairs to have a conflict between federal and provincial jurisdirtions in regard to the criminal law?
I have here a copy of the Quebec Bill.
Section 6 provides as follows:
6. Le pouvoir, attribué au lieutenantgouverneur en conseil par l'article, 1, n'est exercé
que si une loterie de la nature de celle visée
par la présente loi n'est pas prohibée par un
statut du parlement du. Canada.
Ce pouvoir ne peut non plus être exercé, si
!e parlement du Canada autorise le gouvernement canadien à organiser une loterie générale
dans tout le Canada pour des fins semblables à
celles prévues par les dispositions précédentes.
Honourable senators can see what is comIng.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Would the honourable gentleman kindly read in Englýish the
clause which he bas just read in French?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I have not had
a translation made, but I may be permitted
to give my own.
The power conferred upon the Lieutenant
Governor in Council by section 1 is exercised
only if a lottery of the nature aimed at by the
present law is not prohibited by a statute of
the Parliament of Canada.
Nor can this power be exercised if the Parliament of Canada authorizes the Canadian
Government to organize a general lottery in
the whole of Canada for purposes similar to
those provided for by the preceding sections.
The aim of the Bill is educational aid and
public assistance.
Hon. Mr. McRAE:
Would the honourable senator say whether that is a Government Bill?

MARCH 6,1934
Hlon. Mr. MARCOTTE: lIt is a Government Bill, of tlie Legislature of the province
of Québec.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: By whom was it
introduced ?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTT'E: Nobody will
question the fact that the Attorney-General
for the province of Quebec knows of the
existence of our 'Criminal Code. What is
coming I leave to you to guess. There is no
denying the fact that the de'mand of the
public for govei-nment lotteries is steadily
growing.
Let us corne to the present Bill. There is
one feature of it that 1 do not like. It makes
the lottery a provincial affair, limited to the
boundaries of any province. The Quebec
bill also is provincial in nature, but there is
no mention cf the territorial limits. You
will have a multiplicity of lotteries. We are
able to foresce the difficulties created by the
very clauses cf bhe Bill.
The -main objection to the many lotteries
which are bound to corne into existence is
the matter of expenses. Tliere will be different
f orms oif management, and numerous employees, as weil as salaries and commisions,
and printing and advertising expenses to be
paid. These will tend to reduce greatly the
share allotted to hospitals or universities.
This is confirmed lby the report of the Englîsh
Commission on Lotteries. It will also provide facilities for fraude.
1 should like to see the Federal Governmènt take control of a national lottery, whicli
could 'be called National Relief Works Lottery. Then biere wouid lie only one lottery,
the aim of which would be to give work to
our people liy a distribution among the provinces of public works, more especially those
calling for manual labour. In this way employment wouid lie given in the place of
direct relief. Much lias been said about the
necessity of giving our people work to do.
Unemployment has licen deplored, espeoially
in the case of our young people. Work is
desired, blit the obstacle is lack of funds.
Here is a way to secure the necessary money
without burdening our 'budget, which. already
is heavily loaded. This lottery would le
under the control o£ eitlier tlie Minister of
Finance or the Minister of Labour. lInstead
of sweepstakes, depending on the rest of
races abroad, drawings of lots could be made,
say four times a year, or oftener if desired,
on fixed. dates.
The printing of tickets, advertising cards,
pamphlets or any necessary literature could
lie done by tlie Government Printing Bureau.
The tickets could lie distriliuted through our
post offices. Tickets would lie bought and

121

sold like stamps, postal notes or money orders,
and the postmasters would be the selling and
collecting agents.
SAs there would lie only one lottery of an
officiai character, the drawing being under the
control of the Government, the tickets would
be well known and there would be no danger
of fraud.
Jn this way a multiplicity of lotteries would
be avoided. There would be no great costs
for salaries, publicity, commission on sales or
collections. These being reduced to a minimum, the share of the Government would be
larger, and the beneficiaries would be flot the
winners of the lottery, but the workers at
large.
This would not cost the Government or the
country one cent, and here is the reason.
Fixing the price of a ticket at one dollar and
the share of the Government at twenty-five
per cent-basing the amount of business on
results obtained in France, Italy, and Ireland,
not to mention other countries-I sulimit we
may fairly estimate the share of the Government at a minimum of six millions a year.
Six millions would be amply sufficient to
guarantee the interest and sinking fund on
a special boan of $50,000,000. The interest at
four per cent would amount to $2,000,000, and
$4,000,000 annually would form a sinking f und,
so that the whole sum would lie paid off in
a few years. If we believe that general conditions are improving, the spending of fifty
million dollars on special public works
throughout the country would give employment to those classes of labour which are in
need of work, and lie of immense benefit,
generally.
Each ticket should bear, as it were, a cheque
stamp of three cents. This would pay the
cost of printing the tickets and the necessary
literature. Postmasters would make no charge
for selling and collecting these tickets, this
being their contribution to the national relief,
or if it were deemed desirable they could lie
paid through the sale of the stamps.
It lias been stated and written that this
sort of gambling would tax the poorer classes
by inducing them to part with their little
spare money to buy tickets. Even so, it would
be to their benefit, for those who did not win
a prize would get work and wages--something
far more important than a lottery-winning
ticket.
:Every winning ticket could be taxed five
per cent or more on the amount, so won, this
sum to go to tlie Income Tax Department.
Any excess profits over the amount necessary for payment of interest and funded delit
could be applied by the Government to assist
liospitals and universities. or otherwise.

122

SENATE

By the elimination of expenses the profits
would be larger and a greater number of
prizes could be allotted.
According to the circular of the Social Service Council, placed on Hansard:
1. ilospitals received only one-seventh of the
anount wagered.
2. Prize money equalled approxinately onehalf.
3. The balance went to the sellers and to
"expenses."
That is, two-fourteenths went to hospitals,
seven-fourteenths to prize money. and fivefourteen-ths to sellers and overhead.
But even at that it is paying. Listen to
this dispatch from Sydney, New South Wales,
dated April 14, 1933:
When the 100th New South Wales State
lottery was drawn recently, the Director
annournced that the total profit realized from

the lotteries had been about $7,500,00q0.

This, lie said, was a complete vindication of
the system of assisting the hospitals by
lotteries.
The first lottery was drawn in August, 1931.
But under the present suggestion twentyfive per cent would go to the Government
and seventy-five per cent to the purchasers of
tickets. Expenses would be very small and
would be paid by the purchasers of tickets.
The real beneficiaries would be the workers
and consequently the community at large; for,
first, we bave work to give; second, the purchasing power of the worker being inereased,
our industries would get their share of
benefit; and, third, the works would remain
as a permanent improvement. Then the
provincial governments, not having to contribute to the payment of direct relief, would,
as in the past, be in a position to help their
hospitals and universities.
It bas been stated that this gambling
method of raising moneys cannot be countenanced by law; it is too dangerous. But,
honourable senators, which is the wiser policy,
to legalize a mild mode of gambling, controlled by the Government, well organized
and kept in check, or to let our working
classes starve to the point of despair? Which
is the more dangerous course for our young
people, to buy three or four lottery tickets a
year, or to stand by idly witnessing the
despair of their parents and with no hope
of a betterment of affairs for themselves?
In any event, lottery tickets will be bought
in this country. Why not control and use to
good purpose what cannot be stopped?
These are the things that I wanted to
submit for your consideration and the attention of the Government. The aim of the
present Bill is somewhat different from the
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE

objective I had in view, but even with its
defects the measure is a step in the right
direction.
For these reasons I shall repeat what I
have done on previous occasions, and support
the Bill.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
as I was sponsor for the Sweepstakes Bill
which was before this House last session, I
felt that my views on sweepstakes were so
well known and the subject had been so
thoroughly discussed that there was no necessity for my taking up the time of honourable members in restating my position. However the honourable senator from Essex
(Hon. Mr. Lacasse), when speaking in favour
of the Bill on Wednesday last, expressed the
hope that I would state my views again
before the debate was concluded and show
that I had consistently maintained the
attitude I voiced last session. I willingly
comply with bis request. Of course I shall
vote for the Bill. The reasons I advanced for
its adoption last year exist and are even more
urgent to-day.
That tie sentiment in favour of sweepstakes
1s growing throughout the country every bonourable member must know. I have made it
a point during the past year to inquire carefully from time to time as opportunity
offered, and it is my firm opinion that if a
plebiscite on sweepstakes were submitted to
the electors of my province the vote would be
three to one in favour of sweeps. The Premier
of one of our great provinces early in the
year expressed himself as favourable to sweepstakes for charitable and educational purposes,
and he speaks for the majority of the electors
of that province. I presume the same sentiment prevails throughout the country.
PIress reports following the conference of
the provincial premiers in this city in January
of this year indicaited that there is the possibility of a general discussion on this issue in
the other House. I agree with the honourable
gentleman from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte)
that this is not an ideal Bill, but I submit
it is in keeping with the sentiment whici bas
been built up in this country in favour of the
support of hospitals. As Le quite rightly eays,
it is a step in the right direction. I am hopeful that the Government of the day, if unable
to approve this B-ill, will see fit to submit at
the next general election a plebiscite on
sweepstakes, with a view to obtaining a true
record of the wishes of the Canadian people.
I fol'lowed very closely the debate whioh
took place on this question last week. I
wish to refer to only two points which, it

MARCH 6,1934
occurs ta me,. have not received the consideration they menit.
There has heen, in my humble opinion,
much mieunderstanding with respect ta the
net moneys which would be available for
bospitals under the Bill now before us. lu
this connection the honourable senator fraan
Parkdale (Hon. M.r. Murdock) read a letter
he iveceived frein the Social Service Council
of Canada. I believp the sarne letter wes
received by most honourable senators, alt.haugh I per.9oually was not favoured with
one. Appa.rently I was nalt on the preferred
list. This letter, which will be found in
Hausard at page 94 draws attention ta
the report of the Royal Commission an
batteries and Betting, issued in Landau,
England, in 1933, and gives figures in connection with the Irish Sweepstakes for the
years 1931 ta 1933. I tb'ink there must be
an errer tihere, because, as the report was
iasued in 1933, the Commission could not have
had before it the audiited statements giving
the percenitagets for that yeur. Therefore 1
take it that the report dea)ls with the years
1931 and 1932.
The Social Service Council says the Commissian's repart shows that hospitals received
only one-seventh of the amount wagered,
one-haîf was spent on prizes, and the
balance, five-fourteenths of all the money
ollected, was paid out to sellers and for overhead expenses. Apparently there is saine
serious istake in these figures. I hold in
my 'hand tibree puhlished, certified, audited
statemeuts of sweeps in 1930 and 1931. 1 may
say that these statements are made by Craig,
Gardiner and Company, chartered accauntants,
and carry unqualified auditors' certificates tu
the effect that they have examined the
accounts, receîpts and dishursements, and ohtainied ail the information and explanaitians
requircd, and that the report is a true copy.
Had 1 contemplated speaking on this Bill
I would have endeavoured to get the auditors'
stajtement tor t>he 1932 sweepstakes, which
The Royal1
undoubtedly is uow avaýilable.
Commission could nat have had these statement&--at lea8t, not for 1933, as that year was
not theu complote. However, the Etatemeut
for 1931 cornes within the peri-od on which
the Royal Commission reports.
The first auditars' report covers -the sweepstake on the Manchester Novembor handicap,
1930. This was a sinaîl sweep, the amount of
or
money collected being only £65l35,
roughly $3,300,000. The expenses of 10-84
per cent indlude aIl items except the payment of 7 par cent ta the Hospital Trust,
Limited, for pramating the sweep, making
the total expenses for this sweep 17-84 per

z

oent. T-here was paid to the hospital in this
instance only 20 per cent of the grass takings,
and 62-16 per cent was paid in prizes. This
year was not within the Royal -Commission's
period of inquiry, and the audited statement
i8 the most unfavourable one I have here.
Coming ta the auditors' report for the same
handicap in the following year, 1931, we find
a very much improved situation, no douht due
ta the fact that grass takings were mu-eh
larger, namely £2,941,851, which, expressed in
aur dollars, would give gross takings of about
$15,000,000 at to-day's rate of exchange. This
audited statement shows the general expense
reduced ta 6-60 per cent, which, added ta
the payment of 2-24 per cent ta the Hospital
Trust Lîmited, for promoting the stake, makes
a total expense of 8-93 per cent of the grass
takings. There was paid out in prîzes 66-07
per cent, and ta the hospitals 25 per cent of
the grass takings, whi*ch would be somewhat
Iess than $4,000,000.
The third statement ta which 1 naw refer
is most interesting. It is the auditars' report
for the sweepstake on the Derby for 193i1.
The takings in this case were £2,780,606 17s.
GId., a very tidy sum of slightly over $14,000,000 at ta-day's rate of exchange.
The total expenses in this sweepstake, including the payment ta the Hospital Trust,
Limited, the promoters, is only 6-80 per cent
of the takings. 0f the balance 68-20 per
cent was paid out in prizes and 25 per cent ta
hospitals.
These audited reports of twa, of the 1931
Irish sweeps show expenses ta be 8 per cent
instead of 35 per cent, or %4 as reported by
the Social Service Cauncil. And 67 per cent
was given in prizes, instead af 50 per cent,
While the payment ta hospitals on these two
big swceps, of the four hcld in 19J31, was 25
per cent of takings and nat 4 or 14 per cent,
as stated in the letter read by the honourable
gentleman fram Parkdale. As the figures I
have quoted are correct for the year 1931, it
is difficuit ta understand the increase in expense which would be ncessary in the year
1932 ta place the aggregate expenses for t.he
period in keeping with the findings of the
Royal Commission as reported by the Social
Service Council. The Commission cauld not
possihly have the figures for the year 1933,
which. is included in their report.
Honourable senators might well study the
list of hospitaqs and the percentages given ta
each which maIce up the contribution af
£697,424, or raughly $3,500,G00.
In this audited statement of the Derby
sweep for 19311I find in the list of distributions
the naine of the South Cork Infirmary-which

124

SENATE

was referred to last week by the honourable
the junior senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hocken).
This institution, got the sum of
£20.922 14s. 6d., or approximately a little over
$100,000 in our money to-day. Not a bad
little hospital contribution, particularly as
there is a North Cork Infirmary, which received the larger sum of £27,896 19s. 4d. Then
the City of Cork lying-in hospital got £10,461;
Fever Hospital, Cork, £24,409, and the Dental
Hospital, Cork, £6,974. So we find the City
of Cork hospitals got from this one sweepstake, the Derby, a total of £90,665 3s. Od.,
or more than $450,000. I understand Ireland
runs four sweepstakes a year.
The honourable the junior senator from
Toronto, speaking in the Senate on Tuesday, February 27, as reported in Hansard,
page 86, read an excerpt from the Irish
Times of Dublin (date not given) to the
effect that the Free State Government bas
not paid the Cork South Infirmary for the
period of two years-they must have been
1932 and 1933; and that at a meeting of the
committec the treasurer said the hospital owed
£3,249 and their position at the end of the
year would be impossible, as they would have
a deficit of £5,000. But that is not a bad
showing, considering what they had received
and apparently spent the previous year,
namely £20,000, obtained from sweeps. I
disagree with the conclusion of the honourable senator that the financial position of the
South Cork Infirmary indicates that hospital
sweepstakes have not accomAished the purpose for which they were inaugurated. Sweepstakes cannot be held accountable for the
Irish Government's failure to turn over the
proceeds to the hospitals.
I believe that the Irish Government have
recently put a special tax on and derive a
substantial revenue from hospital sweeps. This
tax of course might account in part for the
discrepancy between the figures given by the
Social Service Council and the facts disclosed
by the certified audits as to the expense of
conducting sweepstakes.
I have given a great deal of thought and
have made many inquiries in an effort to
arrive at a fair conclusion as to the sum a
single lottery would provide for the hospitals
in British Columbia. I think most people
feel that the amount of money paid out for
prizes in the Irish sweeps is unnecessarily
large. Fifty per cent, or one-half of the takings, would be just as satisfactory as 67 per
cent, or two-thirds, which is the average of
the two 1931 sweepstakes for which I have
auditors' reports. Under the direction of an
honorary board of citizens the expenses
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

should not exceed 10 per cent. If 50 per
cent of takings is allowed for prizes, there
remains 40 per cent for hospitals. Under
proper organization, the takings of sweepstakes
in British Columbia should amount to at least
$5,000,000, the larger portion of which would
come from sources outside of Canada. Forty
per cent of these takings would mean $2,000,000
net for our hospitals in British Columbiamore money than they ever dreamed of getting in a single year, and more than they will
need for any continuons period of years. That
is why in my original proposal last year I
included the sick, destitute and maimed.
As a further evidence of the money these
sweeps would provide for our hospitals, allow
me to read an extract from the Australian
Press Bureau, of November 6, 1933, with regard
to Australia's State Lotteries:
Sydney (Australia) ... More than $12,500,000
has been expended on hospitals in Queensland
in recent years; 88 maternity hospitals have
been equipped and constructed in provincial
towns; $600,000 is now available for the humediate construction of a new naternity hospital
at Brisbane. All the ioney for this work lias
been obtained' froin the State's lottery.
These details were given by the Queensland
Home Secretary, who said the State lotteries
hbd, enabled the Government to provide baby
clinies. child welfare centres, and dental services for children and the unemployed.
So much for the financial advantages of
these sweeps. I do not think that part of the

question is open to argument.
I now come to the second point. I refer
to the moral side, which has been dealt with
at such length in this debate. The honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) when opposing this Bill disclaimed any
holier-than-thou attitude. Personally I have
nothing to say in that regard except that I
do not plead guilty to the accusations of
the holier-than-thou people who passed judgment on me in connection with a similar
measure last year. I fear they are the same
professional reformers who set back the cause
of temperance for at least a generation. I

am net uninindful of the fact that the Church
dominant in the Irish Free State bas not
raised its voice against sweepstakes. I am
one of those who believe in taking .things
as you find them, not as you would wish
them, and then making the best you can of
the situation; and that is the way I face this
issue.
There is no use in shutting our eyes to the
situation in this Dominion with regard to
sweepstakes. It is a notorious fact that the
practice of purchasing tickets in foreign
sweepstakes is tremendously on the increase.
The great majority of my acquaintances buy

MARCU 6, 1934
tickets, and many tickets, each year. Hundreds cf thousands -of dollars 'cave this country 'by devicus routes and find their resting
places largely in Ireland and India.
The honouraLble senater frem Stadacona
(Hon. Mr. Webster) says he was in Paris
last month and found the people who patronized the lotteries were net the wealthy people,
but the poor and the working classes. I was
in Paris, toc, a few weeks before hlm, and
was very mucli taken with the smocth working
of the letteries as 1 saw theni. While every
frîend I met in Paris appeared te have
iotitery tickets, I based my conclusions on the
presa reports, which gave the occupations cf
the winners. Taking these reports as indicative of the people who were buying the
lottery tickets, 1 found that in sweepstakes,
as in every other undertaking, business or
sport, the great midldle ciass, about which
you hear se little these days, carried the
burden. One th-ing that impressed me was
the gala night and the interest and amusement which accompanied the drawting in
Paris, confirming the entertaining feature
which was se ably put befere us by the
honourable senator frein DeLanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) last session.
1 listened with great interest te the very
devout address made by the henourable
senator fromn King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) on
Wednesday last, in which. he referred te the
gangster reign in Chicago. He might have
proceeded a step further te the super-gangsters,
the abductors fer ransom, who are challenging the personal liberty cf the Americans
and thus shaking democracy te its very foundation. What are these gangsters the product
of? Of a law forced on a people by a
minority-legislatîon which the great majority
wouid net suport. There can be ne stronger
example cf the futility, yes, the positive
harm, cf passing legislation which the majority of the people will net approve or live
up te. The violation cf the l8th AmencLment
by the great mai ority cf the citizens of the
United States brought about that disregard
for Iaw and order te which the honeurable senator Teferred. Legislation whdch has
flot the approval of a large majority cannot
be successfully enforced. Law violation brings
disgrespect for aIl law.
What is being doue about the violation cf
section 236 cf the Criminal Code, which this
Bilà proposes te, modify? Once in a whle,
very selom indeed, we hear cf nome poor
chap being fined 820 for having a lotitery
ticket in his possession. But in any effort
mnade Vo sirrest and fine the tens cf thousands
cf us who buy lotttery tickets every year?
There le haTdly a club, men's or women's,

12Ô

in this country where the members cannot get
tickets fr-om some of the exnployees. At
swell clubs, littie clubs, big clubs, barber shops,
manicure shopis, beauty parlours and hundreds
of other places bh.roughout the Dominion
tickets of fureign sweepstakes can be and are
being prccured. Ls anybhing being dune about
it? Not a thing. After the drawing of every
big sweepstake yeu will see a list of the
wmnners published in our p.ress. They must
have bo-ught tickets. They are violating section 236 cf the Criminal Code. Is anyth-ing
done about it? Not a thing.
The only action sometimes invoked is unde~r
paragraph 3 of section 236, whereby the informer against th~e winner gets the prize
money-a proceduLre, indeed, which 1 would
hardly say la consistent with the high moral
attitude cf many cf the opponents of this
measure. The net resuat, cf course, in tha~t
the winnor must immediately get his uncle
or his aunt te bring suit against him and thus
forestail the cuiprit who wc&ild otherwise get
his Illegad prize money. That is oertainly on-'
peint cf tihe Criminal Code which shculd be
repealed. If te win a sweepstake is te continue te be a breach cf the Criminal Code,
then it shculd be the duty cf the AittorneyGeneral cf the province to take action, and
the money if forfeited should go to the State.
1 arn disappointed that some cf the honourable senators who se strcngly oppose the Bill
have flot introduced an amendmnent to correct
this ridicuicus situation.
We have -heaird a gcod deal about provincial
rights, and now we niay have et least one
province ccnsidering sweepstakes on its own
account. What is gcing te happen if a province decides te authorize sweepstakes? Is the
Attorney-General cf that province, a niember
cf the Government which authcrized the
sweeps, gcing to ihterfere? Will the Fedeiral
Governmient deny the use cf the mails, or
will the Pcst-master General, in wihose discretion this matter resta, decide that the mails
shall carry the lottery tickets only in the

reason. to believe that is what niight be done,
but is it practicable? The mails to-day, netwithstanding subsection d of section 7 of the
Poest Office Act, carry tickets to and fro in
connection with foreign lotteries. We have
net heard of anyone being prosecuted because
tickets have been picked up by the postal
authorities.
We have heard considerable in t.his debaite
about protecting the youth of the country.
This, I subrnit, hoinourable gentlemen, cau
best be done by precept, example and educatien, not iby prahibitory legislation which in

126

SENATE

of the people of this country are in favour of
sweepstakes and that no government has the
courage to enforce the present Act. Why not
recognize thiis fact and legisla;te accordingly?
It is a dead letter. Sweepstake betting cannot
be eradicated. It should be controliled, regulated, and, like the liquor business, made to
pay something either directly or indirectly
to the State.
I do not think I can close my remarks better
than by quoting the last paragraph from the
speech of the right bonourable leader of this
House (Right lon. Mr. Meighen) on February 28. Hlis words ean be applied with
equal force to sweepstakes. He said:
We never can get the world perfect. Some
argue that the sale of liquor should be entirely
prohibited. They say that because liquor is not
good for society we ought to make its manufacture and sale a crime and ban it wholly.
Assuming their prernises to be sound, it does
not follow that their remedy is feasible. If
the traffic cannot as a inatter of practical
executive authority be banned, it may be better
to seek to control it within certain limits. Our
purpose is not to encourage, but rather to
restrain the traffic, and we find in practice that
we can restrain it better by laws of control
than by attempting total prohibition. I must
say that in the last few years there has been
ample justification for this view in the experience both of Canada and of the country to
the south.
The sooner we deal with this issue the
sooner we shall make progress to the end
that I know is fervently desired by all honourable members, that is, te guide and protect
the rising generation and the weak-willed
members of the community.
Hon. J. P. MOLLOY: Honourable senators,
for reasons best known to myself I have been
for a considerable period of time a sillent
voice in this Chamber. I have played the
part of MacMillan's owl. He had an owl in
his store, and a customer one day asked him
if the bird ever spoke. MacMillan answered,
"No, he never speaks, but he's a devil to
think." So on my part, although I have net
spoken, T have trained myself to be a fairly
good thinker and an attentive listener, and I
have paid very close attention to every word
spoken by every honourable member in this
Chamber.
When the honourable the junior member
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hocken) discussed
this Bill he divided his remarks into two sections-the Louisiana Lottery and the demoralizing effect that the enactment of this measure
might have upon many of our young people.
As to the Louisiana Lottery, as explained by
the honourable member from Ponteix (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte), the lottery was discontinued
because its management became corrupt.
Hon.

Mr. MeRAE.

With respect to the denoralizing effect of
participation in lotteries, I do net agree with
the views of the honourable the junior memLer from Toronto. No one can convince me
that the spending of from one to five dollars
by any good citizen of this country to purchase a lottery ticket will tend to his demoralization and that of his family and neighbours.
I wonder if the honourable senator bas ever
been shocked by the hopeless outlook of those
of our fellow citizens who have lest their last
nickel and mortgaged their future by gambling on the stock exchange, the grain exchange,
the mining exchange or similar institutions. I
admit that sweepstakes are a gamble. But so
are operations on the stock exchange, the
grain exchange, the mining exchange. In fact
everything that we do from the time we get
up in the morning until we go to bed at
night is a gamble.
The right honourable member from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) in the course
of his remarks on this Bill expressed his deep
concern for the youth of this country. And
well he might. The youth of this country
need all the attention that the right honourable member and his friends-and I am one
of them-are quite willing and eager to give
them.
Our youth to-day do net conduct
themselves better than, indeed perhaps net as
well as, the youth of the Irish Free State,
where lotteries are conducted at what we
might term the very threshold of their homes.
We have done certain things, net connected
with sweepstakes, which have not been conducive to the elevation of our youth. Let
me cite our prohibition legislation. Has prohibition tended to the elevation of the youth
of this country? I submit it has net. On
the contrary, it has encouraged them to
violate the law. They violated the law by
purchasing illicit whiskey from those who were
in league with the bootlegger.
But conditions in this respect were even
worse in the United States. Arthur Brisbane,
a
prominent American newspaper editor,
went se far as to say that prohibition was such
a curse that some of the best fathers and
mothers preferred te make their own whiskey
rather than let their children run the risk
of being poisoned by drinking the product
of the bootlegger at public or semi-public
gatherings. I say that prohibition has done
more harm to the youth of Canada and the
United States than all the sweepstake tickets
that could be issued by reason of the enactment of this law.
Something else is taking place in this
country and in the United States as a result
of the invention of the automobile. I have

MARCH 6, 1934

We also have legalized divorce in this country, as we have a right to do, and aur divorce
law is fairly adrninistered; but I for ane,
honourable gentlemen, think it is a shame
and a scandai that in this country, the fiairest
in the universe, thoere should 'be such a thing.
I cannot change it, however, and therefore
shall make .no particular effort to do so.
But, in view of the prohibition ]aws of the
past and the divorce law of the present, let
no man tell me that the enaotment of a law
which would permit a poor man to invest
one dollar in a lottery would make hlm a
crirninal.

The honourable mem-ber from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) is very much worried
about the elected representatives in the other
Bouse. I may say ta himn that I was associated with that very honourable body for
a longer time than he was, and that during
my time there were what I might term the
elected members and the selected members of
that House. This is a distinction without a
difference. My experience in the other House
was that many, perhaps a mai ority, were
alwayseager and anxious to be on the wirrning
side.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: I am not of that
particular type myself. When I was in the
other Bouse I followed my leader and my
party. I knew that if my party was right
My leader was right. If my party was right,
how could he be wrong? So I simply stuck.
I do not agree with the increased number of
parties of late years. When I was in the other
Bouse there were two parties, and two only.

BILL

FIRST READING

Right Hon. Mr. ýMEICIIHEN' introduced
Bilil E, an Act respecting Shipping.
H1e said: The 1-buse will remember very
weII that last session we had before us two
bis respecting shipping-, one affecting shipping in inland waters, and the other shipping
beyond those limita. Both were before the
Commnittee on Banking and Commerce-or
was it the Committee on Railways, Telegraphis and H3,rbours?-and received long consideration.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I think it
was the Committce on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN: Perhaps it
wàs. The commibtees are pretty much the
saine except for the Chairmen. As I say, the
bis received long consideration, and ranch
evidenice was heard.
The larger Bill was
finally withdrawn, and the one respecting
inland waters shipping was passed, and is
now law. although it bas net been called
into effeet.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

It is flot law.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN:
It is suspended law.
As I arn now introducing the second Bill
in modified form, it behooves me to explain
brielly the modifications. The reason the
main mea.sure xvas withdrawn hast session was
that, while in pursuance of the procedure
outlined in the Statute of Westminster it
became the part of Canada to repeal as
respeots Canadian shipping the laws of the
United Kingdom
which. theretofore had
applied to Canada, and te enaet a shipping
haw of our own, it was necessary before we
could depend upon the efficacy of our own
law in ail parts of the world te, impose certain duties upon officiais beyond the juonsdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Those
duties, however, could be imposed only by
the respective governments of tbe United
Kingdom and of the Dominions, and there
hiad not been on their part any undertaking
that such laws would be passed, nor any
R;ght i-on. Mr. MEIGHEN.

îînd r-tarnding a~s te their forru, sufficient to
c n ibl
us te depend upon the protection
usSential in the application of our law. Consequently it was recommended, on the advie
of ceunisel for the Committee, that \wC sbould
net eut ourselves adrift from the protection
of the British Acts until we were quite
certain that we could depend upen legislntien by the other Dominions, lest we should
find oiîrselves in a cul-de-sac, without the
protection of any efficacieus law.
The prese-nt Bill is very much along the
hune of the previeus one, but in-stead of presuming te ca.st duties upon parties beyond
the pale of the legislation of Canada, as the
other one unfortunately did, it is made permissive in that regard; and then there is a
suspensory clause which keeps us under the
existing British Acts until it is possible for
this new Act to become effective as a result
of steps on the part of other Dominions te
impose duties which we cannet impose. The
intention ds that the new Act, if passed by
Parliament, shall be called inte effect when
we feel that enough has been doue te give
real legishative sanction te the eperation of
maritime law, as applied te our own shipping,
in sufficient parts of the world.
It will ho some little time before the Bill
is prdnted, as it is of extraordinary leugth
and contains considerable interlineations. I
have introduced it to-day se that the printing may be begun and the Bill read the
2
second time as soon as possible and then
referred te the Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I inquire
whether there is any connectien between the
re-introduction of this Bill and the peatpouement of the proclamation bringing the
Inýlaud Waters Act inte operation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN_1: Net that I
know of. I do net think there is the slightest
connectien. If the right honourable gentleman asks me why the Inlaud Waters Act
bias net been brought into operation, I shiaîl
hiave te request a delay before making a
reply.
Hon. Mr. -CASCRAIN: Perhaps I might
auswer the
righit honourable gentleman.
Some gentleman from the West slipped in
at ýthe end an amendment providing that
it should ceme into force only by proclamation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN'': Oh, I do net
tbink se. I think that that provision was in
there from the beginning, -and aise in the
previeus Act.
The Bill was read the first time.

MARCH 7, 1934
HUDSON

BAY SHIPPING COSTS

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable members, I am rising before the Orders of the
Day are called, to refer to a matter of
urgency. Companies with which I am connected have for some time been making
charters for ships, and in the Montreal
Standard of the 3rd of Maroh, last Saturday,
there is an article which I wish to read. As
honourable members know, considerable negotiations are necessary in the chartering of a
ship; you cannot go about it as if you were
hiring a taxi. So I am taking the liberty of
calling attention to this newspaper article, in
order to give the Government notice of what
is going on. It reads as follows:
Every Bushel of Wheat from Hudson Bay
Route Cost Government $1.23
(Montreal Standard's Parliamentary Correspondent at Ottawa). Ottawa, March 3.-For
every bushel of wheat shipped via the Hudson
Bay route last year, the Dominion Government
expended $1.23. And about the same the year
before.
Wheat shipments from Port Churchill in
1932 totalled 2,700,000 bushels. To permit this
movement of grain the Government's expenditures on the Hudson Bay route for the year
amounted to $3,328,000.
This sum would have paid the combined lake
and ocean freights on 40,000,000 bushels of
grain from Fort William to Liverpool at the
rates prevailing during the period last summer
when the Hudson Bay route ws open to
navigation.
The Hudson Bay Railway, the Port Churchill
developments and the aids to navigation in the
Strait, cost $53,000,000, entailing annual interest charges of $2,650,000.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I rise to a point of
order. Is this a matter of urgency?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Orders of the
Day have not yet been called. The article
goes on to say:
Maintenance costs of $414,000 and operating
deficit of $163,000 brought the total Government disbursements up to $3,328,000 last year.
This does not include provision for sinking
fund or expenses of icebreakers.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Mr. Speaker, are we
interested in this matter?
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
of order.

There is a point

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: What is the honourable
gentleman speaking to? Is there a motion
before the House? We have already disposed
of the first reading of the Shipping Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Orders of the
Day have not been called.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:
of urgency.
74728-9à

This is not a matter

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Companies that
I am connected with have been chartering
ships for a long time. They have to make
chartersHon. Mr. GILLIS:
If the honourable
gentleman wants to bring a matter to the
attention of the Chamber he should give notice
of it. This is not a matter of urgency.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is the opinion
of the honourable gentleman. In my opinion
it is of great urgency. There is only one
more short paragraph in the article:
If the shipments from Churchill were increased ten times to 27 million bushels the
interest charges would still constitute a transport subsidy of ten cents a bushel, or more
than the combined lake and ocean freight via
Port Arthur and Montreal for the greater part
of last season.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I had never
heard the figures which the honourable gentleman has given us. If it were not for the
unimpeachable character of the authority he
has quoted, I should not have believed them.

DISCUSSION

POSTPONED

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the question proposed by Hon. Mr. Murphy:
To call the attention of the Government to
the work of the Senate and to the efforts made
by the Senate to secure the initiation in this
House of Government measures, and to inquire
if it is the intention of the Government to
introduce in the Senate at an early date any
of the legislation indicated in the Speech from
the Throne.-Right Hon. Mr. Graham.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, as I explained previously, my object
in moving the adjournment of this discussion
was to keep the matter open until the honourable leader of this side of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) is present, as he wishes to
speak on it. I suggest that if no. other
honourable member desires to speak to-day,
the order should stand until to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I desire to
speak myself, but the honourable leader on
the other side has the floor and I shall be
satisfied to have the debate adjourned until
he is able to be present. However, I am
quite sure that it would be agreeable to him,
as to me, that any honourable members speak
to-day who care to do so. I may say that
we have a very important meeting of the
Banking and Commerce Committee resuming
immediately after the House adjourns; so
most of us will be busily occupied during
the afternoon in any event.
The Order stands.
The Senate adjourned until to-raorrow at

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill A, an
Act with respect to Hospital Sweepstakes.
Hon. Mr. MeLennan in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-Attorney-General
of
provincie may autiorize
sweepstakes
hospitals within that province:

any
for

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, the second reading of this Bill was passed
by a substantial majority, and I presume that
every honourable member, whether favouring
or opposing its principle, hopes that the Bill,
if enacted, may help to lighten the heavy
burden now borne by every province with
respect to hospitals. But I would have the
scope of the measûre enlarged so as to
empower the province of Quebec to apply the
proceeds of sweepstakes for the benefit of the
Universitv of Montreal. Without doubt that
is the most pressing need now confronting our
province. I hope the honourable sponsor of
the Bill wil'l see no objection to the amendment. I beg to move, seconded by Honourable Mr. LEspérance:
That in line 15 of section 2 there be added
after the word "hospitals' the words "university
or universities."
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Chairman, I do
not know that I altogether like that amendment. I arn not opposed to the province being
able to give, say, a portion of this money
to universities, but there may be other
charities to which it would like to give money.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
ernment?

The Provincial Gov-

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. As I understand
it, the matter is entirely under the control
of the Provincial Government. I quite understand the need of the province of Quebec as
far as universities are concerned, but I foresee
that in some other provinces where there
are State-maintained universities there may
be no such need at all. To judge by what
the honourable member from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) said the other day, it is
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

quite possible that one of these sweepstakes
will provide more money than is required.
It seems to me that the Bill should be made
a little broader; that the Government of a
province should have the right to devote such
portion of the funds as it thinks advisable
to education or to any other purpose which
it deems fit.
Furthermore, I am inclined to think that
we should keep in mind what bas been referred to as the main object of the Bill. I
think we will all agree that the maintenance
of hospitals, the care of the sick, and that
sort of thing, are very desirable, and I should
like to see it provided in the Bill that the
moneys derived from sweepstakes, or at least
a portion of them-I should be inclined to
say at least fifty per cent-shall be definitely
earmarked for hospitals.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
used for election purposes.

They might be

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not know that
the governments might not be permitted to
use them for campaign purposes.
We all
remember the discussion that took place last
year as to the necessity of campaign funds,
and the method of raising them. It was also
suggested at that time that the State should
furnish these funds. I do not know that it
would not be a good idea to have them come
out of the sweepstake moneys. However, my
main point is this: though I am not committing myself for the moment, I am inclined
to think that a definite proportion of the
funds derived from sweepstakes should be
devoted to hospitals.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
governments.

By

the provincial

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
By the provincial
governments. Then let them do as they sec
fit with the remainder.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Although I voted for
the second reading of the Bill, its scope is
not such as would commend itself to me,
because in the province from whieh I come
the public hospitals are supported by a general assessment upon real estate. For instance,
there is a general assessment upon our homes
and other buildings to provide for the maintenance of public hospitals. I may say in this
connection that the assessment for hospitals
is greater than the assessment for police or
fire protection. Consequently, there is no
necessity for collections or drives to raise
money for hospitals, and they are not in debt
at the end of the year.
I do not think that even the amendment
proposed by the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) goes far

MARCH 8, 1934

enougli. I think fthc Bill sbould be wide
enougli in ifs scope te enable a provincial
government, if if should be thouglit desirable
fa bold a sweep, te devote the proceeds fa
any charitable purpose if rnay sec fit.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: In reply to, the
honourable gentleman who has jusf taken his
seat, 1 would point ouf that if the funds were
f0 be made available for auy charify thaf
mighf choose f0 apply for them, fthc position
of the Governýmenf, or the official administering fbe fund, would ho intolerable. As we al
know, there are hundreds of charities of different kinds, some of importance and some
of much less importance. Most of us who
arc, or dlaim te be, decent citizens have our
own pet charifies. The resuilt would be that
aIl kinds of influence would be brouglif f0
bear on flic Attorncy-General or the administrator of thec fund te induce hima f0 make
grants for charifies which in many cases really
did not need fhem.
iFurthermorc, if must be remembcred that
this fund is f0 be admiuistered under regulafions drafted by the Attorney-General, assisfed,
1 presumne, by bis colleagues in fbe Government, and 1 f hink thaft in designating two
specifie objeets we are going quite far enough.
If a large amount of money should be realized,
as bas been suggested, and if the hospifals
and unix ersities were already provided for,
governmenf funds would be available for oflier
purposes. So we are really arguing in a circle.
I arn quit e prcparcd te accept the amendment
of flic honourable gentleman from Monfarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien), but I think if would be
a mistake f0 attempt f0 broaden the scope of
the Bill any furfber.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In the province of
Saskafchewvan, for example, we bave but the
onc unix ersity, and if is mainfained enfirely
by fhe, province. I have no doubt that condition will continue.
On fthc other baud
consider our hospitals. Wc bave a small
number of privaf c hospifals which. are managed by corporations and which, I f hink I
arn riglit in saying, belong for the most part
to the sisters of fthc Roman Catholie Churcli.
In addition, we bave in cifies like Regina,
Moose. aw and Baffleford, municipal hospitals,
such as, I undersfand, are esfablisbed in the
province of Ncw Brunswick, and ahl these
hospifals are regularly mainfained by taxes,
flot only from our cities, but from our towus,
villages and rural municipalities as well. The
total amount received by all such hospitals
frorn private contributions is very small
indeed.
.Now, assume thaf this Bill is passed and
thaf the province of Saskatchewan doter-

133

mines to establish a lottery. If that loftery
produced a great deal of money, what would
bo donc with it? The present systcma of
maintaining the hospitals by means of taxation appeals to me as a good one, and I
feel if should flot be disturbcd. We must
remember that conditions in various provinces
differ. If we arc going to pass legisiaf ion
permifting the governments of the provinces
to raise money by sweepstakes, we should
leave it fo those governments f0 decide what
they will do with the money.
Hear, hcar.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And I say we should
nof write into thc Bill fthe specifie purposes fa
whieh the money should be applied. Suppose
some millions of dollars werc raised annually
hy sweepstakes in my own province of
Saskatchewan, I shold not object af ail if
the Goverument uscd part of that money to
reduce provincial dcbt. Most of our provinces are at the present time scriously handicapped by lack of revenue, and if part of
fthe proceeds of sweepstakes were applicd f0
general debt reduction we should only be
following the practice of other countries about
which the honourable gentleman from Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) fold us the other day.
As conditions in the various provinces differ
greatly, if seems wise f0 beave eutirely f0
flic respective goveruments the question of
what f0 do wit h any rnoney raised by
sweepstakes.
Hon. Mr. ýMACDONELL: Honourable senators, apparenfly thé view now held is that
any moncys raised by sweepstakes should not
be earmarked for hospitals, but mighf be used
for education or any other purposce thaf the
provincial gove.rnmenfs deemed necessary.
Therefore I think if mighf be well fa change
the tif le of the Bill by eliminating fthe word
"Hospital" and subsfifuting perhaps the word
"Provincial," or any term thaf mighf be
thought more suifable.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn afraid if
is a bad Bill. If is going f0 cause trouble.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I think we have nof
had time f0 f-rame an amendment tbaf would
meet the suggestion of fthc bonourable member from Saltcoafs (Hon. Mr. Calder). As I
arn in favour of that sugge.stion, I tbink we
ouglit te take time f0 prepareý an amendmcnt.
This is f00 important f0 be rusbed flirougli.
H.on. Mr. MûRAE: 1 move tbat the Committee rise and report progress, and ask leave
f0 sit again.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I bave no
particular objection fa that, Mr. Cbairman,

SENATE
but I really do not see the ncessity for it.
I should prefer the Committee to make progre-ss now, but I am not pressing the matter.
There is no difficulty about framing an amendment to meet any view the Committee may
have. Personally I could net make this a
good Bill in any way. The suggestion of the
honourable member from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) is simply that the measure be
enlarged to include universities as beneficiaries of sweepstakes; and the honourable member from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) suggests
that one-half the proeeds of sweepstakes be
devoted to hospitals and the other half to any
purposes that the Government might determine.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That the Provincial
Government might determine.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It means the
Provincial Government. If the Committee
wishes to give expression to that or any other
view, it would be the work of but a few
minutes to prepare an amendment. Personally,
being opposed to the measure, I should like
to see its purpose limited, because by limiting its purpose we limit participation in
sweepstakes. I must repeat that I see no
necessity for the Committee to rise just now.
I may say that I have some letters of conmendation-for my opposition to the measure,
not for the reasons I gave; also letters of
criticism from two or three cowardly yaps,
wlo did not sign their names. I make that
remark only in the hope that in some way
the definition will reach them.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, there is of course the danger that the
Bill may not be passed if we widen its scope.
It was an enlargement of the list of
beneficiaries which killed the previous measure.
The question is how far the sweepstakes door
is going to be opened. If we open it too wide,
people may object on the ground that we shall
be having sweepstakes throughout the year.
The sponsor of the Bill, the honourable
gentleman from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard),
objects te any widening because of this very
danger. Therefore I have made my amendment as narrow as I possibly could make it
with a view to the present needs in the
province of Quebec. However, I recognize
very weill that the needs are different in the
various provinces, and if the intention is to
increase the number of beneficiaries of sweepstakes I would strongly urge that we should
net restriot the provincial governments to
spending on hospitals alone any money received
as a result of this measure. In the province
of Quehe most of the hospitals are maintained
Right

lon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

hv the Public Charities Fund. I thinlk I read to
the House last session a list of no fewer than
fifty of them. In other words the people are
paying, through taxation, for the upkeep of
these institutions. Weh, if this Bill is passed
and the Government of Quebec decides te
establish sweepstakes, why should it be obliged
to apply the receipts to something for which
the publie is already paying freely?
It seems to me, honourable members, that
we must cither limnit the application of this
measure or make it wide enough to include all
charitable, educational and philanthropie purposes. If the second course is choen. then the
Government of each province will be frce to
us0 the funds according te their local needs.
I have made my amendment narrow because
I did net want to hinder the passing of the
Bill. The priniciple of the measure has been
adopted by the Senate by a substantial
majority. Personally I am sorry that that
is se, but we cannot always have thiings our
own way. However, in view of this action
l)y the Sonate, I feel that I should not he
justified in put-ting any obstruction in the
path of the Bill, and for this reason I have
restricted my amendment to include the
giving of aid te ouîr universities.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am inclined to think
that that is a somewhat narrow view. The
honourable member speaks only for his own
province. Of course, he lias a right to <lo
that, but at the same time he must consider
the conditions that exist in other provinces.
It is proposed that this Bill shall be. net
purely a Quebec measure, but one applicable
to all the provinces that desire to take
advantage of it. The situation respecting universities in the province of Quebec is different
from that in Saskatchewan, where our only
university is already taken care of by the
State. And I think ýI am safe in saying that
ninety per cent of our hospitals are provided
for, and have not been obliged to rely upon
public char.ity or private contributions. If
we should have sweepstakes in Saskatchewan,
for what should we use the proceeds? It is
all very well to say that this Bill is bad and
must therefore be kept within certain bounds
which would suit one particular province,
but we must have a wider outlook than that.
This questionr must be considered from the
standpoint of all the provinces. If sweepstakes are good for this country, if we are
to have them, we must frame the Bill to suit
conditions existing throughout the Dominion.
There are in this clause one or two other
features that at present I am inclined not to
faveur. However, I have net examined the
matter as closely as I should like to do, and

135

MARCH 8, 1934
it seems to me we should be given a littie

more time to consider the whole situation.
We can diseuss it much better outside the
Flouse. The clause we are now on is the
crux of the Bill, and if is very important that
we should flot be rushed in dealing with it.
We should have ample opportunity for considering what the purposes of the sweepstakes are to be, and for what purposes the
funds are to be used. If we had more time
to consider the exact word.ing of the clause
we should be in a better position to draft
any amcndment that miglit be thought
necessary.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Honourable mcmbers, the Bill we are now considering lias been
before tlic Senate on flirce occasions, th-at is,
twice before the present session, and it has
always been known as an Act with respect
to Hospital Sweepstakes. I have understood
that we werc in favour of sweepstakes as a
means of raîsing funds t0 assist hospitals,
and possibly other charitable objects, and I
think if wc try to go further in this we shall
be getting away from the principle of the
Bill to whicli we gave second reading. I should
not like to maintain that t0 spcnd money on
education woul be to spend it on charitable
purposes. Therefore I think we should not be
justified in amending the Bill along the line
suggesfed.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Honourable members, in those provinces whcre public hospitals
are supported by moncys raised through
taxation, it would be, I thînk, a mistake to
infroduce sweepstakes or anything else that
would tend f0 take away from the people their
sense of responsibility for the maintenance of
those institutions. 0f course, it may be said
that if receipts froma sweepstakes pay for the
support of 'hospitals, the sources from which
revenue was formerly derived for that purpose
would become availalile for other charitable
objects. In the province froma which I corne,
the maintenance of public hospitals through
taxation lias been made possible hy our
sacrifice of other public services, such as old
age pensions, which we have neyer felt we
could afford, mothers' allowances, and so on.
We believe fbat the hospîf ais are more important than these. I should be sorry t0
see this Bill passed if it were t0 result in the
Government's receiving a large su-m of money
which could be used only for the support of
hospitals. As to the amendment of the lionourable gentleman from MontarvilIe (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), fliat, the distribution of sweepstake
receipts be extended to include u.niversities, I
may say that the university in my province,

supported as it is by grants and votes of the
Legislature, i.s getting along very well. I do
not say that it lias by any means ail the money
if wants, for universities can a'lways use more
money. I feel that flic amendment sliould be
widencd to authorize flic provincial goverfimente to spend the receipts from sweepstakes,
not on liospitals alone, but on such charitable
purposes as t0 them may seem best.
Hon. Mr. CAiLDER: I move that the Committec rîse, report progress, and. ask leave
to sit again.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That motion
has alrcady been made by the honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae).
Honourable members, before the Committee
riscs, as I suppose it will, may I ask if it is not
clear now what a lot of trouble this Bill is
going to cause?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not at ai].
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Someone intimatcd that the provincial governments woul
be at the mercy of many applicants, if the
Bill were passed. Why, we are licaring from
Somne new applicants already, before the Bull
lias Jeft our hands.
,Hon. Mr. CALDER: The provi-ncial governmente arc at the mercy of many applicants
now.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHA.M: There will be
more and more apphicants. I shaîl take advantage of this opportunity to refer to one in
particular. In ail the larger and in some of the
smal'ler cities there is an organization known
as flic Fedcrated Charities. That is, the
various charitable bodies co-operate in a joint
appeal to the public, the funds eohlected being
divided among tliem on a prcarrangcd basis.
I would ask lionourable members f0 consider
the probable effeet of the Bill in discouraging
tliose who now contrihbute so li'beralily t0 flie
appeals made on behaîf of the Federated
Cliarities.
Progress was rcported.

CANADIAN

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
FIRST READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIHEN introduced
Bill F, an Act to amend the Canadian and

He said: This is the companion Bill to that

THE WORK OF THE SENATE
INQUIRY

DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
1, consideration of the question proposed by
Hon. Mr. Murphy:
To call the attenttion of the Goovernment to
the woik of the Sonate aid to the efforts miade
byl the Scnate to secure the initiation in this
louse of Governient mueasures, and to inquire
if it is the intention of the Governiient to
un tino dîce in the Senate at an early date any
of the legislation indicated in the Speech fron
the Thirone.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
inembers, I must congratulate the honourable
senator from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy) on
his very interesting presentation of the facts
with respect to the work of the Senate. Those
facts related to two questions: the initiation
of a greater number of Government measures
in this House, and a review of what it has
accomplished for the benefit of the country
since Confederation. I intend to deal solecly
with the first question.
The honourable gentleman has admirably
shown what has been the standing complaint
of the Senate since its inception,-that for a
considerable period in the early part of every
session no legislation comes to us from the
other House, but in the few weeks before
prorogation we are well nigh overwhelmed
with work.
I entered this Chamber in 1898. There
still sat here a number of senators who had
been appointed by royal proclamation in 1867.
They were outstanding men and had been
active in public life for nearly half a century.
I had almost reached my thirty-sixth ycar, and
I regarded those honourable gentlemen with
Right

MEIGHEN

awe and reverence. I noticed that on the
first Friday vwe adjourned over the week-end.
This continued for weeks and weeks. Our
Order Paper was merely a blank sheet. But
perhaps we bencfited by listening to a longer
prayer than the one we hear to-day from the
lips of His Honour the Speaker. The Senate
had been organized on the same pattern as
the House of Lords. Some honourable members may net know that in those days an
Anglican Bisiop in full canonical robes would
kneel at the table and pray with us-and
for us-for fifteen or twenty minutes. Then
wc would adjourn until next day. A number
of senators from the extreme East and the
extreme West used to arrange for accommodation in this city for the period of the
session, and then for four or five months
they enjoyed congregating here from day to
day te participate in the prayers. When His
Lordship died the various denominations asked
to be given official recognition in this service.
They became so insistent that the Prime
Minister of the day decided that what was
good enough for the House of Commons
sh1l.d be good enough for the Senatc, and te
suggested that His Honour the Speaker
should perform the duties of claplain.
ni months we are
that f1' wek
tit
Why is
wittout work? I direct the attention of my
honourable colleagues to thse facts, and I
am drawing on thirty-six years' experience.
The debate on the Address, as hionourable
senators are aware, gives members of the
other House full scope to speak on everything contained in the Speech from the
Throne and on everytiing outside the Spe eth.
We know aIso that the deba.te on the Budget
covers an equally broad field; and that the
voting of supply is sometimes long drawn
out. These three fine morsels, which require
very nearly three months in the other House,
are disposed of by us in a few days. Usually
our dehate on the Address lasts only a few
hours, but sometimes it is adjourned to the
next sitting and concluded thn. The Budget,
in the form of a Supply Bill, comes to us in
the last hour, sometimes even in the last ten
minutes, of the session. I often suggested to
my Cabinet colleagues that they shoul.d give
the Senate an opportunity te discuss the Supply Bill for at least an hour before the time
set for prorogation. I represented to them
that it was undignified for the Senate to be
given such a short space of time in which to
ronsider the Bill. But we must net forget
that the debates on the Address and on the
Budget and the voting of supply are, one
might say, peculiarly the business of the
House of Commons. In the debate on the

MARCH 8,1934
Address ail the affairs of the country may be
reviewed; the debate on tbe Budget relates
particularly to financial and economic questions; and the voting of suppiy necessarily involves iengtby discussion. So it is not surprising that the House of Commons bas to
give two or three months' consideration te
these three maj or subi ects, which. we dispose
of in less tban forty-eight hours.
When 1 became a member of this Chamiber
I met Sir James .Lougheed, wbo was not very
much my senior. We decided that we migbt
just as weii pray at home, and we began to
move the adjournment of tbe House for a
weck, and then for two wceks. I remember
that in the session of 1903 1 moved that the
House adjouin for a month. At once Sir
Mackenzie Bowell and the Hon. Mr. Scott
jumped up in protest. They wcre scandaiized
that such a long adjou.rnment shouid be suggested. Sir James waiked over to me and
said, "We had hetter postpone this motion
until to-morrow." But whilc we were convcrsing the Speaker put the question, and the
motion was carried. Thereupon Mr. Scott
declared in solemn tones: "Nevermore wil
I meddlc with a motion for adjourament. In
future the Senate may do as it pleases."
Duriiig the course of that session he made
several motions £or adjournments of two or
tbree weeks. On one of those occasions Il
couid nlot restrain the impulse to remind
him of what he liad solemnly declared when
I bad made a similar motion.
Why bas it been the custom of the Senate
to adjourn for two or three weeks at a time?
Because the House of Commons does not
take up its legisiative programme until its
vitality bas been weakened by those three
important debates. Now, if asked wby of a
five-montb session there remain only two
montbs for legisiation, I would point out to
my colleagues tbat the legisiation in the
other House is in the bands of 245 members,
as compared witb 96 members in tbis Chamber. Further, discussion on the bis is much
longer in the other House because there the
political and electoral factor is aiways present.
At times--after haif a dozen bis had reacbed
the Senate-my colleagues in the Cabinet
would ask me where we stood in the matter
of legislation, and I would answer, "We have
nothing before us?" "Nothing hefore you!
Why, we have already sent you half a dozen
bis." -I would reply, "Yes, but whcreas in
discussing those his in the House of Gommons you for the most part address ycourseives
to the electors, we address ourselves to the
question, and it is a much shorter procedure."

à

Since 1867 it has been a standing grievance
of tbe Senate that we are idle for months
and then overwhelmed with legisiation. I
recognize that a laudable effort has been made
by my right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) to alter this unsatisfactory condition, and that to a certain degree he has
succeeded. It may be -àrged that since there
bas been no substantial improvement there
is no cure. But I gubmit there is a very
simple cure, and it is to be found in the
proposai introduced by my honourable friend
from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy)-the desirability at the beginning of the session of
ioitiating more measures in this Huse. Wby
bas it not been donc? Because we have
seldom biad more than two ministers with
portfolios sitting in the Sonate, and usually
only one minister. When I entered this
Chamber, in 1898, the then Minister of Justice,
Hon. Mr. Milis, and the Secretary of State,
Hon. Mr. Scott, were the only members of
the Government with seats in the Senate.
The measures emanating fromn their departments were introduced here because of their
presence in this Chamber, but the legislation
of the other twelve or f ourteen departmnents,
wbose ministers were in the House of -Comnmons, went to that bouse. It is quite
natural and proper that a minister should
want to father bis own bis. He feels that
it is bis right to hring bis own cbild, as .it
were, to the baptismal font.
I admit that certain measures, lîke money
bisE, should be presented in the House of
Gommons. Then there are others wbicb I
should not very much care to sec introduced
in thisChamber-bils involving differences of
opinion between the two parties, or of such
a character as to give risc to argument for
presentation to the electors. Such measures,
after we had disposed of them quietly, would
be sent to the Commons and there taken up
in a quite different spirit. For that reason,
even though they did not involve the expenditurc of money, I shou]d besitate to suggest
that they originate in tbis Chamber. 1 think
it is preferable that bis of that kind sbould
go first to the arena of the Commons, where
the members înterested may cross swords.
The difficulty whicb arises from tbe desire
of ministers to handie their own legisiation
could very easily be overcome by having them
present their legisiation in this Chamber. I
have suggested this procedure on more than
one occasion ini the Senate, and as I do not
think my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Murphy) bas placed on record the notice of
motion that I gave on the 22nd of June, 1922,
I wiil read it. It is as f oilows:

138

SENATE

That Le will move to make the following a
rle of the Senate as rule 18A, and that the
senators in attendance on the session be
summonef to consider the sanie, nanely:
18A. When a Bill or other matter relating
to any subjects administered by a department
of the Government of Canada is being considered by the Senate or in Conmîittee of the
Whole, the minis-ter administering the department may with the aseent of the Senate enter
the Senate Chiamber, and, subject to the rules,
orders, forcis of proceedings, and usages of the
Senate, mîay for the furtherance of legislation
relating to the Bill or inatter in îuestion take
part in the debate.

I added-and I apologize for reading my
own remarks-the following comment:
We have all noticed during our experience,
whether long or short, in this Chiamber, that
the inisters having the administration of the
departients have generally felt that it was
their duty to introduce legislation concerning
their departiments thenselves. The consequence
lias been that they have generally introduced
their legislation in the Chanmber in which they
had a seat; and as, since Confederation, they
have mostly been in the House of Commons, the
legislation lias been initiated in that Chamber.
If they were allowed to initiate their legislation in the Senate, I am quite sure that we
would not have to face the condition which we
are facing to-day, and which we face every
session, of having nearly all of the public Bills,
and legislation concerning matters of considerable importance, brought before ns in the last
days of the session. If the rule were amended,
it seems to nie that they would take advantage
of the opportunity to corne here to further
their legislation while the Commons were
engaged in some other discussion. Generally
there are long discussions on the Address;
supply has to be voted, and the Budget speeches
occupy the attention of that House for several
weeks, while we in this House, a body of 96
menbers, are waiting for the Government legislation to be reacled in this Chamber.
J suggested this method some ten years ago;
the riglît honourable the junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
suggested it last week; and I will submit it to
the judgment of the Senate on Monday next at
the second sitting.
It was on a Thursday that I brought this
matter to the attention of the House. The
session was then drawing rapidly to a close,

not because we liad not important work to
do here, but because the Commons were concluding their labours. I bad in hand at that
time perhaps a dozen important bills. Honourable members who are sufficiently interested
may look up the recordý. This notice was
placed on the Order Paper for the Monday.
As we met on the Saturday, I spent Saturday
evening and the whole of Sunday trying to
understand and digest certain clauses of a
Bill relating to customs or excise, of which,
I must confess, I could make neither head nor
tail. Suddenly I remembered that this motion
was set down for the next day; so I took up

bill and explain it. To my surprise I met with
a chilly response. He, it seems, had hiad quite
enough to do in piloting the Bill through the
Commons. I then said, "At all events, you will
come and explain it to me," whereupon he
directed me to a certain official. After working with this official for an hour or more on
this involved picre of legislation, which I iad
understood to come from the Customs Department, but which the officials of that department claimed had come from the Department
of Finance, I walked into the Senate the next

worries of the previous forty-eight hours were
groundless, for no -objection was raised to
the Bill, and it passed. I may say, however,
that objection was raised to it in all parts of
the country when it carne into effect. Boards
of Trade from East to West met and
demanded some explanation. I then began to
understand why Mr. Fielding had refused to
come to the Senate to discuss the Bill.
When the Monday arrived, I felt somewhat
discouraged at the lack of entbusiasm on the
part of my colleagues for the proposal that
they should come here and for the second time
present their legislation in Parliament. I met
also with some objections, which are reflected
in an amendment that I proposed to make to
the motion. I hiad not absolutely decided to
drop my motion, but I suggested amending it.
I said:
As I inderstand that some honourable menhers would like to discuss this motion for a
revision of our rules at some length, I will
ask that it be postponed until the second
sitting tu-morrow; but I will indicate a small
aniendment in the notice so that it niay be
incorporated with the proposed rule. I desire
to insert before the word "enter" the following words:
"On the initiative of the Minister representing the Government."
The purpose of that was to meet the
objection which lad been raised, that if we
altered our rules the Senate miglt henceforth
insist on ministers being present to explain
their legislation, and I was told that under
certain conditions members of the Cabinet
in the other House would prefer to have the
leader of the Government in the Senate
handle their bills for them.
The majority at that time was sitting on
this side of the House, and one of my
colleagues somewhat facetiously voiced his
objection in these words: "Go and present my

-MARCU 8, 193419
measure to the Senate? Why, if I did that,
chances are nine out of ten that it wouid
neyer reach the Commons." He preferred to
remain on bis own ground. I used to remark
that it was far casier for a Minister of the
Crown to get bis legisiation tbrougb the
buse of Commons, where he had a soiid
tuaiority bebind him, than it was to get it
tbrougb the Senate; and sometimes I requested more thorough explanations than had
been given in tbe Commons, because I had to
convince a majority sitting opposite to me.
I have aiso met some Commoners wbo have
said: "Aliow our ministers to go to the
Senate? Wby, if we did that the prestige of
the bouse of Commons wouid be Iessened
and the influence of the Upper Chamber increased. We prefer to retain ail the benefits
that flow from the initiation of legisiation, in
the Commons."
The inieriority of our position in regard to
pubiicity is due to the fact that most of the
measures that interest the public are introduced in the other Chamber, and by the time
the discussions in that bouse are compieted,
and the iast argument is presented, the lemon
bas been squeezed dry, to use a colloquial
exp'reasion. After two bundred and fortyfive meinhers in the other bouse have spent
weeks in discussing a subi ect pro and con, it
is difficuit to present new arguments on it,
and before the question reachee the Senate the
public, througb reading the newspapers, have
been surfeited with it.
On the last day of the 1922 session, at the
suggestion of Sir James Lougheed, I decided to
postpone the motion standing in my Dame.
Aithough I did not attempt to revive it at a
later session, I wonder wbether it would not
be opportune-and I leave it to the discretion
of my rigbt honourable friend-to amend our
rule so that ministers of the Crown in the
other bouse couid, if so inciined, come into
the Chamber. Deputy ministers are permitted to come to the floor of the Senate.
Why sbouId not ministers sit with us and
take part in the discussion regarding legisiation emanating from their departments? I
can recail a number of occasions during the
last five or ten years when ministers have
attended meetings of Senate committees in
order to discuss measures in which they were
interested.
There is one aspect of this matter which my
honourabie friend (bon. Mr. Murphy) did
not touch upon, simpiy because he iimited
himseif to the historicai point of view. I
refer to the fact that the Senate is considered to be a revising body and as such
bas piayed its part since its inception. The
initiation of bis in this Chamber wouid

change that situation and make the House
of Commons the revising hody. Furthermore,
arguments have been advanced against the
absndonment hy the Senate of the position
of a court of appeal in regard to legisiation
coming fromn the Commons. As a matter of
fact, to judge from the stàtements made hy
the Fathers of Confederation, and by Sir John
Macdonald prior to Confederation, and cited
by my bonourable friend fromn Russell (Hon.
Mr. Murphy), we have heen appointed mainly
for the purpose of givîng sober second thought
to proposed legislation, and, of course, if we
originated legisiation and passed it on to the
House of Commons for approval, we should
Dlot be fulfilling that function.
It scems to me, however, that private legislation might very well be divided equally
between the two Chambers. Many members
of this buse, more especially those who have
entered it recently, do flot know just how it
is that private bis are mnitiated sometimes
in this Chamber and sometimes in the Commons. It ail depends on the solicitor in
charge of the Bill, who sends his petitions to
the three branches of Parliament. If he sends
bis cheque to the Clerk of the Senate the
legisIation is initiated here; if he sends it to
the Clerk of the buse of Commons the Bill
belongs to, that buse. Apparently money
talks. I have suggested many times that an
officiai sbouid be appointed to receive petitions for private legisiation and distribute
them equaliy between the two bouses of Parliament. This, of course, wouid not appiy to
divorce bis. He would not ailow the House
of Commons to touch tbem.
bon. Mr. TANNER: How would it do to
offer a bonus for bis, or something like
that?
býon. Mr. DANDURAND: I must apologize to the buse for the Iength of my remarks. I intended sîmpIy to state my reaction to the situation as I have observed it
from year to year since 1898.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Hlonourabie members, I do not think I have had
the pleasure, either in the other House or
tbis one, of iistening to a more succinct or
more cogent speech than that of the honourable senator from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy).
It was an example of coinprehensiveness and
brevity, and was couched in language which
would have done credit to the judgment of
any court.
This is the lirst occasion on which a
motion of this character bas come before
the Upper bouse during my membership,
and it bas come at a time when pressure
of duties, chiefly committee work, bas made

saying this by way of complaint at all-he
virtual]y has to do as much work as ahl the
other members of the Government. I remernber that in the debate of 1921 in the other
Chamber the then member for Halifax, who
is now President of the Exchcqucr Court of
Canada, drcw attention te this fact and
strongly emphasized that, much as hce would
like to sec an increase in the volume of legislation introduccd in the Upper Hous, there
could be no increase so long as the principal
duties in the way of sponsoring legislatien
there devolved upon a single memiber; and
in fact, hie said, the volume should be decrcased in those cîrcumstanccs. It secmst
me that an increase in the num-ber of Cabinet
ministers in the Senate is a prerequisite to
an expansion in the volume of govcrnmental
legislation introduced here.
It is the regponsibility of the leader of the
Governmcnt in this Chamber to familiarîze
himself with ail govcrnmcntal legislation,
rcgardlcss of whcther it originates here or in
another place, to the extent of bcing able to
dcfend it when it cornes 'before us for consideration. But his duties with respect to any
measure which hie introduces arc very much
greater. He may have considerable work to do
in amcnding it, pcrhaps in recasting it entircly.
He has to attend meetings of the cornmittee
which considers it and, if necessary, hears
witncsses. He has to spend hours upon it;
in some instances very many hours and days
and wceks. It is certainly not a matter for
regret, but on the contrary should be one for
pride, that this is so, for, whatcver may be
possible elsewhere, the fact is that in the
Senate hie will neyer succeed in getting bis
legislation pased until hie does make himsîf
thoroughly -conversant with it. At the present
time the cornrittcc work, as ail honourable
meiemhers know, is undoubtedly the rnost
useful work that the Senate docs.
New, I fear that this prerequisite of more
Cabinet ministers with seats in the Upper
House is, one which we are not likcly to
attain. It is one of the characteristies of
dernocracy that the more it has the more it
wants; and in the mind of the public the
cure for any ills of dernocracy is always more
dcrnocraey. No amount of argument, ne
amnount of example, no array of disaster exhibited frern other countries, will ever change
that situation. It may be because of this
that the pathway of dcmocracy bas been
rather rocky, perilous and full of catastrophes
in late years. Dem'ocracy bas been dethroned
in the greater part of the Occidental world,
and to-day there are only two dernocratic
governments left ini the whole continent of
Europe. But these reflections do flot carry

141

us very far. We are a long way fromn the
failure of democracy in Anglo-Saxon lands.
It will be a long time before there is any
serious thought of a change of systemi in
Canada, or in any other British or AngloSaxon country. Consequcntly we may as
well resign ourselves to the conviction that
the House which the people elect, which they
look upon as peculiarly their own, and as
rcflccting their ideas, is the House which wilI
contain the ministers of the Crown. The
Government of which I had the honour to
be the head for a brief period-with cmphasis
on the adjective-had three representatives
in this Chamber. During that tirne we
labourcd under continuous attacks in the
other Hous on the ground that we had far
tLoo many ministers in the Senate, where they
werc free frorn public criticism and could
not he made to answer to the representatives
of the people. It seemed to be an almost
universal belief that if a departmnent had any
rnoney to spend, the head of that dcpartrnent
had no business whatever to be in the Upper
Hous. For myseif 1 should despair of the
success of any move to have more ministers
sitting here. It is altogether unlikely that
we should be able to, bring that about, and
therefore there is a distinct lirait to the
volume of governmcntal legislation which can
with advantage be initiated and sponsored in
the Senate.
However, within that limit much is possible.
This -session flve goveimmental bis, 'I think,
have already been introduced in this Chamber.
They have to go to our committees. for the
main review which they will get before they
pass out of our hands. I do not think the
proportion of governmental ilegisiation which.
may advantageously be introduced in the
Senate can be enlarged, much over the proportion initia-ted here in the last two sessions
and that which we are to have in the present
session. But there is an area, in which 1 think
considerable advance might be made, and that
is the area of private bis. By virtue of the
rules of the Senate, as 1 apprehend-but it
rnay be merely by virtue of custom-divorce
bis are peculiarly measures which must be
taken up in this Chamber -frst. I sec no
serious objection to placing ail prîvate bis in
the sarne category in this respect, and 1 arn at
a loss te know why this should not be done.
It may be argued that honourable members
of the other Hous sheuld flot be dcbarred
from the privilege of întroducing and expounding there measures; in which their constituents may 'be specially interested, and that
sucl bills should not first -have to run the
gauntiet of thec Senate. There is some force te
that objection. 0f course it would apply to

142

SENATE

divorce bis as wvell, thoulgh I suppose no
membr is very eger to have the honour or
credit of intreducing those mneasures. But the
objection is one which could readily be surmoianted. For instance, it miglit be arranged
that any member of the other House should
have the priviiege of introducing any private
bill he wishes. that hie or any other member
should have the right to speak uLpon it on the
first reading. and that it shouid then ho sent
over to this, Chamber, where a-Il three readings
would be given before it is returned to the
Commons for further consideration.
This
would work to the advantage of the generai
system, because a great number of private buis
are usuaily introduced in the carly part of the
session. Thus they would arrive here before
the big harvest from the other House reachies
us, and mair time would be occupied in perforrning a service of real value-a service
which I think, with ali due deference and
respect, the members of this body, on account
of their comparative freedom, their abiiity to
give those bis unfettered consideration, are
more capable of performing than are the
members of the other Chamber. If this shou'ld
be brought about-and I see no reasen wby it
should not-the balance would be restored to
a con.iderable degree, though flot wboily. At
aiýl events, some worthwhiie progress would hie
made towards divîding more fairly and more
happily for ail concerned the responsibilities
of the two Bouses of Parliament.
Another proposai has heen uoder discussion
on severai occasions. It was expoundod quite
abiy in the speech of the honourable member
from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy), and again,
in stili greater detail, by the honourabie
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). It is the establishment of a practice,
properly introduced and sauctioned, whereby
any reinister from either Chamber wouid be.
permitted-and indeed obiiged, if invited or
requested-to go to the other Chamber for
the purpose of explaining any measure which
hie may be sponsoring. In speaking on this in
1921, as honourabie members know from a
reforence made by the honourabie senator
from Russell, 1 rather weicorned the idea and
saw no serious dificuity in the way. The subject was then discussed upon a motion by the
honourabie gentleman who is uow the senater
from Rougernont (Hon. Mir. Lernieux). After
two or three addresses hoe was supported, in
part, by the honourabie member from Halifax
te whom I have previousiy aliuded. That
honourable gentleman, however, restricted bais
support to ministers sitting in one bouse being
privileged to enter the other; hie was not
prepared tu hav e the arrangýement made reciprecel. I do net recali which Huse was the

Commons being pormittcd te address this
Chamber in support of measures ernanatingfrom their respective departrnents; and, conversely, te ministors frern this House being
for a sinjilar reason perrnitted te enter the
e iber Chamber.
As the honourabie senator
opposite me (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) lias vert'
cieariy shewn, the ruies couid ho se amendod
as te invite ministers, and reaily make
it their duty te corne when invited, toecxpoiînd thoir measures. Thieir riglht te de se
should net be restricted in any way except
by motion, duly carriod, in the Chamber te
which tiîey went. 0f course, the power of
each Chamber te centrol its own proceedings
muîst remain slIprPrnP; therefore the attendance of a minister must necessariiy ho subjeet te such rules as the Chamber mighit
prescriho te govern his presence sud bis righlts
while ho was within its bounds. Very littie
mechauism is necessary fer this purpese.
I
fancy it could be done by joint resolution. I
have ne doubt it ceuld ho done by amendment
of the ruies of the twe flouses. It is assurned
that such visiting ministers, if wo may se
denominate them, weuld have ne right te
vote; we could net give them the righit censtitutionaliy; 'but the right te speak and te
explain is very distinct frern the right te vote,
and I de net tiîink there can ho sny question
as te our censtitutieusi powers in respect of
this limited right.
This brings nie te a relevant consideration.
It seems te me that if sucli right were extendcd te ministers of the Crown, it ought te
ho and could very happily be extended te the
sponsors of private bis in either Huse. An
honourable member of the Cemmons introduces a private bill and if is given first reading. The bill thon cernes te this Chamber for
main consideration. The privato member who
bas sponsored the bill should, I think, have
the right te corne te this Chamber and, keeping at ail tirnes within the rules which. we
erect, seek by argument te get bis bill passed.
I do net sce hew we could extend the right
te ministers ef the Crown without extending
an analogeus right te a private member in
relation te a bill which hoe sponsors. Simiiarly,
a member of this Huse who introduces a
private rneasure eught te have the right te
go te the other Bouse and take bis part in
seeiug- that it is givea the fullest and fairest
consideration at the bands of that Chamber.
This, if seoms te me, lends sorne support
te the suggestiun of the hunourabie ,u.îîator
from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy) and the

TO HIS

OF

MEMORY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I beg leave to, make reference to the death in England of a former
Governor General of our country, the Marquis
of Aberdeen and Tesnair. Mention of the
name of this distinguished man carrnes the

1-

6,424,000 00
2,799,997 73

8,614,000 00

mmnd back to a time beyond the experience in
public life of by far the greater number of
members of this Chamber. From. 1893, over
forty years ago, until 1M9, lie ooctapied the
exalted post of representative of the Crown
in this Dominion. This was not the first of
his distxinguished services under the Crown,
for in the previous decade he lied performed
the duties of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It
is a tribute to his practical success in both

74728-10
RMVIED EDMON

146

SENATE

offices that in the middle of the first decade of
this century he was reappointed to bis former
position in Ireland, in which country ho is
remembered for bis faithful and efficient discharge of onerous and no doubt troublesome
functions over a period of ten ycars. He has
also been known. more particularly in later
times, as one of the foremost officers and
toilers in the service of the Church in Great
Britain, he having been High Commissioner
of the Church of Scotland.
Most of us recall the time when Lord Aberdeen was Governor General, even though we
were not then in public life. We know of the
acceptability and the strict regard for constitutional usages with which ho discharged
the duties of bis office. We know also of bis
kindly and genial nature, and of the high
respect in which he and bis distinguished consort were held by the people of Canada. To
have survived for so long a time after having
reached a post of such great responsibility
is in itself a record rarely achieved.
When we think of his performance of bis
duties bere, the episode that comes first to
mind is perhaps that occasion when, not for
the purpose of thwarting the will of Parliament, still less the will of the people, he
decided that ho should not accept the advice
of the Government of the day, but should
rather give opportunity later for the expression of what seemed to bo the real will of
Parliament. The propriety of bis decision is
best attested by the fact that never since, so
far as I know, bas any Government ventured
to give advice of the character of that then
refused. I may be forgiven if at the moment
I express regret that the principle upon which
ho acted-that the will of the people, as represented by Parliament, should prevail, even
though it entailed the turning back of advice
given immediately by the Government of the
day-has not at a later date been acknowledged as the soundest by some eminent public
men in Canada.
It is indeed a va'lued privilege to join in
expressing on behalf of the Senate of Canada
our respect for the late Marquis of Aberdeen,
our gratitude for the services which ho rendered, and the honour which we accord te bis
name.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it was my privilege to come into
fairly close contact with the late Marquis of
Aberdeen, who was appointed Governor Genoral in 1893 and remained in office until the
autumn of 1898. Two years prior to bis
appointment I crossed the ocean with him,
and I thon learned of the importance which
lie and Lady Aberdeen attached to the office
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

of the King's representative in this Dominion.
Having been apprised that he would be
offered the appointment as successor to the
then incumbent of that office, Lord Aberdeen
came to Canada, accompanied by bis wife,
about two years before the office became
vacant, in order that they might familiarize
themselves with the people and conditions in
this country. They went to Hamilton, Ontario,
where they lived for a year in a fine mansion
that had been the home of the late Senator
Turner, and they did considerable travelling
in that time.
During the five years they were officially in
Canada, Lord and Lady Aberdeen led very
active lives. As other occupants of Rideau
Hall have been wont to do, they went from
the Atlantic to the Pacifie, visiting many
places and meeting the people. They devotod
themselves whole-heartedly to philanthropie
and social work, in which field, although Lady
Aberdeen seemed to be the more active, she
was always assisted by her husband. She
founded the Canadian Council of Women, in
order to bring together representatives of all
the social and charitable associations throughout the land for the exchange of views and
mutual help. Some years later she founded
the International Council of Women to coordinate the work of the national councils
which she had been instrumental in persuading
various countries of the world to establish.
I remember meeting her at the international
gathering in Paris in 1900, when the representatives of Canada played no insignificant
role. The Marquis and bis wife founded the
Victorian Order of Nurses. The Order bas
extended throughout the Dominion, and in
my part of the country is doing magnificent
work. They also founded the Aberdeen Association for the distribution of books to newcomers in the West who were without contact with any kind of library. Thousands of
books, newspapers and reviews have been sent
to these immigrants by the Association. I
had the pleasure of attending some of the
meetings of these associations held here and
at Montreal, and I observed that the Governor
General and Lady Aberdeen gave their whole
soul to the development of the work in which
those organizations were engaged.
As my right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) bas said, Lord Aberdeen on bis
return to England was appointed Viceroy of
Ireland. For years ho and his gifted wife
devoted their lives to the welfare of the Irish
people.
Among other good works they
founded a clinie for the treatment of tuberculosis, and I understand it is still doing good
work.
In many ways they showed their

MARCH 13, 1934
heartfelt solicitude for the people whom they
were governing, so to speak-for we know
that in Canada and ber sister dominions the
Governor General for the time being does
flot govern, and should rather be called Viceroy, inasmuch as he represents exclusively the
Crown.
I remember having conversations with Lord
Aberdeen in which he would repeatedly tell
me that ever sinoe an ancestor of bis accompanied William the Conqueror to England
his family had maintained some relation with
For instance, he
their ancestral lineage.
claimed that his name Gordon perpetuated
that of Gourdon, a Norman ancestor. He
gloried in the historie association of Scotland
with France, and in claiming affiliation with
the French of tbis country he frequently ref erred to the ancient history in whicb his
ancestors bore so prominent a part.
I join with my right honourable friend in
expressing my sympatby and that of my colleagues wbo sit around me with Lady Aberdeen-a gracious lady who gave so many
years of her 11f e to promote the welfare of
the Canadian people.

Hon. J. D. TiAYLOR rose in accordance
witb tbe foliowing notice:
That lie will eall attention to the adminietration of Canadian sealing and fishery
interests in Pacific waters; and will move
that a speci-al committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into the results of exiting
treaties in this connection; with power to cali

.He said: Honourable senators, I feel happy
in having selected a subjeet wh.ich, while
not in any sense controversial, will, I think,
be very interesting to every member of tbis

Four years ago, in connection with the conventions respecting the halibut and sockeye

would be more satisfactory ta refer tbem to
a committee of the Senate in ordes, that
information m.igbt be gathered which otherwise was not available on the floor of the
House 'wben appropriate legislation was being
discussed. I was reminded, and quite properly
so, by the honourable gentleman opposite

Dandurand) that these conventions were suhmitted to us simply for our approval or

Up to deal with flshery matters lie would be
very bappy to co-operate. 1 remind tbe
honourable gentleman of tbe incident, and bis
sincerity of purpose justifies me in expecting
bis belp upon tbîs occasion.
At that time I erpressed rny regret that
such an important department as tbe fisheries
should be treated as an orphan, and urged
that a Minister of Fisheries ouglit to be
appointed. Later on tbe Government of that
day placed in the estimates an item for the
setting up of a separate department, and
the present Government f ollowed its good
example by appoin-ting as the first Minister
one of the ibrigbtest and, in the business
sense particularly, one of the wisest of tbe
public men of Canada. It is, I am sure, a
matter of regret to those interested in our
fisheries tbat the honourable gentleman was
so soofi transferred to, the even more important Department of Finance. While we cannot criticize this action, I am certain tbat all
those interested in our fisheries hope tbat the
Government will soon find a wortby successor
to the first Minister to bold the portfolio.
The three matters covered by my motion
are of primary interest to British Columbia
and have become so ripe for discussion and
consideration that tbis is a most opportune
time to bring them to tbe notice of bonourable gentlemen.
First in importance comes pelagie sealing.
I remember very well wben Our sealing fleet
was the pride of the Victoria water front.
A large number of the local population then
depended on sealing for their liveliboodmen wbo bad sailed around tbe Horn in
boats which tbey themseives had built in
the shipyards of Nova Scotia, New BrunsWe in British
wick, -and Newfoundland.
Columbia were proud of that addition to our
population, and those thrifty and industrious
people on. their part were pleased to settîs
amidst surroundings so pleasant as those of
Victoria.
But very soon tbese men passed through
a very anxious period. *Many of tbeir boats
were seized and held ini Russian ports for
alleged trespassing. Then f ollowed a long
period of uneertainty while the right of our
nationals to engage in pelagsie sealing in
certain parts of the Behring Sea and tbe
North Pacifie Ocean was being discussed and
settled in tbeir favour. But this absolute
right had to be restrieted; otberwise witbin
a few years the seal herd would have been
exterminated. The prospect of discontinuance of pelagie aealing was ail the more dis-

follow~ing
immecdiately
after the sealing
s(a:on, gave the 'ýeal hinters a better chance
of m'-aking a living than when they had to
depend on scaling alone.
The Sealing Treaty was arranged, as ail
similar treaties have always been arranged,
without, any reference to this Parliament. I
was a member of the Huse of Commons
at the time and discussed the maLter with
the Prime Minister of the day, the late Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. It is matter of publie knowledg-e now that hie resisted the suggestion then
made to give up in perpetuity the right of
Canadians to engage in pelagie sealing on the
high spas., and hecausc of bis insistence a
ime limit was set upon the operation of the
treaty. Siîr Wilfrid urged that ten years
would ho sufficient to ensure the rehabilitaLion of the hierd, but eventually a Lime limit
of fifteen years was agreed upon. This pcriod
expired in 1926. Since then it has been open
to the Government of Canada to take up
withi the United States Goveroment a revision
of the 1911 treaty.
I have not the treaty before me, but 1
can outline its termas. Canada was to receive
fifteen pier cent in numiber of the sealskins taken annuallv upon the Pribilof
Island.s, the breeding ground of the seals.
Canada and the United Stattes agreed tlîat
their respective nationals should not hunt
seuls upon the higli seas, but this prohibition
was not te apply te the Indians of cither
country.
At the outset the American Government
showed a disposition to, deal quite generously
with Canada. It advanced what for those
days was a large suma of money to be paid to
the owners of the Canadian sea]ing fleet as
compensation. This was in anticipation of
our annual quota of the sealskins. But
the Government of Canada was less generous in iLýs allocation of the money, and,
greatly to the disappointmcent of some
of our sealers, onl 'v a relativeiy small proportion ivas distributed among them; the
balance remains in the trcasury. I need
say no more about this phase, for a new
generation bas arisen in Victoria which perhaps bas forgotten the incident or lias forgiven the Government responsible for withholding the money. 0f late years the officiaI
reports of the Canadian Department of
Marine and Fîsheries disclose that the
Amecrican Goiverniment does not appear to deal
so generously ii
Canada in its allocation
of seaiing money, if we are to .iudge by the
fact that the payments Le Canada for giving

up bier sealing rights; have eachi year become
less andi less, until in 1932 the American Govcrnmiient bias paid Canada only S2.600 as ourshare for the 49.000 scalskins taken. This
amounts te about five cents for eacla sealskin.
If I amn asked, "Wliat do yoii suggst, yolîr
propo 4(1 co a i i t tee sh ou Id diýcu >?" 1'
Iep ly
that at the very outset iL should ascertain
lhow our share of these 49,000 sealskins bias
been computed at onlv S2,600. If iL be sg
gested that I arn exaggerating the number of
sealskins taken in 1932, as the Canadian binebook shows a total of only 34.000, I would
oint eut that. the American returns show
49,000 odd were taken, and centain the further
information that this is just 188 more or less
-I forget whicli-than the number taken the
year before.
At the tîme of tbe treaty tbe scal herd
numbered 250,000; to-day it is 1,250,000. I
understand it is contended that under the
treaty wve bave ne interest whatever in tbe
extra million seals, and that our only recourse
is te .-et the Lreaty se revised that wve may
..hý,rp in the proceeds net on]ly of the sealskin,
taken each season, but of the natural increase
in the hierd. This alsa the proposed comimittee miglit wcll consider and report upon.
There is anothlir verv important aspect of
pelagie sealing tbat is looming larger and
larger in the minds of persons; interesteci in
the fisheries of British Columbia. There lias
been an unexplained diminution in the sockcyc saimon. This is the most important of
the Britisli Columbia fislieries. Our experts,
men wvho have given a lifetime te the study
of the habits of the salmon. and whose constant thouglit is of the welfare of that branch
of our fishermen's livelihood, have been
puzzled te know what becomes of the salmon.
For ycars they attributed the diminution
te the rock siide at Hell's Gate. That was
pure imagination.
From my knowledge of
the fisiieries of the Fraser river, after many
ycars of resiîlence in tilat vicinity, I could
net sec howv that occurrence could have been
responsible for cvcn a fraction of the results
attributed te it. But the officiai idea that
nothing cisc wvas responsible persisted for se
long that two or three ycars ago it was
actually made the basis of a proposai for
anotlier convention with the United States.
By this convention we wcre Le hand over the
salmon fisheries-in addition Le the other two
fisheries-Lto American management, se that
the Americans, who evidiently were reckoned
te bc smarter than mere Canadians, could
corne in and set up establishmnents at the
hcadwaters of the Fraser river Le breed fish,
a moiety of which were te be presented te

MARCH 13, 1934
Canada and the United States for the perpetuation of the run.
Fortunately for us, but unfortunately for
the theorists, this Parliament blocked that
convention, and the Government, who up to
that time, apparently, had not really considered its ternis, was moved to withdraw it
and substitute another convention. This new
convention has not yet been adopted by the
United States Senate. In the meantime, while
these means of accomplishing the salvation
of the salmon were being discussed between
the two governments, the sockeye salmon
came back unannounced, without any assistance fromn us or from the United States, and
in 1930 we had the biggest run and the
biggest pack of sockeye salmon in twenty
years. 'So 1 arn not surprised that 1 see no
mention of Hell's Gate when I pick up the
bluebook. That notion bas disappeared with
other myths.
If we bad this committec, possibly we could
consider, with t~he aid of the experts and the
biological staffs, the question of what bappened that caused the salmon to disappear,
and what happened that caused themn to corne
back unassisted by either Government.
While I arn associaiting the solmon with the
seals, another thought occuTs to me. We
escort the seals every year on the way from
their living groundis in the South Placific up
to, the Pribiýlof Islandis. A Canadian mine
sweeper joins the American fleet in watching
over thema as they pass rthrough the northern
waters tributary to the United States and to
the coast of Canada. Our share of the cost of
that patrol is over $10,000. I mention that
just to contrast it with the $2,600 which we
get as our share of the proceecis -of the seal
harvest which we have spent $10,000 to protect.
Harking back again to the unexplained
shortage of the sockeye sai-mon in those
waters, there is this further idea. When the
Americans took over the control of the seals
there were only 250,000, 1 think, swimming in
those waters. As the seals are carefully barvested, the herd bas increased by 50,000 -or60,000 or 70,000 every year since, andi as there
are so *many more to be fed, it seems very
Iikely that the extra seals make considerable
inroads into the salmon.
.We know very well from our experienoe Of
sea lions, which are killled every year by
parties sent out by the Government, that the
average daily food consumption of animais of
that description, is anywhere from fifteen to
twenty fuIl-grown saimon. Yet we seem
oblivious to the fact thait an additional million seals are feeding on our sockeye salmon,
and there is no one in authority in -Canada to

institute an inquiry, or push it with our friends
in the United States, as to who properly
should pay for the feeding of those seals during their progress northward. That interesting subject, I think, migbt be referred to the
committee which the honourable gentleman
opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was good
enougb to promise me the last time I discusseci
the matter with bim.
I have said that this subject, under three
heacis, is really open for determination at the
present time. As to the soals, it is opportune
because of the fact that the pe.riod for which
we made the convention ended in 1926 and
the convention is subject to the usual notice
on the part of either GoveTnrnent at any
time.
We corne next to the halibut, wbich is the
subject of a convention made in 1924. This
question is ripe for discussion because of the
nature of Canada's representation on the
Halibut Commission as contrasted with the
representation of the United States. The
Halibut Commission consists of four comrnssioners, two appointéd hy each Goverument. They direct the operations of a large
number of men of scientiflo knowledge and
high attainment.
The United States have appointed as their
commissioners, first, a Mr. O'.Malley, bead of
the Fisheries Service for the whole of the
Unitedi States, and one of the brightest minds
in the whole American service. He is an outstanding man in every association of bis life.
Mr. O'Malley is a frequent visitor to the hallbut groundis to the nortb. Next they bave
-or had, for I think he bas been replaced,
although of that I arn not sure-Mr, Miller
Freeman, of Seattle, a publisher, a recognized
authority on fisheries publications in the
United States. H1e bas for a lifetirne followed
fishery lore, and is supposed to, be one of the
men best qualified to give advice, as weil as
information, on matters connected with fieries. That is the American -representation
-two of the livest mincis in the country,
working in close association with the biological experts who carry on their labours îat the
University of Washington, in Seattle, wbere
Mr. Miller resides.
On the Canadian side whom have we? We
have Mr. Babcock, of Victoria, Commissioner
of the Fisheries Service of British Columbia.
That service inaugurated the attempt to study
and follow up balibut lore; so it was but
natural that its commissioner, Mr. Babcock,
shoulci be assocîated with the Halibut Commission. But upon assuming this responsihility Mr. Babcock was not relieved of any of
bis other duties. He continueci to be the
heaci, in fact almost the whole staff, of the

150

SENATE

Provincial Fisheries Service, and as such he
is tied down to his desk in Victoria administering detail. He bas so little opportunity to do
anything else that he as been paid off for
services to the commission with a nominal

honorarium of

S1,000 a year. He is in no

sense the servant of this Government or
this Parliament.
Nevertbeless, from the
beginning, he bas been our senior representative. Our junior representative bas
been Mr. Found, the present Deputy Minister
of Fisheries, perhaps the busiest civil servant
in Ottawa. One would wonder how a man
with his multifarious daily duties concerning
the details of fisheries from British Columbia
to Prince Edward Island could possibly be
of assistance in a problem wholly located on
the far north Pacifie coast, where even those
who live in the southern coastal cities have
very little connection with it. J say that by
reason of their multifarious duties these two
gentlemen are unfitted to render the service
that we are entitled to ask from our representatives on the Halibut Fisheries Commission.
I may tell you what the halibut fisheries
problem means. There was a time when
halibut could be found at Plumper's Pass,
between Vancouver and Victoria, where the
little halibut boats, even rowboats and boats
of the smallest capacity, could go out and
catch day by day enough halibut to supply
the markets of Victoria and Vancouver. But
very soon boats from the American side predominated, and Canadian governments were
so oblivious to the situation that they
tolerated the poaching, as we in British
Columbia regard it, of large American fleets,
and made no serious effort to put an end to
it. The result is that the fishery, being
virtually uncontrolled, is on the verge of disappearing. What a few years ago was worth
countless millions is now down so low that
the reports of the Halibut Fisheries Commission-I refer particularly to No. 5-indicate
that after eight years it has made very little
progress in restoring the fishery. It gives us
no real assurance that it bas done anylthing
except to inquire into the situation, and it
acknowledges that the fish are becoming less
numerous every year. So extinction is still
easily possible.
I ask whether it is not worth the while
of Parliament to try to do something;
whether a committee of this House should
hesitate to engage in a study of the situation
with a view to keeping the subject alive and
preventing the extinction of a natural source
of wealth.
The third division of my subject is the
sockeye salmon of the Fraser. As I have
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

said, a convention was arranged with the
United States whereby we were to allow
Americans to come to Canada and put up
hatcheries and control the course of events
at the headwaters of the Fraser river. A year
after it was first presented that convention
was modified to a great extent, and in 1930
it was submitted to this Parliament in much
better form, and was passed. The United
States Senate, however, bas not yet consented
to it. As we are not acquainted day by day
with the negotiations in regard to treaties
of this kind, and very properly se, it is net
surprising that I do not know just where this
matter stands at present, and what is being
done. Certainly, however, something is being
negotiated, because there is a very strong
feeling in the ýState of Washington, as well
as in British Columbia, that something should
be done to control trap and seine operations
at the mouth of the Fraser. Would it not
be well for Parliament to attempt to find
out, in confidential sessions of the committee,
if necessary, just where the Salmon Convention stands at present, what is the nature of
the further concessions being asked from
Canada, and whether or not we should encourage our Government to grant those concessions?
Otherwise this convention may
come to us on the last day of this or some
other session-as it did in 1930-after having
been signed by our friends in the United
States. when it would not look well for us
to go back on it.
I am particularly interested in the sockeye
fishery problem. I live at New Westminster,
where we have, I suppose, about 3,000 white
fishermen-very
largely
of
Scandinavian
origin, and real fishermen-and 2,000 Japanese fishermen. These 5,000 men make their
entire livelihood out of the fisheries, except
for what they can serape out of their little
chicken and fruit farms of a few acres each.
It bas been suggested by authority that, in
the interest of a treaty with the United States
to help out the fisheries on both sides of the
line, these 5,000 citizens should be sacrificed;
that fishing with gill nets-which is the way
they fish-should be stopped, and that traps
and seines should be put at the mouth of
the Fraser te take all the fish that can be
caught. You will ask, "Who suggests this?"
It is not always suggested in the open. In
the 'Can-adian Annual Review, of which we
all receive a copy every year-a book published in Toronto and supposed; to be an
authority on any subject it deals with-I
have recently read a statement which,
although I do net know its origin and have
never heard it at home, is said to have
come from the Prime Minister of the day in

MARCH 13, 1934
British Columbia. IV was that unless this
salmon treaty was passed by the Sonate at
Washington, his Governinent would recoinmenti closing the Fraser river as a fishing
stream and making the mouth of the river
available for seining anid trap locations.
I suggest to this honoursble, House that
a senator who cornes from that district,
as 1 do, may ho excused if hie feels "ht thero
is some urgen-cy connecVed with the proposai
Vo destroy the livelihood of five thousand
people, to make their hoats and their nets
of nio account, and Vo render valueless their
houses and 1ittle gardens. If these mon are
forced Vo quit flshing they will have to move
to wherever Vhey can flnd work. Consequently this itatter is important to them.
Discussion on the prohlern is being kopt alive,
and just a few days ago I had a communication with respect to a largo delegation that
was Vo hiold a moeting at New Westminster
to deal with tho question. I thînk that the
Sonate would noV ho agreeablo to what is
proposed if it hiad a knowledgo of the facts
and an opportunity of making its influence
feit in time. I realize that if we wait until
tho convention with the Uni ted States is
signed it wîll ho too late then Vo mako a
change. I hopo it is not too late now.
I may say to honourable senators that I
have a considerable collection of literature
here, from whiýoh I arn prepared to read dates
and other partieulars, if desired. I do noV
think it is necessary; I therefore 'have spared
the House fromn listening Vo a discussion of
these details. I submit in all sinicerity that the
fisheries, under the heads I have meiltioned,
might very profitably ho referred Vo a coinm.ittee of this Huse, and it is on this account
that 1 inove the motion whioh stands in rny
naine, and which is seconded by the honourable senator frora Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard).
On motion of Hon. Mr. McRae, the debate
was adjourned.

THE WORK OF THE SENATE
INQUIRY-DIýSCUSSION CONTINUED

The Senate resumed frorn Thursday, March
8, consideration of the question proposed by
Hon. Mr. Murphy:
To caîl the attention of the Governrnent to
the work of the Senate and Vo, the efforts made
by the Senate Vo secure the initiation in this
House of Governrnent measures, and Vo inquire
if it is the intention of the Governrnent Vo
introduce je the Senate at an early date any
of the legisiation indicated in the Speech from
the Throne.

Hon. D. E. RILEY: Honourable senators,
I moved the adjournment of the debate, noV
with the intention of speaking on the question,
but at the request of an honourable senator
who was not then in the House, and I shahl
not take up more than a few moments of
your tirne to-day. When I first came Vo this
Chamber -I held the samne opinion that I
think the great mai ority of the people, particularly in Western Canada, hold to-day,
name]y, that the Sonate is an expensive and
useless appendage of our parliarnentary system. But since corning here and *observing
the important place that this body occupies
and the work it does, II have changed my
mind, and 1 believe now that the staternent
we so often hear, that the Senate is one of
the safeguards of our legishative system, is
quite true.
I think the principal reason for the impression prevailing in the West is that the
peoplc dûonot realize the importance of the
work that is done by this bouse. The only
way of correcting that impression is through
publicity je tho press. LaVely we have heard
the press severely criticized on the ground that
it pays very little attention Vo what is going
on here. There is, I think, some justification
for thaît criticism. For example, last session
our Standing iCornmittee on Agriculture and
Forestry held a number of sittings and heard
sorne very important evidence with regard to
the cattie industry, but the press gave very
littie publicity Vo any of that evidence.

part that is played by the Senate in the legislative life of this country. This is merely a
suggestion, and it is the only one I have to
make.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX:
Honourable senators, I have very little to add to the
excellent speeches which have been delivered
on the question so ably brought to the attention of the Ilouse by my honourable friend to
my rigÎýht (Hon. Mr. Murphy). My memnory
is carried back to 1884, when he and I were
desk-mates at the University of Ottawa. On
holidays we used to visit the galleries of the
Houses of Parliament, and look on at the
great men of the day who occupied the seats
of the mighty. H1e and I have always had
high regard for the Senate of the Dominion
and the House of ýComrnons. Back in those
days the Senate occupied a splendid hall,
possibly the most noted on this side of the
Atlanfic.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I agree with my
honourable friend from High River (Hon.
Mr. Riley) that the press might give more
prominýence t0 the deliberations and other
legislative activities of týhis body. But, after
ail, the Senate is what it is by virtue of the
worth of ifs members.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I arn proud to say
that aiýl honourable members appear to agree
wif h the sentiments expressed by my honourable friend who initiated this debate (Hon.
Mr. Murphy). His statements wsure clear-cuf;
his facfs and argurnents were marshalIled in a
masterly and luctid way. But for fear of causing him f0 blush, I should compare his speech
f0 one of Mr. Asquith's, of which Lord Curzon
said thaf the phrases were like tramping
soldiers marching past, with the sun glinting
on their bayonets. On, analyzing thaf speech,
I fiud the f ollowing outstanding features: (1)
the usefulness and necessify of the Senate
were amply demonstrated by the Fathers of
Confederation, and especiallly by Sir John A.
Macdonald; (2) there is a pressing need for a
strengthening of the relations between the
two Chambers, so as to secure for the Senate
its proportionafe share of legisiafive work in
fime for proper consideration; and (3) the
records clearly show in dollars and cents the
valuable protective services that the Senate
has rendered to the exehequer of Canada since
1867. These are but brief references to what
might he called the headlines of the admirable presentafion hy my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. RILEY.

My honourable friend who leads this side
of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) reminded
honourable members the other day of his long
services to Canada wifhin thés Chiamher.
Perhaps I shall be permaifted f0 say that 1 too
amn an old parliamenfarian, for I have sat continuously in this Chamber or the other almosf
forty ycars. I was a member of Parliament
when the late Lord Aberdeen called upon Sir
Wilfrid Laurier f0 become hýis chief adviser.
I have the same affection-shahl I say the
same fanaficism ?-f or parliamentary institutions that 1 had in my boyhood days, when
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Murphy) and
I used f0 histen f0 debates on important public
questions. On one aide of the House of Common-s there were then Sir John A. Ma;cdonald,
Sir Leonard Tilley, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir
Hector Langevin, Sir Adolphe Chapleau, Mr.
Thomas Whifte, Mr. Pope, Sir Adolphe Caron;
and on the other aide Alexander Mackenzie,
Edward
Blake, Sir
Richard Cartwright,
David Milîs, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Louis H.

Davies, Sir George

Ross,

and many others.

The other day, affer -reading a statement
dealing with the usefulness of Parliament,
I came to the conclusion that British parliamentary institutions, ahthough human and at
times failing to do the best that could have
been donc, have on the whole been a wonderfui asset for mankind. Many people, dismayed by the breaking up of parties on the
morrow of the World War, proclaimed the
uselessness of Parliament and the barrenneas
of its struggles. An English writer, who has
retained f ew illusions of men and institutions
after bis experience on the batfle-swepft fields
of Europe, answers them in these words,
which I commend to my honourable colleagues:
With ail its failiags of the front bench and
the party system. with its shani indignations
and slaim fights, Parliamnent is still the national
fortim in which ail grievanees corne up for
hearing, aIl opinions find expression, aIl conflicts
find a w ay of comipromnise.

loac our only safe-

gllar1 against uInderground1 conspiracy, or ope'n
tyranny. I'olifical passion would' find ifs vent
in other ways, by direct action and explosive
rebellion. Intolerance would have no safefy
valve. Looking around the wvorld to-day and
.ceing the decay of parliamentary sysf cm, and
its perilous resuits. w-e should, I think, find
somne consolation in our allegiance
to the
"I'alking Shop" af Westminster.
-Now, these words apply as wcll to Canada
as te, Great Brifain. I look upon the British
parliamentary system as the greateaf assef in
the world to-day, and as Canadians and
British subjects we should ding to if. When
after the French Revolution a man of genius

MARCH 13, 1934
turned Europe into an armed camp and proceeded from tbe Rbine to tbe Neya to enslave every nation, wben kings and emperors
were bending bel ore bis legions, one institution remained adamant and refused to yield.
That institution was the Parliarnent of Britain.
It saved Europe's civilization and the liberties
of tbe world.
The present situation after a war of unparalleled magnitude and unforeseen consequences should set us Canadians pondering
whither we are drifting. Russia, Italy, Germany are in the bands of dictators. Even
the United States of America bas practically
abdicated ail legislative power in favour of
its distinguisbed President, Mr. Roosevelt. It
cannot be denied tbat tbere is a law of
attraction in the affairs of this world. If we
are to rernain Canadians, imbued witb British
parliarnentary traditions, let us not drift
lightly into new forms, let us not accept new
theories of government. We rnust not only
preserve our institutions, we rnust consolidate
thern.
As bas been clearly dernonstrated by my
bonourable friend who sits to my right (Hon.
Mr. Murphy), tbere is a weak point in the
relations between our House of Commons
and our Senate. My rigbt bonourable friend
tbe leader of the House (Rigbt Hon. Mr.
Meigben) and my bonourable leader on the
left (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) have sbown very
clearly that the Senate is not treated fairiy
in the apportionment of legislative work. Bills
are received in this Chamber too hate. Wby?
Can we not be trusted with important measures at tbe very beginning of the session?
Did we not last session, at tbe instigation
and under the leadership of the right bonourable gentleman, pave tbe way for the railway
legislation which is now on tbe Statute Book?
Was any time lost, was any useless discussion
indulged in? I neyer before attended any
committee sa well led as was tbe Cornmittee
on Railways, Telegrapbs and Harbours last
session, and I neyer listened to a debate in
the Senate which was more admirable tban
tbe debate on tbe railway legislation. We
may bave differed on several points, but the
fact of the matter is that tbe most important
railway legislation ever brought before tbe
Parliarnent of Canada was passed promptly
after it bad been thoroughly diseussed botb
before tbe Committee and in the House.
Party spirit is neyer injected into our debates.
Therefore I submit we should obtain a fair
proportion of the legislative work. 'I may
be told that ahi bills corne before tbis House.
Yes, tbey are rusbed to tbis House. I arn
asking the right honourable gentleman-I arn
sure be feels bis responsibility, and we are

glad that he bas the responsibility, because
he has unquestionably the ability to discharge
itHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: -I would ask the
right honourable gentleman that frorn the
very beginning of the session the Senate
should receive a fair share of the legislative
work of the session. He can impose lis will
on the Government. Men of bis brain power
are scarce in the House of Commons and in
the Senate-tbey are scarce in Canada, and,
I repeat, he can impose his will. I think I
speak the mind of ail honourable members
when I say that much depends on the rigbt
bonourable gentleman obtaining from the
Government a fair share in the division of tbe
legislative work of the session between the two
Houses.
Before the public loses -its confidence in the
Senate we sbould have what for many years
we enj oyed, the presence of two, at lest, or
three ministers of the Crown on the floor of
this House. And their colleagues in the other
House should bave the right to appear in tbis
Chamber, as is the case in France. Last flu,
wbile in Paris, I saw ministers leaving the
Palais Bourbon and going to the Luxembourg
to explain Government measures to the
assemhly of which they were not members.
This is common sense. And our parliamentary
system is based on common sense. Why
sbould we hesitate in this matter? The rules
of the Senate might be amended to permit
ministers of the Crown to attend here to explain their measures, but, of course, not to
vote. It is true that the Senate does not
amend money bills, but I submit that the
Estimates sbould lie studied more closely by a
committee of this House. I was pleased to
bear my bonourable frîend from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) this afternoon give
notice of a motion ta tbat end. We cannot
amend a money bill, but wby should we not
discuss the Estimates? We are interested in
the good governrent of Canada and ini the
wise expenditure of ber revenues, and theref ore the Senate ougbt to be given the privilege
to scrutinize the Estirnates to see if certain
reductions migbt flot be advisable. I arn
pleased to find in a report from the Finance
Department that this year there bas been a
very drastic reduction of expenditure. By
scrutinizing the Estimates we migbt be able
to recommend furtber reductions.
Now, as regards the composition of the
Senate, would it not be well to select part of
our representation from arnong the provincial
legislatures, the boards of trade and the uni-

SENATE
versities? I go further. I arn expressing only
my personal opinion, and I do flot know
whether it may be shared by others, but I arn
inclined to think that the great churches of
this Dominion should have representatives
in this buse. As a Catholie I should be
pleased tu see here the Lord Bishup of the
Anglican Church of Ottawa, and 1 arn quite
sure my righit hionourable friend would nlot

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No, the United
Church.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: It is not so " united"
as that; but I will nlot pursue the subjeet,
for the reverend gentleman might flot be willing to attend. I remember that some years
ago, on the de-ath nf King Edward, the l-ate
Lord Grey, then. Governor General, was very
desirous of having a memorial service in
fr-ont of the. P01 liament Buildings. H1e wanted
the Anglican Bishop to read the prayers. Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, with bis long experience in
the government of Canada, said: "Beware,
Your Excellency! The other churcheswiili daim
the saine privilege." "But," said Lord Grey,
" His late MaIestv was head of the Anglican
Church, and therefore the Anglican Bishop
should read the prayers." Sir Wilfrid replied,
" 1 make no objecetion at ail, but I would
suggest tbat bei ore reaching a decision you
inquire, and ponder and pause." Lord Grey
said, " Ail rigbt, I will see you to-morrow."
Meanwhile ho consulted some of the Roman
Catholie bishops, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the General Superintendent
of the Methodist 'Church-there was no
United Church
then-and the Anglican
Bisbop. When he met Sir Wilfrid he said:
" I think you are right. They ail want to
have precedence one over the other. I think,
Sir Wilfrid, the best thing to do is to f-olîow
your .iudgrnent. We will have five minutes
oi silence before the Tnwer." And so the
ceremony took place: at the end ni five
minutes of reverent silence the band played

Hon.

Mr. LEMIEUX.

As honourable members are aware, bishops
sit in the House of Lords. The honourable
senator from Russell quoted these words oi
Sic John Macdonald frorn the Coniederation
Debates of 1865:
l'le legislature oi British North America
wvill be o 2uîpuec nf King. Lords andi Commons.
The Legislative Concil wvill stand in the samle
relation to the Lower House as the bouse of
Lords to the bouse of Comnmons in England,
liaviný- the sainle power oi iniitiating ail matters
ni legisiatinoi, except the granting ofi money.
I have listened f0 the debates in the buse
nf Lords on several occasions.
There the
Lords spiritual and the Lords temporal sit side

Judicial atmnsphere in which questions oi national import are discussed we shouýld not hear
the voice ni some ni those who represent the
great churches ni Canada. I arn speaking only
for myself; I do flot claim f0 speak for my
honourable friend the leader nif the bift. 1
mýay say that at the beginning ni the British
regime the Bishop ni Quebec, Monseigneur
Plessis, was a member oi the Legislative
Council. He was a very wise and prudent
man and undoubtedly one ni the greatest
bishops in the history ni Canada. True, there
was some littie trouble. My honourable friend
irom Grandiville (Hon. Mr. Chapais), who is
so well versed in Canadian history, might fell
us what brought about the bishop's resignation. I shnuld be pleased to sec some ni the
di.-nitaries ni our great churches in their red,
their violet and their black robes sitting in this
Chamber. If seems t0 me that their opinion
on many questions coming before us for consideration would be ni great service tn the
country.
With ail my heart I support the motion oi
my honourable frienil irom Russell (Hon. Mr.
Murphy). I amn pleased to see him in the
hest oi health, and I hiope lie wvill long continue to be an active member ni this C-hamber.

even by the extreme measure of dedlining
to consider buis, with certain exceptions,
hrought up froma the Commons within a fixed
period of the end of a session.
It happens that during the time I was
Speaker of the other House 1 came here on
several occasions and saw around the table
the late Hon. Mr. Béique-a close studcnt
of the legislation of this Parliament-the late
Sir James Lougheed, my friend the leader of
the lef t (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and my right
honourable friend frorn Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graharn). Whilst the other members of
the House wcre conversing, they were discussing a complex piece of legisiation with a
view to amending it. Thc Senate arnendments to that legishation later went to the
House of Commons and were approved.
I think perhaps 1 have trespassed long
enough on the time of the House. I thank
honourable members for their attention, and
I support with pleasure the proposai so ahly
presented by my old schoolmate at Ottawa
University.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the debate
is adjourned I should like to remind the
honourable member from Russeli (Hon. Mr.
Murphy) that he has forgotten many of the
occasions on which the Senate has effected savings.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: 'Is the honourable
gentleman going to speak now?
Hon. Mr. CA.SGRAIN: I am going to say
only a few words.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: 1 have moved the
adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAI'N: Let me say what
I have to say. It will not take a minute.
Many honourable senators will recali the
Skeena Railway project. At the time of the
Kiondyke gold rush there was a Bill to
authorize the building of a railway of about
one hundred and eighty miles in length. The
Senate killed the Bill and thereby saved some
59,000l,000 or more of good Canadian money.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: We were offermng no money; we were giving frozen lands.

0

Hon. Mr. ýCASGRAIN: In any event the
Senate prevented the building of that railway,
which otherwise, like many others, would
be on our hands now and costing us a great
deal of rnoney.
On another occasion a Bill providing for
the building of twenty-nine branch lines was
sent up to this House, and although there
was a Liberal Government in power, with a
Liheral mai ority in the Senate, the Bill was
killed in this House. The following year,
when twenty-nine branch uine hbis were
presented, only sorne of thern were all.owed to
pass. I1 suppose that even sorne of those.
that passcd should not have gone through.
The Senate has not been properly treated.
The right honourable gentleman (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) knows how many hours and
h.ow many days of travail we suffered last
year in the bringing forth of the Bill relating
to shipping in inland waters. That Bill, which
was sent to the other House, where it passcd,
was to corne into force by proclamation. But
it has neyer yet been proclaimed, the result
being that Canadian bottoms have had to
compete with those of other nations, a situation for which 1 think the Government is
to blame.
Now, just one more word and 1 arn through.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is another
feature that has not been mentioned. Where
in Canada can you find a body of men
who know more about this country than do
honourable members of the Senate? Within
twenty-four hours any member of this House
can secure information about any part of
Canada from. Cape Breton to British Columbia. A promoter may come along and
dlaima that there is oul or gold or something
else in a certain district, but anyone who cares
to go to the senator from the district in question can secure the very best and most disintcrestcd information in regard to it. That,
to my mmnd, is one of the most valuable
characteristics of the Senate. I arn sure that
any honourable member could learn nnything
he wanted to know about the province of
Quehec, right hack to the timne of Champlain,
fromn the honourable scnator from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Chapais), or about the city of
Winnipeg from the honourable member from
that city (Hon. Mr. McMeans). I defy contradiction when I say that from no other
body in Canada can information of this kind
be secured.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McMeaiss, the
debate was adjourned.

FRENCH TRANSLATION OF DEBATES
INQUIRY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable members, I should like to ask the right
honourable leader of the Government whether
it is the intention to appoint a translator of
Senate Hansard. Since the beginning of the
session I have net seen one French translater
of our debates. I learn from the question put
by my honourable friend from Mille Isles
(Hon. Mr. Prévost) that Mr. Potvin bas been
transferred to the Civill Service Commission.
Is there a translator te take his place and
give us a French translation of the debates?
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
that the French translating was done for some
years by Mr. Potvin, and done
very well,
although there were some arrears at the time
of his appointment te the Civil Service Commission. Thercafter the translating was donc
by Mr. DeMontigny, and, as I am advised,
admirably done. On his assumption of other
duties temporary provision was made for the
translation, but the expedient adopted is net
one that can be permanent.
I rather
apprelend that the situation will be taken
care of permanently, either at once or on the
passing of a Bill relating to translation which
is nov before the other House. In any event,
I can assure the House that adequate provision will be made for translation.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That is satisfactory.
HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES BILL
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Mr. PARENT: I rise to a question of
privilege. I happened to read last night in the
Journal an article which to my mind reflects
upon members of the Senate. It appears, with
headlines, as follows:
Sweepstakes
Bill
strongly
opposed
by

Considered and emphatic protest against the
Sweepstakes Bill, recently passed by the
Senate of Canada, was registered unanimously
at the opening session this morning. in

of Ottawa of the United Church of Canada.
under the chairmanship of Rev. J. Hurst, of
Manotick.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

A resolution

subnitted by Major the Rev.

Dr. T. J. Thompson, of Glebe Church, and
seconded by Rev. Dr. John W. Woodside, of
Chalmers Church. was adopted, without discussion, as follows:

"The Presbytery of Ottawa of the United
Church of Canada desires to register a considered and emphatic protest against the
Sweepstakes Bill recently passed by the Senate
of Canad.a.

and soon to be submitted

in the

House of Commons.
"We

dian people by projecting a measure at once
unethical, economically unsound, and morally
disintegrating.
"We are confident that the responsible representatives of the Canadian electorate in

the

House of Comnions will reject this measure."

these people would be to have this article
inserted in Hansard, for future generations to
take ceognizance of it.

Hon. Mr. PARENT: At the moment I have

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Which shows they
are wrong.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The newspapers have made a mistake, or have been
badly info-rmed.
The statement has been
published all over the land that we have
passed this Bill, whereas it bas been given
only two readings and is only partially dealt
with in Committee of the Whole.
The

it in committee.
GOVERNMENT

SALARIES

AND

WAR

RETURN

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
I wish to draw the attention of the right
honourable leader of the Government to a
return brought down yesterday in response
to an order moved in my name last session.
I really asked a question, but the right bonourable gentleman suggested that it be made
an order for a return, and I had no objection.
I want to find out the total amount paid by
the Government in salaries to the Civil Service, including all boards and commissions,
and in pensions for war service, for the year
ending March 31, 1933. The return which the
right honourable gentleman laid on the table
yesterday gives a mass of information, but

MARCH 14, 1934
without any detail, and I should like to ask
him if hie would see that the question is
answered in the f orm in which it was asked.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shali have
the matter looked into, and if the answer is
incomplete it will be made complete.
THE WORK 0F THE SENATE
INQUIRY-DISCUSSION

OONTINUED

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday consideration of the question proposed by Hon.
Mr. Murphy:
To cail the attention of the Governiment to
the work of the Senate and to efforts made by
the Senate to secure the initiation in this
House of Government measures, and to inquire
if it is the intention of the Government to
introduce in the Senate at an early date any
of the legisiation indicated in the Speech from
tho Throne.

Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable senators,
when 1 moved the adjournment of the de'bate
I had no intention of trying to add anything
to the learned arguments that had been presented. I wanted chiefly to congratulate the
honourable gentleman from Russell (Hon. iMr.
Murphy) upon his very interesting and instructive address. May I respectfully suggest
to him that, as hie bas given us so good a
treatise, hie should proceed further and write
a book on the work of the Senate. I do not
knaw anyone who is better qualified, or who
feels more strongly than hie the need for such
a book. There are, to my knowledge, two
works dealing with the Sen-ate. One was
written in 1914 by the Hon. Sir George
Ross, who deals principafly with the constitutional aspects of this body. And in 1926
there was published "The Unreformed Senate
of Canada," by Professoir Robert A. Mackay,
a book with which I presume ail honourable
members are familiar. I do not like the
titie of it. Professor Mackay has assembled
a great deal of information, but much of
it is misleading, and I must ýsay that I
with many of his conclusions.
disagerç
With due respect to the honourable senator
from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy), may 1 say
that hie oveTlooked many actions of the
Senate whereby rooney bas been saved to the
people of Canada. If hie inquired a littie
further into the matter hie would lind that the
total savings effected by this House have been
very much in excess of the amount hie mnentioned. The honourable gentleman from.
West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) reminded us of the matter of the Crowsnest Pass rates, and the honourabie senator
froro De Lanaudière (-Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
pointed out the Yukon Railiway Bill. There
were ma.ny other instances of the same kind.

157

I remnember the omnibus railway Bill that
was sent over from. the House of Commons,
calling for an expenditure of some $40,000,000.
The Senate refused to pass that measure
because it was of the opinion that the different roads mentioned therein should have been
dealt with iseparately. I arn sure that the
honourable gentleman could discover many
other matters upon which the Senate bas
taken action that bas subsequently proved
wise and refiected credit upon this House.
Another instance tout cornes to mmnd is the
Niagara Power Bill, which I remember very
well. Af ter a big lawsuit the city of Toronto
was asking for the passage of certain retroactive legislation, and about $30,000,000 of
Niagara Power Company bonds wcre in
danger of becoming worthless. The United
States was keenly interested in the affair and
the Assistant Attorney-General of that country came over here and preigented certain
arguments for the consideration of the
Senate. In the end we made a compromise
and amended the Bill. As a result the city
of Toronto was displeasied and sent a protest
to -many cities and other municipalities
throughout the Dominion, asking themn to
join in a demand for the abolition of this
body.
I will not take up the time of the Senate
by making further references to such matters.
In the book to which I have already referred,
Professor Ma.ckay contends that the Senate
no longer protects the rights of the different
provinces. In my opinion hie is wrong. I
concur in the absolutely contrary opinion expressed by Sir George Ross, thaýt the protection of such rights is the chief function of
this honourable body. Professor Maýckay says
the mere fact that every province is given
representation in the Cabinet is a sufficient
guarantee that the interests of the provinces
will not be neglected by the Government of
the day. I do not think any honourable
senator will agree with hiro. I cannot see why
the Senate was constituted if not for the very
purpose of protecting provincial rights. Books
of this kind are widely read, and unless its
erroneous statements are contradicted they are
likely to be taken as the absolute truth. For
this reason I would urge the honourable merober from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy) to exercise his literary ability and put into book
form his profound knowledge of our parliamentary institutions.
I cannot agree with some of the observations made yesterday by the honourable
gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
He suggested that our great
Lemieux).
churches, our universities, and other bodies

SENATE
be given representation in the Senate of Canada. Perhaps after I have read what the
learned professor from Cornell University
thinks about the matter my honourable friend
may become a convert to his views.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
Dalhousie University.

He is a graduate of

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He is described on
the title page of his book to be Assistant
Professor of Government at Cornell University. I think he was a graduate of Toronto
University. Cornell granted him a six months'
holiday so that he might write a book on the
Senate of Canada. Instead, he has written
this book on "The Unreformed Senate of
Canada." I do not agree with all the learned
gentleman's opinions. His work reminds me
of the literary efforts of another gentleman"Four Days in China," in six volumes.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: A Chinese puzzle.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: This quotation from
"The Unreformed Senate of Canada" is for
tho benefit of my honourable friend from
Rougemont:
The necessity for an Upper House, composed
for the nost part of experienced legislators,
becomes the more apparent when we consider
the luctuating membership of the House of
Commons. For exanple, ont of a total of 235,
the election of 1921 brought in 113 new members who had no experience even in a provincial legistature. 54 members who had served
one terni in Parliament, and only 48 members
who had served longer. While this 'turn-over'
was inordinately large because of the rise of
the Progressive Party, at every election many
mcmbers of the House of Commons fall out.
Such changes may be necessary to meet changes
in public opinion, but they make for poor
legislation. The extent to which the Senate
conserves experience is borne out by the table
given above which classifies members according
to experience in public life.
I direct my honourable friend's attention
particularly to this passage:
Moreover, it is a fair question whether an
Upper House ought to be an assembly of
notables. It is a common assumption, but a
questionable one, that eminent professors,
scientists and authors ought to gravitate
towards an Upper Chamber equally with
successful business men and politicians. Yet
does a knowledge of the intricacies of the atom
or the ability to write learned books constitute
a passport to a political assembly?
Italy's
Senate is founded on that principle, but
appears to have no more political influence,
and bas certainly less real power, than has
the Senate of Canada. Probably no other
Upper Chamber in the world bas in its
mnembership so many expert administrators and
legislators, or so many eminent financiers,
journalists, scientists, and men of letters as
has the British House of Lords, yet the House
of Lords is a weak body. The assumption that
an Upper Chamber should be composed of
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS

notables resembles closely the common fallacy
of democracy that every man is a potential
governor. Were the Senate an assembly of
university presidents, railway builders, merchant princes, financiers and labour leaders,
the position of senator might entail more
honour, but it is extrenely doubtful whether
the Iouse itself would have more power or
political influence than it has to-day. What is
required in the membership of an Upper
Chamber, when the Lower makes and unmakes
governuments and controls the purse and public
policy, is net so much eminence as qualities
whicl m.ake for good legislation, familiarity
with the nation's problems in general and in
detail, and a sufficient degree of independence
to face the waves of popular prejudice which
frequently affect the Lower House. In a word,
it is to compensate for the weaknesses of the
membership of the Lower House, which are the
w eaknesses of democracy itself-lack of special
training, provincialism, and prejudice.
This should be a sufficient answer to the
honourable member's desire to introduce
clerics, professors and scientists into the membership of this Chamber in preference to
ordinary men who can feel the public pulse.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He wants bishops
and moderators to become senators.
Hon. Mr. -MeMEANS: I do not know
whether they would be at al.1 conversant with
public opinion in matters affecting the country
at large. I am merely calling the attention
of the honourable gentleman to these views.
I have the greatest respect for his political
wisdom, based upon long experience in public
affairs, and I apologize to him if he finds
himself unable to agree with the learned
author.
Turning to page 136 of this book, I find the
professor reached these conclusions:
Tl'he Senate is not se much a check on the
House of Commons as it is upon the Cabinet,
and there can be no doubt that its influence
in this respect is salutary.
Then he quotes Sir Clifford Sifton:
In twenty years at Ottawa I have never
known a case in which a Government was
anxious to take the verdict of the people on
a Bill rejected by the Senate.
May I read one further paragraph:
The Senate to some extent has protected
Parliament against the encroachments of the
Cabinet. This is particularly to be observed
in the amending of varions government railway
bills. . . .

And,

incidentally, it

may not be

going too far to say that the Senate bas saved
the country in actual cash. by such activity,
more than the total cost of its upkeep since
federation.
The honourable senator from Russell (Hon.
Mr. Murphy) has already drawn the attention
of the House to this national saving.
I do not deem it necessary to attempt to
controvert in detail the learned author's con-

MARCH 14, 1934
clusion that the Senate has failed to protect
the rights of the provinces. It will suffice
to cati attention to the Lake of the Woods
Bill, wbich was twice passed by the Commons
and twice rejected by this House. By this
action the Senate upheld the dlaim of the
province of Manitoba to a very valuabie
hydro-electrie power site on the Winnipeg
river. The honourabie leader on the other
side (Hon-. Mr. Dandurand) will recail that hie
was strongiy in favour of the Bill. What was
the resuit of its rejection by the Senate? An
arrangement was reached satisfactory to both
parties. In my opinion this case clearly shows
that the Senate has neyer failed to carry out
one of the main purposes for which it was
founded-the protection of provincial rîghts.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Also the protection of
minorities.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Quite so. A matter
which I consider of major importance bas
flot yet been touched on in the course of this
debate. The Senate has always had the right
to introduce public bills, and in this respect
it stands i a different position from. the other
House. What I complain of is the situation
in regard to public hills that originate i the
Senate; and if any change in the rules is contemplated this should be 'borne in mind.
A Bill originating in the Senate and dealing
with a matter of great interest is referred to
a committee. That committee, after hearing
evidenoe in regard to it, and giving the
sùbject-matter careful consideration, returns
the Bill to the Senate, where it is read the
third time and passed. But although the Bill
bas been passed by a House in which there
are one ex-Prime Mînister of Canada, fourteen ex-Cabinet Ministers, and two ex-Prime
Ministers of provinces-and surely that means
something-the senator who bas sponsored it
here has to hunt up some private member of
the House of Commons wbo will undertake
to introduce it in the other Chamber, and
the consequence is that any one of the 245
members of that House can taik out the Bill,
regardless of the time and labour we have
expended upon it.
Take for instance the Bill to establish
divorce courts in Ontario. That Bill, whicb
dea-it wjth a controversial subjeet, was paseed
by this House four times. Hoiw far did it
get in the House of Commons? Three times
it fei! by the wayside, and the fourth time
flot a singie mem-ber of either of the great
political parties dared to introduce it in the
other House. There wae one independent
meimber in that House, however, the leader
of the C.C.F., who took charge of the Bill.
But it was defeated. The f ollowing session

159

hie introduced it bimself and finaliy got it
tbrough. I couid mention several similar instances.
Let me take the case of a Bill which I
had the bonour of introducing-a Bill to
etablish appeais in criminal cases. A committee of this House considered it during two
sessions. We circuilarized ail the judges of
this Dominion, and ail the Attorneys-Oeneral
in the différent provinces, and secured
evideece as to the working of a sîmilar Act
in England. Yet, notwithetanding the fact
that we had devoted a great deai of time
and work to the Bill, when it reached the
other House it wae reduced, to the status of
a private bill.
Hon. Mr. -CA'SGRA'IN: Oh, no. If it is
a public bill in this House it is a public
bill in the other House.
I beg beave to
Hon. Mr. McMEiANS:
differ. I had to take that Bill myseif and
hunt up a member Vo introduce it. The
present Judge Tweedie, of Calgary, introduced
it, 'but it neyer got beyond the initial stage.
He, was a .private member.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAN:

It is a public bill.

Hon. Mr. McME&ANS: But it has to be
introduced by a private member, and if you
cannot secuire the consent of the Government
to, it you will get nowhere. The Bili that I
refer to passed this House unan.imously, but it
was impossible to get it through the other
Huse. Finally its provisions became law
through wbat 1 m.ight cal! a fluke: the other
House sent up here a Bill Vo amend the
Criminal. Code, this bouse inserted in it the
provisions that 1 had sponsored, and when
it was sent baok the House of Commons
accepted those provisions in order to preserve
the Bill.
If there is to be a change in the cules, it
should cover such cases, because no member
will introduce a public bill in this Chamber
unýless be knows it is going to receive somne
consideration at the bands of the other
bouse.
I .need not take up your time any longer,
honourable mnemJbers. I hope the honourable
gentleman frorn Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy)
wiil incline bis ear to what I have said. I
arn sure that if hie doe we shall ail be
indebted Vo him, and ihe resuiýt will redound
to the credit of the Senate of Canada.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable senators, like other honourable members of this
bouse, since the commencement of this debate
by the honourable member from Russell (Hon.
Mr. Murphy) 1 have been reflecting upon

'IU

SENATE

various phases of the question of how we can
make the time we spend here of greater value
to the country. This bas led me to a consideration of a certain ferm of service which
bas not yet been mentioned. I speak of the
work done by the various select committees
of the Senate from year to year. Almost every
year these committees have made a valuable
contribution to our knowledge, or at all events
to the collecting and arranging of information
for presentation to the House.
Naturally, I recall first the committees
whose meeting I have attended, and of which,
in some cases, I have been a member. About
1919 a committee was appointed, under the
presidency of the late Senator Fowler, to
consider the navigability of the Hudson Bay
and Straits. At that time the honourable
gentleman opposite who smiles at me (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) submitted views which he still
holds, and which lie lias just recently presented to us with equal force.
Another committee J recall was the one
appointed to consider the machinery of government. It studied exhaustively the question
of making parliamentary government more
effective. I regret to say that the honourable
the leader on the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and myself are the only surviving
members of that committee. Only the other
day I looked over its report, and I think we
will both agree, even after the passage of
years, that it did a very creditable piece of
work.
A committee on the St. Lawrence Waterways met under the chairmanship of the
honourable senator from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) and gathered together and crystallized
in concise form much valuable information.
Some honourable members will recall the
committee on the Fuel Supply of Canada;
also the efforts made by the late Senator
Nicholls of Toronto, who through more than
one special committee brought before the
House various schemes for promoting the
industrial life and the prosperity of Canada at
a time when there were many difficult problems to be faced by the Government and by
the people of the country.
Then I would call the attention of the
honourable senator from Russell (Hon. Mr.
Murphy) to the action of the Senate committee on the Hoppe leases. I remember the
July heats in which the report of that committee was adopted. Certainly there has
been no evidence since of any intention to
controvert the position taken by that committee, which by its recommendation saved
to this country an extremely valuable deposit
of coal, some eighteen thousand square miles
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN.

in extent, and estimated at something like two
hundred million tons. At the same time that
committee made some very valuable suggestions to the Government in regard to regulatiens for the control of vast potential sources
of wealth of this kind, urging that they should
not be handed over to private individuals
without an adequate return to the State.
Coming down to later times, we reca,1l that
the honourable senator from High River
(Hon. Mr. Riley) last session told us of the
work dono by the Committee on the Commerce and Trade Relations of Canada. He
informed us that the evidence it gathered on
the cattle expert business was sought out and
used at the Imperial Conference, greatly to
the advantage of the Canadian side of the
case, and carried the day in the dealings between representatives of the United Kingdom and those of Canada. Good work has
been done also by the Committee on Agriculture, which continues its labours.
I think that nobody Who bas spoken in this
debate realizes more distinctly than I do
the advantages of press publicity. Speaking
to fewer than four score persons, no matter
how effectively, one feels that what one says
will carry but a short distance without the
publicity that comes through the press. What
is said here is sent out in condensed form by
press wire to the various newspaper offices of
Canada, and only what the men at the desks
in those offices regard as news with a capital
N is published. It is net a great deal.
What is the reason? The reason is, it seems
to me, that nothing follows from these good
reports of ours. Those who have been connected with the various committees, and whose
views are embodied in their reports, are inclined to believe that the material is excellent,
but that about the time when the reports are
to be adopted by this House there is injected
a virus from which death ensues. That virus,
I think, is the lack of sanction behind the
committees' recommendations.
I do net know of any way in which we in
our present corporeal condition can make
recommendations so good, so deep, so effective
and so practical that the press, the country,
and those who adrninister its affairs will give
them the attention they merit. I fear, that,
human nature and our system of administration being what they are, unless we become
supermen we shall have to wait a long time
for recognition.
But I do not want to conclude my remarks
on a discouraging note. There is another
phase of public service connected with the
workings of ;this House. I think that we have
all been struck with the tremendous amount

which he was vitally interested-would he
be willing to go to the House of Commons
to present that measure, if he had the legal
right to do se? Suppose the Commons were
short of work and elamouring for more, and
that we were overworked, would any niember
of this House willingly go to the other House
rather than stand up here and introduce his
measure? Ccrtainly not. Hcre he has friends
and acquaintances whom ie meets every day.
In the other place he would be among comparative strangers. And this would be all
the more so if the position were reversed, if
a member of the Commons came over here
to introduce legislation. In his own House,
if he is a minister, he can feel assured of a
sympathetic and friendly majority in the
audience; he would net be a minister if that
were not se. But if he came here, especially
if it were soion after a general election, he
might find himself faced witlh a hostile
assembly. There is every reason, to my
mind, why any minister or any private mentber should prefer, and properly prefer, to
present his case before the assembly in whlich
he holds his seat.
In the old days of which I was speaking this
very question was a matter of annual
grievance. Both the ministers to whom I have
alluded, the Secretary of State and the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, used to
argue in Council that it was outrageous for
the Sonate to be adjourning because of nothing
to do when there were in hand plenty of
Government measures which could just as well
be presented in the Sonate as in the Commens. But the trouble was that they could
not get any of their colleagues from the
Commons to take the same view. On one
occasion when I was in the Department of
Justice and had sene comparatively unimportant amendmuents to the criminal law and
to other public measures, whichb it was agreed
should be introduced, dear old Mr. Scott came
to me personally and in private conversation
asked, "Won't you let me take these things
into the Senate first?" J had to tell hin that I
was net willing. And by way of argument I
asked him: "Would you do a similar thing
yourself, Mr. Scott? Would you let me introduce one of your State Department bills in
the House of Commons first?" He replied
that he would rather handle his own work.
Now, that is simply human nature; that
would bo true with any of us. And so, in
my judgment, even if we had ministers of the
Crown in this body, as we always used to
have-and as, I venture to say with great
respect, we ought still to have--we should not
be any nearer to a solution of this ancient
problem. The ministers among us would be

Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

introducing their own publie legislation here,
but that is all. I agree, and I think everybody must agree at once, with the remark of
the right honourable gentleman who leads the
louse (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), that before
we can ask or hope for the introduction first
in this House of more public nmeasures, we
must, as a prerequisite, have soie ministers
with portfolios as members. And I think we
may just as well recognize now that there
is no reasonable expectation of any of us
seeing that prerequisite fulfilled in the future.
The trouble is that a practice in the opposite
direction was begun. One Prime Minister,
the predecessor of the present one, toek the
position when forming his Cabinet in 1926
that all bis ministers with portfolio were to
be and ought to be in the House of Comnions.
The right honourable gentleman went so far, J
ai sorry to say, as to declare more than once
in the lHouse of Commons that his Cabinet
was a committee of that House. J venture to
observe that as a matter of constitutional
practice or constitutional law it was nothing
of the kind; but, that Prime Minister bhxing
taken such a position, his successors are
likelv to follow it. Although we recently
had bere for a few years our greatly lamented
friend the first Minister of Labour in the
present Government, we now have no minister
with portfolio, and I doubt that we are ever
likely to have another. So I think it is
impracticable te hope that any greater anount
of public legislation will be introduced first
into this House.
We can look for additional work only in
regard
the direction of private hills. In ltat
the practical difliculties in the way ma., J
think, be more rasily ovxercome. No extensive
amendment of the rules of either House would
be necessary; indeed, periaps a complete
reversal of the present order of tiigs could
ho broutght about under the present rules.
We alIl know that ever since Confederation
all divorce bills have been introduerd in the
Sonate. As a matter of history I do not know
how it came about. but I hav e always understood that the Prime Minister of that day,
Sir John A. Macdonald, simply said to his
tolleagues in the Sonate, "Now, you take
divorce." The Sonate was willing to do the
work, the Commons was equally xilling that
the Sonate should do it, and se from that
day to this all divorce bills have been introduced and dealt with first in this assembly.
Is there any reason why exactly the same
course should net be followed with respect
to all private bills? The right honourable
leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) suggested
that the sponsor of a private bill in the

MARCB 14, 1934
buse of Commons might have the measure
given its flrst reading there, that it should
then 'be independently introduced bere, and
after being given third reading heme its
further consideration should be resumed in
the Commons. But what is the advantage or
necessity of such procedure? Why should not
every private bill, a.s a matter of necessity,
be introduced flrst in the Senate and after
third reading be sent to the House of Commons? If this course can be followed without
difficulty in the case of divorce bis, it should
be equaliy without practical difficu.ity witb
respect to ail private bills. The real and only
impediment in the way is the unwillingness
of the sponsor in the bouse of Commons to
have his bill intro.duced in another Chamber.
That difficulty is of a sort inherent in human
nature, but you can overcome it by an arrangement such as was made, I think, in regard'to
divorce bis.
I do not believe there would be the least
practical advantage in setting up a joint
comimittee of the two Houses to consider this
question. As the honourable leader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) explained the
other day, there wvas formerly such a joint
committee, but its deliberations came to
naught. If we set up a small committee to
aet jointiy with a corresponding committen
of the buse of Commons, 1 very much doubt
wvhether there would ever be any praotical
outcome from their conferences. The truth is
that everybody likes to exercise any power that
he possesses, and no one will willingly surrender it. This feeling, coupled with the
natural prefemence of a member to address an
assembly of bis more intimate friends and
acquaintances, will a.Iways operate strongly
against any proposai that the sponsor of a
private bill sbouid introduce it elsewhiere than
in the Chamber of whicb hie is a member.
With regard to the detailed consideration
of private bills, everybody knows that the
real work is done in committee. Any member
of the Bouse of Commons should bave the
right to attend and to explain to the committee the provisions of any bill in the passing of Whi.ch be felt a special interest. So far
as 1 can see, in Vhat respect no change would
be required in the rules of either Bouse.
As to working out the details by which ail
private buis muet corne first to the Senate,
I think it can be best arranged in the way
suggested, that is, by the personal intervention of the right honouable 4eader of this
Bouse. Ail we can do is te strengthen his
hands in the undertaking to which by bis
remarks in this debate he lits already comrnitted himself. I do not think it wouid be
of advantage to appoint any formai com74728-11J

163

mittce. But are we flot able to give to the
right honourable leader of the Bouse our
unanimous support in bis effort to prevail
upon his colleagues in the Cabinet, and especiaIly upon the Prime Minister, to arrange, by
whatever change -in the mules of the Bouse
of Commons may be necessary, that in future
sessions ail private bills shall, as is now the
case with divorce bis, be introduced in the
Senate?
Just a word or two on a point that I had
overlooked. The sponsor of any private bill,
either in this Bouse or in the Bouse of Coinmens, is, in point of fact, most likely to be
the choice of the solicitor who bas prepared
the measure. The solicitor advîses bis client
on the requisite procedure to obtain the desircd legislation. Then in ail probability hie
is instructed to proceed, and 'he seleets some
member of the Bouse of Commons to sponsor
the bill. Be mîght just as welI select a member of the Senate if tbe mules reqoired, as they
do in divorce proceedings, that private bis
shouid be first introdoced here. I believe
that is the only practical solution of the
matter w.hich the honourable senator from
Russell (Bon. Mr. Murphy) has so ably
brought to our attention.
On motion of Bon. Mr. Buchanan, the debate was adjourned.

the reports of the Auditor General, together
with curient accounts, and the Estinates for
the fiscal year 1934-35, with power to send for
persons, papers and records; to employ counsel
and clerical and stenographie assistance as
required; and that the said committee be
composed of the Honourable SenatorsHe said: Honourable senators, this motion
is largely a result of the very interesting
debate initiated by the honourable member
from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy) on the
work of the Senate. Several honourable members have discussed with me the desirability
of having a special committee appointed to
consider and report upon the public accounts
of Canada and the reports of the Auditor
General, together with current accounts and
the Estimates, with a view to helping the
Government in its efforts to eut down
expenditures wherever possible.
Finance enters into many of the activities
of government. At one time the Senate Standing Coimittee on Finance examined the
public accounts and the Auditor General's
report, and summoned before it the Auditor
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

General to furnish information on the operation of his office and as to certain payments.
This excellent work has not been carried on for
some years. Now the Supply Bill is sent over
to us in the last hours of the session and we
are expected to pass it perfunctorily. We
know the powers of the Senate are limited.
We have no power to initiate measures which
call for public expenditure, but it is well
established by authorities on constitutional law
that we have power to amend money bills by
reducing the amounts therein. I submit that
it is not only our right but our duty to
examine very carefully every money bill
referred to this Chamber, and, if deemed
advisable, to amend it for the national good.
This motion is made, not in any spirit of
criticism, but solely in the hope that by a
very careful consideration of the national
finances we may help the Government and thus
benefit the Dominion.
Of the many questions which to-day are
engaging the attention of the thinking people
of Canada while, as we hope, we are emerging
from the depression which first became apparent in 1929, there is perhaps nothing of
greater interest to the public generally than
the question of debt and taxation. However
optimistic we may be, we cannot ignore the
fact that the volume of our national, provincial
and municipal debts is increasing at an alarming rate, with the inevitable result that taxation is becoming so burdensome that wc
scarcely know how we shall be able to meet
the demands of the future. Therefore I am
confident that a thorough examination of
national finance by a strong committee of the
Senate would be of great benefit to every
citizen of this country.
A study of the question of debt and interest
opens up a very wide field. The desirability
of reducing the rate of interest is being
discussed not only in Canada, but all over
the world. The best method of bringing
about further economies in public expenditures is also of prime importance. I believe
that by studying these matters and scrutinizing the Estimates we might be able, notwithstanding constitutional limitations, to
render the Government and the country very
valuable assistance.
I have tistened with a great deal of
interest to the current debate in this Chamber
on the work of the Senate. Undoubtedly the
Fathers of Confederation were wise when
they followed the old English precedent of a
bicameral Parliament, and I am convinced
that it would be a very grave mistake to
abolish the Senate. Indeed, I question the
wisdom of some of the provinces-although
perhaps this is going beyond the scope of

MARCH 15, 1934
the motion-in doing away with their legisiative councils. Had they been retained, those
second chambers would in ail probability have
proved a salutary check on the -tremendous
increase of public debt which the provinces
are now lamenting.
Much has been said on the question of
publicity for our debates.
Naturally the
activities of the Senate do not oommend
themselves to the notice of -the newspapeTs
of the Dominion as much as does the work
of the other Chamber, but possibly the
Senate itself is in a measure to blame for this
lack of interest in its proceedings. It seems
to me that we should not take a fault-finding
attitude, but should try to initiate somethîng,
to make use of the power we have, and to
do work which, wilI commend itseIf to the
newspapers. I can suggest at least one way
in which we could get publicity, if we wanted
it, and that is to hold an inquiry into the
newspaper combine in Canada.
An Hon. SEINATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: There is, I suppose,
no other combine in this Dominion as efficient and thorough, or such a close corporation,
as the newspaper combine.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I say this, not by
way of criticism, but simply to point out a
method by which we could get aIl the
publicity we might desire.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The newspapers would charge you ten cents a line for it.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:- Why do you not propose
such an inquiry?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Why do I not propose it? I have suggested it, and it is
probably the first time such a suggestion bas
been made in this Huse. Knowing something about newspaper work, as I do, 1
think it would be an exceedingly interesting
investigation.
il am flot going to take up the tîme of the
House further with this proposal. I simply
desire, with the best of goodwill, to set it in
motion. 1 should be very sorry indeed to
tread on the toes of the Committee on
Finance, but as it has not seen fit to be very
active, and a number of members of this
House would like to see some activity along
this line, I am acting as their mouthpiece.
The committee which I propose would be a
special eommittee, appointed for this session
only, and if for a little while it should encroach on the work the Finance Committee
is supposed ta do, I should hope to be forgiven.

165

With these few words, honourable members,
1 wish to move the motion which bas been
read, and to suggest that the followîng senators compose the committee: Honourable
Senators Murphy, Buchanan, Foster, Parent,
Lacasse, Copp, Donnelly, Griesbach, Black,
Tanner, McRae, Dennis, Sharpe, Horner,
L'Espérance and the mover.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGREN: Honourable members, the very brief consideration
I. have been able to give to the terms of this
motion does not lead me to think that any
of the powers given to the committee, as
detailed in the motion, save possibly the
power to employ counsel and other experts
and to incur expense, are beyond those
possessed by the Finance Committee. I sc
no reason for objecting to the passage of this
motion if it is not taken as iînplying that
expenses may be incurred hy the committee
and become a charge upon the Administration
without the passage of the motion that is
usual in such cases. I do not want to say
there will be a refusai of any such assistance,

On the other hand, I do not want it to be
implied, simply because -this motion carnies,
that the Government is assuming extraordinary expense.
Hon. RAOUJL DAINDURAND:
Honourable members, I would remind the Senate
that there bas been but one attempt to refer
a Supply Bill to, our Finance Committee since
its inception. I was then sitting on the other
side of the Houise. A motion to refer a
Supply Bill to that committee was made in
the very last days of the session, but I objected on the ground that the Senate could
not profitably undertake a study of the Bill
at that late stage.
I welcome the suggestion of the honourable
gentleman from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) that during the session there should be
an examination of the public accounts, the
Estimates and the Auditor General's report,
with a view to modifications and reforms of
various kinds that migbt be helpful to the
Government in power. The recommendations
of such a committee migbt very well be discussed when it made its report to the Senate.
1 heartily agree with the motion.
Hon. Mr. MaoARTHUR: I am fully in
accord with the objeet of this motion, but,
judging from the remarks of the right honourable leader of the House, 1I should take it
that this special committee would have special
powers that do not pertain ta the Finance
Committee, which, although appointed fromn
year ta year, bas neyer functioned. 1 should
like to ask the right honourable leader ta

Hon. Mr. D ,ý.NDURAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Tue Canadicîn Pcîcific Rcciiway and the Canaclian Ncational Rcîilways use Jointly certain prcmiscs
in Sciint Johin, Ncw Brunîswick, foc terminal
andi otiier purpeses. The Canaclian Nationcal

interest. silice tPe titie is in the Crown, in
the right of the Dominion of Canada, the
property bnaving fermerly beiongcd te the
Intercolonicîl Railway.
An agreemnent was entered into on the first
day cf January, 1927, for the joint use of
premises for a pcriod of twenty years, and it
was provided that, if ratified by Parliament
within that period, the agreement sheîîld continue in force for ninety-nine ycars. The railway eompany. bas net power te enter into
engagements of this kind for longer than
twenty-one years, witihoîit parliamentary sanctien. If ratification is given now, the agreement will be validated for ninety-nine years.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:c
An emphyteutic

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: The purpose
of this measure is te give that ratification.
I may say that there is a coxnpanîon
measure, which has to do with the joint use
of certain tracks and premises at Belleville.
The period of time provided in that agreement bas virtually expired; se, action mnust be
taken. It was thought expedient that as the
Belleville agreement was ýcoming up for validation, we 8houhd deal at the samne time with

the Saint John agreement, although oniy
about seven years out of the twenty deflniteiy
provided for therein have expired.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But in Belleville
the land does flot belong to the Federal Government. It is not the samne thing at ai'!.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI-GHEN: It beiongs
to The Camplieliford, Lake Ontario and Western Railway Company, but it had flot the
powcr to make an agreement for longer than
twenty years.
flight Hon. Mr. GRA'HAM: Honouraibie
members, I do not know much about this
Saint John agreement, but 1 presumne the
matter hias been investigated by the officiais
of both railways and in addition by the
Trustees of the National Raiiways.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And I suppose the same is true of the Belleville agreement. One of the parties named in that
agreement wouid perhaps flot be found iisted
as a going concern to-day, but ratification
of the agreement is essential to the successfui
operation of other interested lines. I suppose
the Bill will go to the Raiiway Committee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
Campbeiiford, Lake Ontario and Western
Raiiway is, 1 understand, a part of the Canadian Pacifie Raiiway.
Rîglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is another
name for the Canadian Pacifie line from its
original main line.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CANADIAN NORTHERN ONTARIO
RAILWAY COMPANY BILL
SECOND READING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
second reading of Bull 24, an Act to ratif y
and confirmn an agreement made between The
Canadian Northern Ontario Raiiway Company
and The Campbeiiford, Lake Ontario and
Western Railway Company.
He said: Honourabie members, this is the
BiHl to, ratify the Belleville agreement, to
which I referred when dealing with the precedmng measure. Ini this case the full period
of time for which the railways hiad. power to
make the agreement has expired; so, uniess
Parliament acta the agreement will no longer
be in force.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it to he validated
for ninety-nine years?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A great difference between this case and the preceding
one is that the extension here is for 999 years,
sueli being the period for which it was provîded that Parliament miglit validate the
agreement, if it desired so to, do at any time
within twenty-one years after the agreement
was made. I understand the Minister of
Justice lias expressed the view that we cannot
do otherwise than ratify or fail to ratify the
agreement, and that if ratified it must be for
999 years-which is merely another way of
saying for a permanent term.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: That is the limit
for the emphyteutic lease.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend will be the oniy one of us alive
then.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Campheliford, Lake Ontario and Western Raiiway
may bic unknown to many honourable mcmbers, but it is reaily the Campbell'ford line
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway. When the
Canadian Pacific wished to get a second road
t.hrough from the east to Toronto it did not
double-track, but built a line across from its
main uine, reaching the frontier at Belleville.
The agreement referred to in this Bill is
really between the Canadian National Railways and the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why is the name o>f
this Campbiellford railiway used here? Was
there a company in existence before the
Canadian Pacifie Railway took over the line?
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No; I think
the Canadian Pacifie huiit this line under
the name designated here. But I am speaking only from memory as to that.

Tliero lias lx on machi discussion as t o the
effeet of the inceasing bierd of seals on oar
Pacifie Coaat fishi, particularly the saliion.
The Department of Fishierios is of the opinion
that the inereasing herd lias no serious effect.
It is elaimed that the seals live largely on
squid and fish of tbat kind. 0f course, if the
seal bas not the taste for good fisli, it is
.Iast possible that lie would flot bother witb
aur salmaut.
Bat after i eadiug tlîe repurt
of the Biological Socety I should say that
saliiion eo0nsttitiie 25 per cent of the food of
scals. 1 do flot think wo can doubt that
1,300,000 scals swiniring tip our- coast mnust
consumo large quantities of fish destined for
aur rivors. It is said that in the sixties
and seventies the bord ivas voiT machi larger,
about 4,700,000 seals, and tîtat tlioro was
plenty of fisli thoen. But at that time there
ivas no0 commaercial fishing, and it iiiay bc that

determined to whiat extent the seals do interfore with our flsb, but ane thing is certain.
tliat oar nortbern fishieries are shrinking, for
causes unknown to the authorities. It would
be difflealt ta exaggerate the quantity of fish
that sucb a vast berd of seals might consume.
But for the fact that they are killed off
by the authorities; the sea lions (similar to,
but more destructive than our seals) on aur
coast would, I believe, exterminate aIl our
flsb in the course of ten years. We destroy
about 1,500 sea lions a year, and in that way
keep the numbers down.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Is the pelt of tbe

Hon. Mr. McRAE:
No. The sea lions
are shot on the rocks and faîl
the sea,
and there is noa way of saving them. The
pelts would not be of any use, and the
carcass is flot large enough to trouble with
for reducing purposes, as it is too bard to
handle.
Now I corne ta the third point ta wbich the
honourable senator from, New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Taylor) referred ut considerable
length, our sockeye salmon fisliery. In 1930
Parliament approv'ed a treaty with tbe United

mbt

MARCH 20, 1934
States covering the sockeye salmon of the
Fraser river. That treaty has nlot yet received
approval at Washington. By it the United
States recognized for the first time, in part
at least, the right of this country in the
sockeye salmon of the Fraser river. It proviided for an equal distribution of the fish
between the two countries.
A situation the opposite to that of the
scals exists with respect to the sockeye salmon
of the Fraser river. The seal herd, which.
breeds entirely in United States territory,
passes our shores on the way to the breeding
grounds. Under the Sealing Treaty between
Canada and the United States we agreed that
our nationýals sho-uld flot hunt seals upon the
highi seas, but this prohibition was flot to
apply to the Indians of British Columbia.
With this exception we agreed to give the
seal herd absolute protection in its passage
along our coast. In fulfilment of our part of
the treaty, essential to the existence of the
herd, w-e have forced our fishermen to discontinue seat hunting, and we rigidly prosecute
any infraction of the regulation; we prosecute
even an Indian who shoots seals, he being
allowed under the treaty to kili them only
with a spear.
The sockeye salmon breed and propagate
in the Fraser river, entirely within Canadi.an
territory. During the first year they remain
in the river, then proceed to sea, for three
vears. These foolish fish, on their return from
the sea, circle around Puget Sound, where
two-thirds of them are caught in American
traps. The other third get through to Canadian waters, where a f ew more are caught,
and the remainder go up the Fraser river to
spawn and propagate their kind.
Who pays for the upkeep of the Fraser
river sockeye saîmon fishery? On reference
to the records I find that in the last twenty
years the Dominion Goverument has approprîited $11,260,0OI0 for fish protection and
development in my province, and it bas
collected by way of revenue from dues and
licences some 32,900,000-but nothing from
the Ujnited States-the net outlay being
approximateIy $8,2W0,000. It would be fair
to say that abouit half of this money bas been
spent on the Fraser river and its watershed.
In other wiyrds, during *the last twenty years
we have spent more than $4,000,000 over and
above what we received in revenue. The
Americans haveéfnot paid a single cent. For
whose benefit bas the expenditure been made?
The records show that t.he Americans, with
their modern equipment, have caught twothirds of the fish, and only one-'third bas
been caught by Canadian fishermen.

171

May I digress a moment to describe briefly
The
the different methods of fishing?
Americans are using the most modern equipment in the world, that is, the seine and the
trap. In certain respects we have the same
equipment, bu~t to a large extent we debar
its use for sockeye salmon fishing. 1 have
Iooked over the fishing equipment in the
Eastern and Southern States and have seen
notbing approaching the modern methods of
fishing in vogue on our western coast. The
seines used to be haif a mile long; to-day the
Arnericans use seines a mile long. This is
a very effective and economical method of
fishing, but still more er-onomnical is the trap.
By the use of traps the Americans catch most
of the sockeye salmon before they get into
our brackish water. In contrast with this
modern equipment we use gi nets--about
the same equipment as was used on the Sea
of ýGalilce two 'thousand years ago. This is
not an economical method of flshing.
Right here and now I express my entire
accord with the honourable member from
New Westminster that we must not disturb
our fishermen at this time-we must allow
them to continue to gain their livelihood for
the present. But I suhmit, honourable mcmbers, we are ages behind the times in our fisbing industry. Twelve thousand men are engaged in British Columbia fishing to-day.
These men at best make a very precarious
living. Two tbousand men could do the work
with modern flshing methods. When economie conditions approach normal and the
other 10,000 men can be absorbed into other
branches of labour we should modernize ouT
flshing regulations to permit the use of modemn
equipment. You cannot hold back progress
in fishing any more than you can in any other
branch of industry. Once the industry is put
on a modern basis it will become scîf-sustaining. I may be asked wby it bas flot already
been put on that basis. I reply, because for
the last twenty years it bas been the football
of politicians, quite regardless of the party
that bas been in power.
As I have pointed out, during the past
twenty years we have expended $8,000,000 for
the propagation and protection of the Fraser
river flshery. To what end? To provide twothirds of the fish for the fishermen of the
United States. I submit, honourable members, that as a quid pro quo we should ask
Washington to, approve the Sockeye Salmon
Treaty which, as I have said, has already been
approved by this Parliament. Under that
proposed treaty the United States would get
haîf the sockeye salmon from the Fraser river
and pay one-haif the expense. Failing this,

Before concluding mv remarks I dcsire te
refer te the Biological Board. Its appropriation roughly is about $250,000 a vear, and
about haîf of that sum is expendedl on the
Pacifie coast. My ohservations lead me to
believe that the Board miglit hetter direct its
efforts to accomplishi more practical work than
it is doing at the present time. I have in
mind what bas been donc at Jasper Park,

tlîat we bave neyer made anytbing like a

Tbe fishing induistry is vcry important to
Canada. Last ycar the catch represented a
value of $26,000,000. In the heyday of prices,
in 1929 and 1930, the total value ran from
850,000,000 te S55,000,000. 1 arn confident
that the industry is capable of much greater

ing of the seal at sea. This had deleterious
results, inasmuch as no discrimination was
made between the male and the female. Indeed, the practical result was to handicap the
females in the race for life, because they were
more easily caught, being slower to return
than the males, whieh were always many days
ahead. The consequence of large numbers
of the victims being females was a diminution
of the herd. What applies to the American
herd applies similarly to the Japanese herd,
whose
objective
is Robben Island,
in
Japanese territory-formerly it was Russianand also to the Russian herd, whose breeding
grounds arc in the Commander Islands in the
Bering Sea. While these herds are closely
related biologically, they are three distinct
herds, the first coming under the jurisdiction
of Russia, the second under tit
of Japan,
and the third under that of the United States,
by reason of their breeding grounds being in
the territories of those countries. Canada's
interest, therefore, was in pelagic sealing
alone, a most destructive methbod of catching
the seai, and one whieh in the general interest
should be curtailendand indeed abndonecd.
As a result of the pelagic sealing the scals,
which formerly numbered 4,700,000, were reduced to only 133,000 in the year 1910, when
our share, c, I understand it, was 2,600. It
became evident, therefore, that unless something were donec the herd would disappear
entirely and the indc
iustr v would he no more.
The Paris Award, in connection with which
Sir Hibbert Tupper took a prominent part,
was reached in 1894. Fnder this award, whieh
largely gave effect to a modus vivendi in
operation since 1890, the seals in the territory
within a radius of sixty miles of the breeding
grounds were protected, and the months of
May, June and July were established as a
closed season. These regulations, however,
did net apply to Japan and Russia; consequently Japanese and Russians invaded the
territory which the Canadians and the
Americans, felt to be their own, and had
made forbidden ground.
This invasion
resulted in the destruction of many seals
and almost in the elimination of the industry
itself.

In 1911, after prolonged negotiations, a
treaty was finally consummated, a very distinguisied member of this House, the honourable member from North York (Hon. Sir
Allen Aylesworth) taking an eminent part.
That treaty, known as the quadripartite
treaty, the parties being Great Britain, the
United States, Russia and Japan, is the one
under whieh we operate to-day, and under
which the results referred te by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIHEN.

Mr. Taylor) and the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) were attained.
It went into effect for a period of fifteen
years, and was to remain in operation until
abrogated upon one years notice by any one
of the parties. It contained the reservation,
however, that upon notice of abrogation being
given there should be a convention of the
participating nations for the purpose of substituting another treaty in its stead. As no
such notice las been given, the treaty is
still in effect.
Under this treaty pelagic sealing is no
more; it is forbidden to catch seals in the
water; and since the year 1911 the sealers
of Russia have lad to confine their efforts to
the Commander Islands, the sealers of Japan
to Robben Island, and those of the United
States to the Pribilof Islands. These nations
have also becen able to restrict the efforts of
their hunters to the males, and, no doubt,
to limit the numbers caught, witl a consequent multiplication of the animals te the
extent already referred te.
Whereas there
were only 133,000 in 1910, there were 1.219,000
In 1932, and, according to the figures of the
honourable senator from Vancouver, in 1933
there were 1,300,000 odd seals. The increase
is now about 100,000 per year or a little more,
which is equal te the catch in the heyday of
the sealing industry, when there were 700.000
seals inhabiting the waters of the Pacifie.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: How do ther make
the census?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The sals. are
all to be found on these islands, and within
a comparatively limited area. I presumce the
nations concerned insist upon a census each
year, and the trcaty provides that suci a
census shall be kept. The results from the
standpoint of the herd have been so excellent
that it has now reached proportions net far
removed from those of pristine times.
But, it is said, Canada does not derive
very much benefit. I am net so sure that
Canada is entitled to a great deal. Canada
gets fifteen per cent of the pelts taken on
the Pribilof Islands, fifteen per cent of those
taken on the Russian islands, and ten per
cent of those taken on the Japanese islands.
My information is that Russia stopped counting in 1925, and that since then we have net
been able to get any information as to what
is happening with respect to that country.
I mention this for the information of those
who are really desirous of our establishing
more intimate relations with Russia. Russia
simply stepped out of the picture some eight
years ago.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And we have had:
none since then?

17Î~

MARCHI 20, 1934
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: We have had
none since then. We do get, I think, about
170 peits per year from Japan, and the number t-hat we received in the depieted years
of the industry from the United States bas
now increased, so that our fifteen per cent of
the American catch represented 8,18.3, I think,
in 1933. Therefore it was certainly far better
for Canada that the treaty conditions shouid
be put into effect than that there shouid be
a graduai eimination of the whoie herd, as
would have happened -had there been no treaty
at ail. It is true that for many years we
received very littie from the peits taken.

The honourabie senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) states, and quite rightiy,
that although we are entitled to take our
fifteen per cent on these islands we actuaiiy
have not donc so. I am acivisprl that the expense of rnaintaining faci'iities and an organization on the islands is the reason. These
facilities wouid have to be there long before the appearance of the seais, and wouid
have to remain for some time afterwards.
Aithough it is not specificaily dcsignated in
the treaty, a plan was arrived at by mutuai
arrangement, under which the Americans took
the seals to a company in St. Louis, where
they were dresscd and tanned and piaced
upon the market, Canada getting fifteen per
cent of the proceeds.

I might 'have mentioned that aftcr the
treaty took effect in 19111 Russia, Japan, Great
Britain and the United States, by mutuai arrangement, refrained entircly from hunting the
scals for a period of five years, and that it
was not until the expiration of that time that
the actual terms of the treaty were impiemented by action. It was during that period
that the Americans conceived the ide-a of substituting an American market for the old
market in London, and established a company
in St. Louis. For a time, during the high
prices of the war period, St. Louis was the
greatest fur market in the worid. The Canadian Government, iiowcver, bas been cooperating with the market authorities of London with a view to restoring to some degree
the importance of that centre. As a consequence our seals were sold there in 103M, and
at very satisfactory prices, and it is hoped
that henceforth, so f ar as Canada's share iS
concerned, we shall get better resuits through
London than we have been obtaining through
St. Louis.
Such is the htistory of the sealing industry
on the Pacifie. It is not a tragic history. It
is a history of 'beneficent arrangements made
between friendiy countries for their mutuai.
advantage; and did it stand alone it would
not seemn to me to be open to very serious

attack. The conftention, though, of the senators who have spoken, which has been
strongiy urged by the honourable gentleman
who has just sat down (Hon. Mr. McRae),
is that the principie appiied by the Pelagic
Seaiing Treaty of 1911, nameiy, that the
primiacy of right to control the whole industry belongs to the country which owns the
breeding grounds, has unfortunýateiy flot been
applied in the case of saimon. If it had been
so appiied, Canada, because of its ownership
of the saimon breeding grounds, wouid be first
in Uine for the harvest, instead of the United
States, which appears to reap two-thirds of
that barvest at the present time.
Ail I need say now is that if when the
debate is over it seems that there is a suffi-

cient object to be served by a committee, 1

On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the debate

THE WORK OF TUE SENATE
INQUIRY DISCUSSION

CONTINUEIY

The Senate resumed from March 14 consideration of the question proposed by Hon.
Mr. Murphy:
To eall the attention of the Governmnent to
the work of the Senate and to, the efforts niade
by the Senate to secure the initiation in this
bouse of Government measores, and to inquire
if it is the intention of the Government to

Honourable
bon. W. A. BIJCHANAN:
senators, when the honourable gentleman from
Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy) introdiiced this
discussion neariy three weeks ago, he gave
notice that he wouid cail the attention of the
Government to the work of the Senate. In
the meantime we have been hearing consider-

able about this subjeet, and I am convinced
that the attention not oniy of the Government but of the whole country has been cailed
to the work of the Senste. The newspaperis
have been severely criticized, for the insufficient publicity they give to this Chamber and
its commnittees, but on iooking through newspapers in the iast ten days or so I have f ound
that 'this discussion bas been fairly weil reported and bas been the subject of editoriai

ing to me, because they came from sources
which I had always looked upon as being
critical of this body. The arguments and
facts presented by the honourable senator
from Russell seem to have convinced the
writers of those articles that the Senate has
real merit, and that it has made a considerable contribution towards safeguarding the
treasury of this country ever since Confederation.
I think this debate has been useful if for
no other reason than that it bas enligbtened
the country. I am going to confess that it
bas also enlightened myself, one of the comparatively new members of this House, and
it bas strengthened my feeling that the Senate
is an institution which renders valuable services to this country. I will touch briefly on
one or two points along that line of thought.
This discussion was introduced by a speech
with a twofold purpose: to call attention to
what the Senate had done in the past, and to
inquire as to what might be donc witb a view
to making it in the future a more useful
branch of our parliamentary system. Under
the first heading, with regard to what bas
been donc, the honourable senator from
Russell made clear that by reason of the
Senate's action on money bills which had
been sent over from the other House, some
$100,000,000 had been saved to the national
treasury. I want to stress one money-saving
action which was not included in the list presented by the honourable senator from Russell,
but which has already been mentioned by the
honourable gentlemen froin West Central
Saskatchewan
(Hon.
Mr. Aseltine)
and
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans). J refer to
the contribution to the pockets of the farmers
in Western Canada as a result of vhat was
done here with the Crowsnest Pass agreement
in respect to rates on flour and wheat.
If there is any part of Canada where the
Senate is strongly criticized, it is the West;
and if there is any element in the West which
is particularly strong in that criticism, it is
the element known as organized farmers. I
do net think tbey have realized the fact that
the present Crowsnest Pass rates might not
have been in existence had it not been for the
protection afforded by this House back in
1919, and I think this discussion will reveal
to them the great benefits they received from
what was donc here then. My present object
is to emphasize the importance of that matter,
though I am not going into any details at the
moment. There is no question that a large
sum-it could easily be $25,000,000, as estimated-was indirectly transferred to the
pockets of the farmers of Western Canada
because of the safeguarding in that agreement
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

of the preferential rates on wheat and flour.
So the Senate has protected not only the
treasury of Canada, but also the producers
of the West.
Mucb of the criticism against the Senate
bas been made by people who are not familiar
with the history of this Chamber and the
way in which it has dealt with a large number
of important measures that have come before
it for consideration. Many critics probably
formed their unfavourable opinions when
some measures towards which they were
sympathetic were defeated here. It is not
generally appreciated that the Senate can and
often does take a position hostile to what are
commonly called the vested interests of Canada. If there is one insinuation more frequently made than any other, it is that this
body is largely composed of mon who are in
sympathy with the vested interests, the large
corporations. It is charged that senators are,
as a whole, reactionaries. If that charge had
been truc when the Crowsnest Pass agreement
came up for consideration, the provision for
preferential rates on wheat and flour would
have been wiped out, which is undoubtedly
what the railroads would have liked to
happen. But the Senate stepped in and took
a position contrary to the views of the railroad corporations, and saved these rates. I
am participating in this debate largely because of my desire to emphasize the value
of the assistance then given to Western
Canada producers through the protection of
those rates and the maintenance of an agreement that had come into existence bock in
the year 1897.
And I submit to honourable members that
the savings effected by the Senate cannot be
fully measured by the cost of various projects
as estimated in the bills rejected here. There
bas been a reference to the proposal made
during the period of the Klondike excitement
to build a railroad frem White Pass to
Dawson City. I am not quite familiar with
the suggested route, but at any rate a bill
was sent over from the other House providing
for the construction of a railroad to serve the
Klondike goldfields, and that measure was
thrown out by the Senate. I was surprised
to note, in the speech of the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans),
that the late Sir Clifford Sifton was quoted
as saying he had not known a case in which
a Government was desirous of going to the
people on a bill rejected by the Senate. My

country than we need, and that we should
only aggravate the situation by encouraging
settlers to come in from other lands. On
the other hand, certain persons feel that
our transportation problem can be solved only
by bringing more settlers into the country.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Might we not bave
an inquiry with respect to immigration? The
inquiry need not involve much expense. By
bringing before the proposed committee Government officials and others who have interested themselves particularly in matters of
unemployment and immigration, we might
secure information that would bc useful to
Parliament and to the country at large.
The honourable member from Russell
(Hon. Mr. Murphy) also addressed himself to
the question of what could be done to provide more work for the Senate. He covered
this pretty fully, as did also my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and the right
honourable leader of the House (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen). Since they took part in the
debate I notice a number of bills have reached
us from the other House, of the nature of
what I might call departmental, or non-contentious legislation.
The suggestion that ministers sitting in the
other Chamber should be invited to attend
this House and explain measures in which
they are interested appeals to me very
strongly, particularly in respect to non-contentious legislation. The country becomes
tired of the prolonged debates in the other
House on the Address and the Budget and is
eager to see the legislative business of the
session expedited. The adoption of the suggestion would promote this end. I agree with
those who think that it would be most unwise
to introduce contentious legislation in this
House, but there can be no valid objection
to departmental legislation being initiated
here. I find that in several countries of
Europe it is the practice for ministers to go
from one Chamber to the other to deal with
legislation in mucli the same way as has been
proposed during this debate.
Undoubtedly the right honourable leader of
the House has introduced some very important legislation in this Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: If I have any
criticism to direct towards the press-which,
of course, would be directed also towards myself-it would be that the proceedings before
the standing committees of the Senate are not
as fully reported as they should be. For instance, such important measures as the
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

Shipping Bill, the Railway Bill and the Insurance Bill now before the Bank and 'Commerce Committee are of great public importance and should be given adequate space by
the press.
Too often there appears in the newspapers
the laconic line, "The Senate did not sit today." It is in the hope of providing more
work for the Senate, and so convincing the
public that it is really a constructive branch
of Parliament, that I make these suggestions.
Those of us who come from Western Canada,
and have to remain here during the entire
session, probably get somewhat more restless
than those of our colleagues who live within
easy reach of the Capital. We from the West
should like to be busy every day in the week.
I do not wish to imply that this Chamber is
not doing all that it should do. Under present conditions it is expediting the sessional
business far more effectively than the other
Chamber. There is no waste of time in the
Senate. But I feel that if the rules of both
Houses were amended in relation to the introduction of legislation here, we should have
more work to do and in this way the session
would be shortened.
With respect to the suggestions made for
the reform of the Senate, there is a tendency
on the part of the public to regard us as a
body of very old men who have long passed
our period of usefulness. I may have shared
that view before I entered this Chamber, and
I want to make this confession. Since my
appointment J have come to the conclusion
that some of the very ablest members of this
Senate are men well advanced in years. An
outstanding example was the honourable
gentleman who formerly sat in front of me,
the late Senator Béique. To me it was
always most inspiring to watch his keen
analysis of the bills under discussion, his
unerring judgment in directing attention to
any flaws of draftsmanship, and his helpful
suggestions by way of amendment. He was
nearly ninety years of age at the time of
his death. I am not a lawyer, but I believe
his was one of the brightest and keenest
legal minds in the Senate, indeed in the country at large. I see before me other senior
members who I feel are rendering very useful service to their country. Therefore I am
not in sympathy with the proposal that
senators should retire on reaching a certain
age.
Should a change in the constitution of the
Senate be a subject for consideration at
some future date, 'I would suggest that something might be done to better balance the
representation of political views in our mem-

bership, and so broaden its appeal to the
country at large. Ini making this suggestion
I ar n ot con.cerned with the political fortunes of the party with which I have been
idtntifiedý. No matter wh.ich party is in
power, there is a tendency for its representatien in the Senate -te become overbalanced,
to the exclusion of representation of other
political elements. I would suggest that instead of the ad-mission of clerics te the Senate,
the provincial governments be allowed te
nominate a certain proportion of the mcmbership, say a third. I make that suggestion
for the reason that, se far as I know, there is
no representation ini this Chamber of extreme
radicalism, and because it is sometimes
charged that the Senate lacks progressive
and advanced opinion. If during the last
ten years the Goverciment of Aiberta, for
instance, had had an epportunity to nommnate memibers, there would be to-day at
least two senators from the United Farmer
party, andi I do net think the Senate would
be the worse for their preoence. We sheuld
have the advantage of hearing their views
at first hand, and of drawing attention to any
unsoundness in those vie'ws. The representatien of radical elements ici this Cham-ber
would presumably help us in our deliberations
and impreve our standing in the estimation of
the ceuntry.
1 wish to add my 'tribute te those already
paid te the honourable senater from, Russell
(Hon. Mr. Murphy). He delivered what te
me was a most comprehensive address on the
purpese and functione of the Senate. I feel
certain that what he has said wîil enlighten
the public and remove any lingering doubts
as te the useful*ness of this Chamber, its
eagerness te do aIl the work that can be
presented te it, and its 'being ever on guard

interests of the whole Dominion.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:

senaters, I desire te make but a few brief
remarks on the elequent and impressive

The henourable member whe lia8 just taken

important legislation introduced ini this House
during the past two sessions. One of the most
important bills ever placed before Parliament,

Huse. Fer seme six weeks it was very caref ully considered by the Standing Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours and
practically redrafted. The right honeurable
leader of the bouse (Riglit Hon. Mr.
Meighen) and every other member of the
Committee brought te bear their legal skill
and practical experience te sucbh goed purpose
that when the Bill reached the other Heuse
little if any change was made in it. Last
session the right honourable leader introduced
the fShipping Bill, the largest bill I have ever
seen. This session we have had twe very
important insurance buis and the Admiralty
Bill under consideration. 1 stress the fact of
the introduction of these bills in this House
because of an interview that I had a short
time age with a very important business man
in the city of Montreal. He said ta me:
"Senator, how d-id it happen that the Railway
Bill was intreduced first in the Senate? I
was always under the impression thiat ahl bills
had te be intreduced ici the bouse of Cernmens first, and were allewed te percolate te
the Senate afterwards?" Now, if we have
donc nething more than inform, the publie
that legîslation can he and is inîtiated ici this
House, we have -certainly acconiplished a
great deal.
Like several other senaters, I had some
years' experience ici the other bouse, and I
have reached (the conclusion that if we are
net as centinuously active as they are ici
another place, it is due to difference of procedure rather than te anything else. By way
of illustration allow me te refer te the passage
of the Raihway Bill ici the Gommons last
session. The Minister of Ra-ilways on first
reading made a few explanatory remarks; on
second reading the principle of the bill was
debated for several days; then it was referred
te the Standing Committee on Railways,
CanaIs and Telegraph Lines; after being discussed there fer some tîme it was reported
-te the House for consideration ici Committee of the Whole; this consîderatien extended over several days, and even on the
motion for third reading, Il think, there was
further debate. Compare that slow precedure
with what happened ini this Chamber. On
the first reading the twe leaders dealt with
the Bill very briefly; on being given second
reading it was referred te the Standing Cemmittee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours,
where it was dealt with effectively and expeditiously.
I do net wish te make any invidieus cernparisons, but I suhrnit that the committee
work of Vhis bouse is vastly superior te the
commîttee work of the other bouse. After
any of our standing committees has con-

SENATE
sidered a bill, only a very short time is
devoted to it in Committee of the Whole.
My point is that this House can do its legislative work in half the time taken by the
other House, and do it more effectively. A
striking instance of this is te be found in the
debate on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. We pass the Address after
a three-hour debate; in the other Bouse the
debate lasts three weeks and sometimes longer.
The reason is obvious: honourable senators
are appointed for life; members of the other
House are elected by popular vote.
I am not in agreement with the honourable
senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan)
that the provincial governments should be
granted the right to nominate senators. I
believe this House was constituted for the purpose of safeguarding not only minority and
provincial rights, but also the rights of all
the people of Canada. The Senate has never
failed to discharge that duty in the most
creditable and thorough manner, and I for
one should not like to sec any change made in
the manner of appointment to this honourable flouse. If inembers were te bc elected
by popular vote, instead of the sma-l, anaemic
Hansard that we read cach morning, we should
be confronted with a voluminous report of our
proccedings; in a word, we should soon find
ourselves pretty much on the same basis as
the other House.
I agree with the honourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Alyesworth) that
all private bills should be introduced here, and
I sincerely hope that whatever Government
is in power will take steps to bring this about.
I think it would be only fair for us te express
our gratification te the present Government
for handing over to this House the important
legislation to which I have referred.
Before resuming my seat, I may be permitted to say that the Senate and the
country are to bc congratulated upon the
fact that we have here, in the person of our
leader (Right Hon. Mir. Meighen), such an
experienced parliaenntarian, a man with such
an analytical mind and so extraordinarily
qualified in every way to occupy his important position.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I sec opposite
me the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), the dean of the
Senate, a man rich in parliamentary experience, and seated next to him the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham), te refer to no others. In view
of the ability of our leader on this side, and
on the other side the experience that only
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

mature years can bring, I do not see that
the Senate of Canada bas need to apologize
to anyone for the work it has done in the
past, or is doing now, or will be called upon
te do in the future. Let me repeat that I
do net want to see any change in the method
of appointing members of this Chamber. I
am opposed to the summoning of clerics, and
I certainly do not want to hear any radical
views expressed in this House.
We have
ieard enough of such views in the other
House, and we read enough of them in the
press to satisfy us all.
I am very glad tlat the honourable senator
frem Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy) lias brought
this subject before us, and I thank honourable gentlemen for the kind attention with
which they have listened to my remarks.

LEAGUE OF NATIONS
NOTICE 0F MOTION FOR CANADA'S
WITHDRAWAL

Hon. A. D. McRAE gave notice of the
following motion:
That on Tuesday, April 17, he will move:
That this House is of the opinion that
Canada should withdraw froma membership in
the League of Nations and that no further
money should be voted te the League.
Hie said: In explanation of this notice of
motion may I say that the failure of the
League of Nations to attain the object for
which it was founded, namely, world peace, is
now generally recognized. The present deplorable preparations for war throughout the
world are disturbing to every lover of peace.
The responsibîlity that may rest on Canada,
as a inember of the League, to take part in
future wars, if this country should participate
in negotiations immediately preceding the outbreak of another world war, is a matter of
concern to every Canadian. In these difficult
times, when we must conserve every dollar of
our resources, the annual payments to the
LeagueHon. Mr. MURDOÇK: Honourable members, my understanding is that the rules of
the flouse provide that a speech should not
be made on the giving of a notice of motion.
Hlon. Mr. McRAE: It is not a speech, but
an explanation.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAjM: Which some
speeches are not.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rise to a point of
order, and I should like the point settled,' if
y-ou please, Mr. Speaker. I do not sec any
distinction between a speech and an explanation.
Hlon. Mr. McRA±E: If the honouarable gentleman will hear me through, he will, I think,
agree that it is only an explanation. I ama
explaining why I am giving this notice so far
in advance of the date when I intend ta make
the motion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I still insist that
the honourable gentleman is out of order in
the explanation he is making.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Strictly speaking, the point of order is well taken, but my
information is that it is the practice for the

181

Sena>te to allow short explanatory remarks
when a notice of motion is given. Unless
it is the unanimous wish of the Senate that
the honourable gentleman froma Vancouver be
permitted to go on with his explanation-if
the honourable member from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) insists on his point of order,
I shall have to maintain it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I respectfully insist that nothing but the honourable gentleman's notice of motion should be included
in the record.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
speaking to the point of order, I should like
to have a statement from the honourable
leader of the other aide of the flouse (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) as to what has been the
practice in this Chamber. Ever since I have
been here, an explanation like that being
made now bas been perrnitted. The explanation is for the benefit of every member, s0
that he may know what is going to be moved,
and why.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
1 am afraid this discussion is much ado about
nothing. I have read ail that I intended to
read, except a couple of sentences, which, if
they are flot acceptable, need flot be placed
on the record. I was saying that in these
difficult times, when we muet conserve every
dollar of our resources, the annual payments
to the League, which now total millions of
dollars, .are of serious moment. For these
reasons, I feel my proposed motion merits
the careful consideration of this honourable
flouse.
I now come to the final reason why I give
notice of this motion so far in advance. I
do so in order that honourable members may
have ample opportunity to consider this imaportant matterHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators. I still insist that the ruIes of the flouse

(Hon. Mr. Calder) what the practice bas been

lengthy explanation bas ever been given on

beyond a phrase or two, it might caîl for an
answer, and one could not be given, since
no debate is permissible on a notice of
motion. Bo a notice of motion is generally
given without any explanation, and the debate
takes place when the motion is made.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I should like to ask a question of the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). Has he any objection to my explainng, some three weeks in advance, why I
intend to make my motion?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sonally raise any objection.

I did not per-

Hon. Mr. McRAE: No. My question was
directed to the honourable gentleman from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). I should like
honourable senators to know that this advance
notice is given so that honourable members
may have ample opportunity to consider this
important matter, and in the hope that we
may have a full debate on it when the House
reconvenes after Easter.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I hope that His Honour the Speaker
will instruct that everything that the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) has said, after he gave his notice of
motion, is to be expunged from the record,
as having been presented contrary to the rules
of the House.
Sone Hon. SENATORS: No.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: This places me
in a difficult position. On referring to the
rules of the House I find that rule No. 21
provides:
Wlien a senator wishes to give notice of an
inquiry or motion, he reduces the notice to
writing, signs it, reads it from his place during
a sitting of the Senate, and hands it in at the
Clerk's table.
This rule does not apply to motions with

respeet to Bills, nor to motions dealing with
reports of committees, nor to formal, routine,
subsidiary or incidental motions, notice of
which, wlen necessary, may be given by word
of mouth, or by any mieans which places such
motions among the Orders or on the notice
paper for any day.
I can find no rule definitely stating that a
speech is not allowed on the giving of notice
of motion, but this is to be inferred from
rule 21. However, as I have previously said,
I am informed that the practice of the Senate
has been to allow an explanation whenever it
seems that one would conduce to a better

understanding of the purpose of the proposed
motion.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Permission to
speak must be given unanimously, though.
Honourable senators, I am out of order-I
admit it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, sit down!
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does not this
bring us to the point from which we should
never have departed-observance of the rules
of the House? We complain a good deal about
the short time we are in session. Well, there
is a certain routine through which all bills
should go, but we suspend the rules as a
matter of course. I have come to the conclusion-and what has just happened has
brought it more forcibly to my mind-that
we could spend our time very profitably if we
observed the rules of the House. For instance,
when a bill requires a couple of days' notice,
let us insist on that notice.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is all very
well, but the right honourable gentleman
should practise what he preaches. He says
he himself is out of order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point out
that the Speaker is under a handicap in that
he is not supposed to intervene, even if a
rule is broken, unless some honourable senator
calls his attention to the breach. Thus it
comes about that sometimes an honourable
senator, although lie may be out of order, is
allowed to address the House, but a little later
another honourable memiber for a breach of
the same rule may be called to order. It
seems to me it would be well for the House
to reconsider the rule which prevents the
Speaker from taking the initiative, except in
extreme cases.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I do not think we can adopt the
practice of insisting on notice in every case,
because to do so would involve inconveniences
not paid for by the result. I quite agree that
the rules should be followed all the time. Any
rule can be suspended by unanimous consent. In this respect we are following the
practice of all parliaments. But when there
is a valid objection to the violation of a
rule, it is only right that the rule should be
immediately enforced. However, I do not
think enforcement should go to the length of
having prior discussion expunged from the
record. That discussion, even though it be
contrary to the rule, is part of the record,
as is the debate upon the point of order.
It seems to me the right practice is to require
unanimous consent for suspension of any
rule. The rules of the House are for the protection of all members, and any individual
member has the right to insist on their enforcement at all times. In the present case
I think the enforcement can go no further
than it has already gone.

that the passenger train pooling arranged for

March 11, will produce a total saving of
approximately 1,000,000 train miles per annum,
divided approximately evenly between the two
companies, and, on the basis of a conservative
estimate, will represent a saving to each company of approxiinately $500,000 per annum.

cases employees displaced by pooling arrangemnt will retain employment by exercising
seniority riglits to other positions, resulting in
junior employees being returned to freight
service. With the improvement in trafflc, Mr.
Fullerton states that the management is convinced that after the extension of pooling, as
arranged for, is in effeet, there will be more
men in actual employment than at the time
the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act,
1933, became effective, and that with continued
improvement in traffic, there will not be any
increased unemployment but rather the contrary. Arrangements as made for the pooling
of passenger train services were adopted only
after careful consideration of ail the conditions involved, so as to effect economies by
avoiding duplication of train services and stili
maintain, with as little disturbance as possible,
adequate service to, the publie.
In regard to the statement as to dispiacement of ail Canadian National services between
Montreal and Quebec, the Canadian National
Railway operntes, and will continue to operate,
between Montreal and Levis, the Ocean Limited
and Maritime Express, two trains in each
direction daily, and has arranged to proyide
another train between Charny and the Palais
station at Quebec connecting with the Maritime Express to and from Montreal.
Mr. Fullerton points out in this telegram
that hie bas conferred with the Canadian
Pacifie, and that this statement which I have
just read is a joint statement of the twa
companies.
May I add that I arn advised that 80 per
cent of ail passenger traffie between Montreal
and Quebec bas always been carried by the
Canadian Pacifie railway, as it is an older line
and passes through more of the settled communities on the north shore.
May I add as well that in the pooling of
passenger trains, the economies and tbe profits,
if any. are split equally between the two railway coinpanies. In this regard it may be wel
to point out that nccording to an official statement, whieh 1 hold in xny hand, the increase
in groas revenue, for the first two months of
this year, as conipared with 19331, for the
Canadian National and Canadian Pacifie railways together, lias been $6,700,000,' of which
$3,900,000 increase lias gone to the Canadian
National Railways, and Î2,800,000 to the Canadian Pacifie Railway. I mention tbis in reply
to suggestions, %vhich are sometîmes made, that
in agreements between the two companies the
Canadian National Railways is getting an
unfair deal.

apparently the mnanagement of the Canadian
National Railways is looking after the interests
of the Canadian National quite capably, and I
have no doubt that the arrangements made
between the Canadian National and Canadian
Pacifie railway officiaIs are made on a fair and
equitable basis to both companies.
In regard to the inquiry of tbe bon. member
for Bow River (Mr. Garland) as to train
service between Ottawa and Toronto, I have
made inquiries and arn informed that while
some changes have been made in the time of

SENATE

lion. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of the inquiry of whicb I
have given notice is to eall the attention of
this bonourabie House te a very serious situation,
namely,
that to-day
competitien
between our two great railway systems is
just as keen as it was before the passage
of the Railway Bill last session, and that
there seems te be ne way of getting the
officiais of the two railways te remedy this
undesirable condition.
It wvill be witbin the rocollectien ef honeurable members that lest session, pending the
ceming inte for-ce of the Railway Act based
on the report of the Duif Commission, we
passod unanimously a motion rocommending
that a certain number cf Canadian Pacifie
and Canadian National officiais should confer
with a view te arranging further economies
in the eperation cf tbcir respective railwvays.
As I bcd sometbing te do with that motion,
1 mado it my business te see the Canadian
Pacific officiais, witb soe oral of wbom I am
on intimate termis. Wben I used te speak
ngainst the extravagant building of linos ie
the Norîbhwest. the Lie Senator Turiff would
exclaim bY way cf roproch, "XVe have heard
fromt a C.P.R. man."~ I did net thon, nor
cOe I now, think it a di-erace te be a fî-iend
et the Canadien Pacifie Railway. It is one
of the groatcst transportation systems in the
world, and ne cempany since Confodoration
bas done so much te dcx elop this country as
bas tbc Canadien Patci'ic Railway Company.
As I say, 1 xvont te certain officiais cf the
Canadien Pacifie Company. I put before them
a ûoncrete case that I bcad bcad the bonour
cf bringing te the attention of this House.
Tbey would net (Ie anything. Tlhon I wcnt
te the Canadien N',ational Railways and Mr.
Fraser, their ebief counisel, said te me, "Oh, it
i, up te the C.P.R. te propose that." Se
between tho twe sets cf officiais nothing came
of niy proposai. Later I inquired frem time
te time of tbc officiais cf botlb roads, "Are
a-nu getting togethor and dcoing scmctlbing?'
Theo'v replied, "01b, vos, we arc doing a lot.'"
But I cculd nover fuîd eut wliat they avere
actnally doing. I have e slogan with respect
te the railway situation cf Canada: one
railrecd is a nevessity, 'but two railrccds
serving tbe saime place are a luxury. Tbis is
ne time for tlîis country te indulge in
luxuries.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Were the interviews te wbich tbe bonourablo senator has
referred avith. Mr. Fullerton, the Chairman cf
the Board of Trustees cf the Canadian
National Railvays?
Riglit H.n. Mr. MEIGIIEN.

Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: 1 do flot wish te
drag the Canadian National trustees inte this
discuss;on.
Now, I am advised that the Canadian
Pacifie officiais think tboir company would
lose prestige if its trains ran over any right
cf way of the Canadien National. Tbe Canadian Pacifie is a great company and, as I
have said, it has done mucb for tbis Dominion,
but it must net forgot tbat it cannct in tbese
days play the part of the dog in tbe manger.
Why should tbe company lose prestige? I
do net think it bas any more prestige te lose,
anywav. I have always admired the Canadien Paciflc Railway, for several reasons. In
the oaî-ly days 1 was on a Canadian Pacifie
suî-vey tbrougbi a God-forsaken
country.
There was a foot of snow on the ground and
we werc in ccir sumamer outflts. I was one cf
chaiui men, and I remember having te
wade thîrough a creek. I kept warm by shaking myseif. It shows tbat bardships do net
kili anyone. That avas at tbe time cf the
Mackenzie Gcvernment.
The huilding cf the C.P.R. commenced in
1882. There was tbic incident of 1872, the
time of the Pacifie scandai; but that dees
net come intc tbis question. Aftcr the contract te build tbic railroad was agreed upon,
tho C.P.R. got, first, seme $25,00000 in solid
f-ash. In 1882 that was a groat dccl cf mcney.
Thon the cmpany was granted 25.000.000

time lac w-as the only Liberal elected west cf

bring into this Huse the legislatiun which

MARCU 21, 1934
governs the passes which ail bonourable gentlemen now carry. Under that law we travel
free, and we owe no gratitude to any railroad in this country.
In addition to what I have already mentioned the C.P.R. was allowed to fix its own
rates. There was no0 railway board in those
days. There was a railway committee of the
Privy Council, but it acted very indifferently.
Furthermore, the C.P.R. distri'buted $100
shares of stock in the company upon the payment of $25. 1 arn speaking now about something that I know only by heursay. I was
too young in those days to appreciate it; but
I have heard about it for more than f orty
years. 1 may be wrong, but I have flot the
slightest doubt that, if 1 arn, the right honourable gentleman who leads this House will put
me right.
That was the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
market value for a number of years.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Pardon me. The
shares were issued to the inner circle. One
very old man, Sir Francis Hineks, when
offered some of thase shares at $25, said, "At
my time of life I would sooner have the
cash."
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: And those shares
paid a dividend of 86-six per cent on the
par value. That is my information. If it is
wrong I stand to be ýcorrected. When you
receive twenty-four per cent on your money
you get back in less than five years ail that
you have put in.
I ar n ot begrudging anything that bas been
given to the C.P.R. It was needed for the
building of a railroad through a country
where there were no0 people at the tirne
except a few Indians--Flatheads and Creeswho had no money to buy tickets or to pay
for the carniage of freight. As a matter of
fact, for years the Indians did the freighting
with their Red River carts--they did sorne for
me-and they did it more cheaply than the
railroad could do it.
Then came a time when the C.P.R. was
very close to bankruptcy, and Mr. Van Horne,
as he then was, came up to Ottawa with Mr.
George Stephen to ask Sir John A. Macdonald
to advance themn some $22,000,000 in order
that the railway might carry on.
Sir John,
contrary to bis habit, said: "I have done all
I arn going to do for the C.P.R. 1 will do
no more." Next morning Mr. Van Horne
visited Mr. Collingwood Sebreiber, the Deputy
Minister of Raalways of the time, and said to
hirn, "There is nuthing for us to do-we are
ruined and bankrupt," and he broke down,

for perhaps the onîy trne in bis life, and cried
like a child. But that did not get him any
money. Then he went to the old Russell
House, and who should corne in but the Hon.
Frank Smith, of Toronto, wbo was, 1 think,
a minister without portfolio in the (lovernment of Sir John A. Macdonald. He saw
these men looking very dejected, and when
he heard their story he said, "Don't go away,"
and he wen't to Sir John and asked hirn to
help them. Sir John replied, "I have done
s0 rnudh for themn that if I give anything
more to the C.P.R. I may be put out of
office?" But Frank Sm.ith, who was a clever
Irishrnan, said, "If you give t-hern something
you rnay be put out of office, but if you
do not, and they fail, you will certainly be
put out." So Sir John changed bis mi, and
Frank Srnith went back and told these men
what had happened. The next morniog a
prominent man in Montreal, a great banker,
perhaps one of the greatest in the city, was
sitting in one of the biggest banks with a
revolver in bis hand, and had ià not been
that the answer of Sir John Macdonald was
favourable this man would have blown his
brains out.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is history.
If lie had done that, the institution he represented might have gone down with hirn.
,On that occasion Sir John A. Macdonald
saved the C.P.R.-and I amn glad to be able
to say ýthat those 822,000,000 were refunded
to the last cent and the country dïid not lose
anything in consequence of wha't had taken
place. So the C.P.R. went on its way and
created not rnerely the greatest transportation
systern in Canada, but what is perhaps the
greatest transpoiltation systemn in the world.
The facilities of that cornpany encircle the
globe, and its ships3 do business throughout
the seven seas.
The Canadian Pacifie Railway Company is
a gre~at company. At -the sarne tirne it should
not forget that the people of Canada have
heen good ýto it. It should realize to-day that
it is not the only pebhle on the beach. The
C.P.R. feels that if it were to use part of
the Canadian National System-and here is
the concrete subject I desire to bring before
the House-there would be a loss of prestige.
Only on Monday last, in another place, the
Prime Minister said we were losing $1,250,000
a week on onar railways.
That means
565,000,000 a year. Last session when I said
that we were loaing a million dollars a week,

188

SENATE

to apprehend exactly the purport of all the
remarks of the honourable gentleman who has
just sat down, but I assure you that I have
tried sedulously to appreciate the significance
of every one of his sentences. His notice of
inquiry was that lie would call attention to
the trustees of the Canadian National Railways, and ask for information about the operation of pool trains. In view of the terms of
that notice, I cannot understand why lie
should now exhibit such delicacy with relation to the trustees. His notice specifically
states that lie is going to ask the House to
take a look at them.
The inquiry, in so far as it asks for information, is very vague, and consequently the
answer may not be what is desired. I shall
endeavour to summarize that answer. After
co-operative management of the two systems
was decided upon, pool trains were adopted
and extended, and solely in consequence of
the operation of pool trains an annual saving

of $1,000,000 a year is now being made, whieh
saving is being divided almost equally between the two s
ems. That is no negligible
achievement.

That deficit, though, would be smaller if the
honourable gentleman's assiduity in the public
interest had been of earlier birth, and if lie
Lad sought to prevent the additions made
to the National System in the last nine
years, which additions I think I can say
were one and all prejudicial to its balance

handicapped from the beginning by constituent elements wlich could never-or, at
all events, not within the lifetime of the
present generation-be placed on a paying
basis. It is Landicapped to-day net only on
this account, but also because of tfose incompreliensible additions to which, so far as
I know, the Lonourable senator never took
any exception. At any rate, if le took exceptien, it was wlolly ineffectiv'e.
I call Lis
attention to the tremendous Joad heaped on
the system in the province of Queber. The
honourable gentleman knows what I mean.
He is aware that $6,000,000 was paid for a
heterogeneous series of disconnected linesHon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Quebec, Montreal and Southern Railway.

R ght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

is greater than it should have been, and I
do net doubt that it will take a long time to
scale the mountains that are in front of the
National Railways.
The honourable gentleman complains that
we are net proceeding rapidly enough along
the line of Government policy, and le is
especially critical of the delay in the appointment of the National Railways trustees. He
tells us it was represented to the House
last session that the policy decided upon,
with a view to effecting economies in the
operation of both systems, was probably a
wise one, and lie complains that the putting
of this policy into effect was considerably
delayed by the failure to appoint trustees
carlier. He asks why, if the policy was good,
it was not put into effect immediately, and
why, if the policy was bad, it was ever
adopted. The same question could be asked
with respect to any item of policy decided
upon by any Government. My mind goes
backe te a time when I was fairly young, when
the honourable gentleman's leader of tFiat day
feared lie Lad been too slow-that he Lad
net risen to his opportunities and acted
promptly enougli in projecting the great
Transcontinental Railway. All political leaders
are at times troubled by similar fears. But
though when the time comes to act they may
fear they have been too slow, after the result
of the action is manifest they sometimes
begin to wonder whether they have net procceded too rapidly.
I now brace myself for the tremendous
task of answering the honourable gentleman's
question why the trustees were not appointed
earlier. It was the belief of the Governmuent that a board of trustees, erected according to the plan suggested by the Duff-Flavelle
Commission and given the necessary sanction
of authority and means of enforcement, could
bring about economies by compelling the two
systems to work together. That tlis conclusion was wise is now, I think, pretty
gencrally agreed. Therefore, the honourable
gentleman asks, why was action net taken
sooner? Well, if.there had been too much
haste and the wrong men Lad been appointed,
far more harm would have been done than
if no appointments had been made. The
summer had nearly gone before the three
trustees were selected. I may tell the lionourable senator there were demands that
various divisions of Canada be represented
on the board; but, after all, the Government
could ehoose only three men. Many were
the arguments advanced as to what portions
of the country had the highest and strongest
claims to representation; and no doubt
claims were also made on behalf of in-

but 1 arn told hie, too, is very able. The trustees should be given the fullest liberty of

Parliament, it is true, represents publie opinion, but the railway situation has reached

Honourable
Hon. LUCIEN MORAUD:
senators, rny honourable friend frorn De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has given us
bis views on the pooling cf trains. I wsis a
member of the executive of the Canadian
National Railways for a couple of years, and
I should like te meve the adj ourrnent of the
dqEýbate in order that to-morrew I rnay have an
epportunity of speaking te the motion. If,
huwever, it is desired that the debate shall
proceed, I shail enideavour to explain what
lias been done sinoe ls.st session te bring
about the poeling of train services.
It is a complicated inatter te bring about
a satisfactery pooling of trains. On receiving instructions we sppointed three experts
te meet three experts appointed by the

C.P.R. and with tbern to work out a joint
arrangement satisfactory to both systems.
The proposed pooling agreement involved a
reduction not only of train services, but also
of personnel, and only lately d'id those experts
reach their first agreement for pooling the
train service between Montreal and Toronto.
Subsequently, tbe agreement was extended to
take in tbe service between Quebec and
Montreal and between Ottawa and Toronto.
This agreement bas resulted in a reduction
of five Canad:ian National and eight Canadian
Pacifie trains, with a resultant saving in
operation cosis of hundreds of thousands of
dollars. 0f course there is no doubt that the
ideal seheme would be to bave a general
pooling throughout the country; but it seems
that the experts of tbe tiwo lines cannot agree
as to that.
1 understand that frorn the lst of January
te date the increase in the revenue of the
Canadian National Railways has been twentyfour per cent, and of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway seventeen per cent; so, if business
continues to improve as it bas been doing
recently, tbe country rnay reasonably expect
by next year a $25,000,000 reduction in the
deficit. Tbe pooling of passenger trains-for
there is no question of pooling the freight
trains-will not bring about as great an
economy as sorne people expect, but the
saving will probably arnount to 315,000,000 or
$20,000,000, a very substantial sum.
This poolicg problern bas been worked on
for a year by the experts of both roads. It
is a rather complicated matter, invoiving
reductions of ail kinds, including a reduetion
of men; and whenever a reduction of service
is mentioned protests are heard from the community affected. Ail that I desire to say,
ainiee I amn not perrnitted te adjourn the
debate, is that the executives of the Canadian
National Railways bave tried since last year
te comply with the instructions given thern,
and under the circulmstances bave done as
well as could be expected.

period from four to six weeks shorter than
the time allowed them. We are informed
that flot only the fishermen, but also the
people engaged in disposing of the fish are
so well satisfied with the work of the Commission that they are to-day asking that its
powers be increased and that it be allowed to
control the movements of fishing vessels so
that their operations may be spread over the
full period. One can understand the reason
for that. If the catch is brought in over an
extended period marketing conditions will be
better than if it is brought in within a comparativeiy short time.
In bis remarks of yesterday my honourable
friend from Vancouver made a rather interesting staternent. It will be found on page 169
of Hansard. Referring to the Hecate Straits,
he said:
This territory inight well have been regarded
as within the sphere of influence of this
Domiinion.
In making that statement the honourable
gentleman wvas absolutely correct. A most
distinguished member of this flouse who bas
had great experience in the matter of negotiatien between Canada and the United States
on the fisheries question-I refer to the honourable senator from North York (Hon. Sir
Allen Aylesworth)-has called my attention to
the fact that in July, 1908, the American
Goverument were desirous of laying a cable
from Gr-ay's Harbour, Washingtun, northward through le-cate Straits, eaut of the Queen
Charlotte Isl*ands, across Dixon Entrance and
up into the passage Vo Ketchiken, and they
made representations to the Britishi Government, and through Mr. Whitelaw Reid, then
UJnited States Ambassador in London, asked
for permission to, do. so. This letter is to be
found in full at page 205 of the Appendîx
to the British Counter Case in the North
Atlantic Coast Fisheries Arbitration at The
Hague in 1910. It is interesting Vo note that
in his letter -the Ambassador had this Vo, say:
It wi 11 he noted, however, that Hecate
Straits and Dixon Entrance are British waters.
This bit of information, whieh rny honourable
friend from North York has placed in rny
hand Vo-day, is, I Vhink, of great interest not
only Vo, the members assexnbled here, but to
Canada generally; and if a cornmittee of this
Chaniber should be set up it would be well to
have tbis reference carefufly investigated and
made a matter of record. I rnay eay that the
permission asked for was granted.
In talking Vo the honourable member froni
North York this rnorning I suggested that he
should speak on this subi ect and make Vhs
statement hiniself, because I knew that he
certainly would des], with tbe situation much

better than I could. However, it was not bis
desire to take part in tbe discussion, and I
arn pleased to have had the oppor.tunity of
bringing tbis matter to the attention of
honourable members.
My bonourable friend from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) suggested that if a conimittee were set up it rnight be advantageous
Vo bave it study Vbe question of the propagation of our flsh. Hie cited the resuit of the
activities of the Biologîcal Board in placing
fisb in the lakes about. Jasper Park. I have
in mmid a similar experience which shows
what can be done in the way of propagation,
if we can get the people interested. In 1912
some of our friends in the Kootenay country,
who were interested in sport, prevailed upon
the department to send in a quantity of
Kamloops trout, and these were placed in
Premier lake, wbicb wvas devoid of fish at the
time. Within four years fish up to fourteen
pounds were being taken out of that lake.
That naturally caused some excitement
throughout the countryside. and our friends
formed a club. In the year 1921 or 1922
tbcy huilt a smnall hatchery and proceeded to
have eggs hatched that had been taken
from the cut-throat and .the rainbow trout.
They got into some difficulties, and the
Department of Fisheries was prevailed upon
to lend thein an expert, who was sent there
at small cost, and finally they were 80 successfui with their batchery that three of four
years ago tbey built a new one, which now
supplies ail they need and in addition enables
them Vo, give to the Dominion Government
many Vhousands of eggs and, fish. These have
been placed in the park lakes Vo the north,
at Banff. Last year the hatchery made a
profit on shipping eggs Vo various parts of the
province.
I believe that the departrnent could do
much good work along the line of having the
lakes and rivers supplied witb a quantity of
sporting fisb. In every comrnunity there are
men wbo are very eager Vo help in the preservation of these fish. Not only is tbe sport
advantageous Vo tbe people wbo live near
lakes and streanis, but we know that it i8
one of the strongest attractions for tourists
and visitors. In illustration of this point I
have only to mention Camnpbell river, on
Vancouver Island, where what is known as
the Tyee Club bas been in existence for rnany
years. People corne frorn ail over the world
to fisb the Tyee salmon, and if you are Vaking
part ini the sport, say in Juiy or August, you

hundred boats moving back and forth, trawling
for these fish.
That sport is of great
advantage to the local residents and furnishes
a wonderful pleasure to those who engage
in it.
As my honourable friends from British
Columbia know, now and then a rumour
is started that someone engaged in purseseine fishing has secured permission to purseseine off a certain point, or certain points,
and as a result there is much consternation.
I do not believe the department
would permit such a thing, but a committee
of the kind suggested might very well consider the matter for the purpose of obtaining,
by resolution or otherwise, definite assurance
that those areas which are capable of development for sport fishing shall be preserved free
from interference.
With regard to the sockeye salmon question, I have no doubt that if it had rested
entirely between the federal governments of
Canada and the United States it would have
been settled many years ago, but unfortunately those who have been trying to negotiate
a treaty for saving and improving the sockeye fishing on the Fraser river have met with
stubborn resistance from the State of Washington, whose coast line is passed by the
salmon as they come into the Fraser river.
So long as a profit could be made by those
who were engaged in the salmon fishing the
State of Washington would not take a reasonable position in a discussion, and it was only
within the last five years, when it became
evident that some agreement between the two
countries was essential to prevent the extinction of the fish, that the authorities of that
state were willing to consider in a satisfactory
manner the naking of a treaty.
In 1929 we were informed that a proposal
then being presented to Parliament would be
agreeable to the authorities in the State of
Washington. But some objections were raised
in the House of Commons by members from
British Columbia, and the bill was withdrawn.
It was reintroduced in slightly amended form
in 1930, when it was passed to the satisfaction
of all concerned. But unfortunately no agreement has yet been reached on the matter
in the United States Senate, although many
people who have been following the course of
negotiations are still hopeful that that body
will pass the bill. Whatever is done will have
to be with the concurrence of the State of
Washington. In my opinion, if the treaty
should pass and commissioners be appointed
and given powers as suggested, it is not too
much to expect, as my honourable friend
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) said
yesterday, that the salmon fishery will be
restored, and it will be capable of producing
Hon. Mr. KING.

every

year wealth to the value of twenty to
thirty million dollars.
Therefore this fishery is certainly a subject
that might well be considered by this Chamber or a committee. The honourable mover
of the resolution (Hon. Mr. Taylor) has not
definitely stated the 'limits to which the committee should be confined. His address dealt
principally with three matters, the two existing
treaties and the one now under consideration
at Washington. I notice that the right honourable leader of the House indicated in his
address of yesterday that if a committee is
appointed its powers should be strictly defined. I think he felt that a committee to
investigate fisheries in British Columbia should
not be a "fishing" committee, and in this I
am in agreement with him. There seems to
be peace in the province with regard to the
administration of the fisheries, and I should
not like to sec a committee requesting the
various contending interests to give evidence
at this time. However, after having listened
to the remarks of the right honourable leader
and of my honourable friends from the province of British Columbia, I believe that a
committee appointed by this Chamber might
render valuable service in inquiring into the
effects and results of the treaties now in
existence, and might also obtain some useful
information with respect to the advantages of
a treaty relating to the sockeye salmon on
the Fraser river.
I have a suggestion, which I hesitate to
make. To me this debate has been instructive
and enjoyable, and I think sufficient material
has been given to honourable members to
justify careful consideration for some time.
We are now two months into this session. and
my suggestion is that perhaps more good
would be donc if a committee were appointed
at the beginning of next session rather than
this year. However, this is merely a personal
thought, and I wish to make it clear that I
see no real objection to the proposal of my
honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Taylor).
If a committee is appointed this year it
will undoubtedly do much good work in the
interest of the province of British Columbia.
Should the amendment be passed and matters
relating to 'the fisheries of Eastern Canada be
inquired into, these also, I am sure, will
receive very careful study. In any event, the
work done by such a committee would of
necessity be advantageous to the whole fishing industry.
On motion of Hon. J. A. McDonald, the
debate was adjourned.

CANADIAN PACIFIC RAIL WAY
COMPANY BILL
THIIRD READING

Hon. Mr. COPP, for Righit Hon. Mr.
Graham, moved the tbjrd reading of Bill 23,
an Act to ratify and confirm the agreement
respecting the joint use by the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company of certain tracks
and premises of His Majesty at Saint John,
N.B.
Hon, W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
my purpose in rising is not to take any
objection to the motion for third reading.
The city fromn which I come is mentioned in
the Bill. I bad not read the Bill before it
went to the committee, but I have since
done so. The fact that it provides for joint
use of certain tracks at Saint John tends to
show there is a preponderance of common
sense in the community affected. The interest
rate on capital account is four and a balf
per cent; so eacb railway ivili bave to pay
only two and a quarter pcr cent. I may say
that a similar arrangement bias been in operation since tbe early nineties, wben the Canadian Pacific first came to Saint John. If
the principle then adopted had heen extended
to the railwvay facilities of the Dominion
there would have been a corresponding reduction in interest charges, and we should
not now be faced with the serious railway
problem wbich is causing the country so
mucli concern.
The motion was agreed to, and tbe Bill was
read the third ýtime, and pa.ssed.

With respect to the petition of Aziz Koudsy,
otherwise known as Eddie Coudsy, of the. city
of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, clerk,
for an Act to dissolve his mnarriage with Marie
Shahda Koudsy:
The Comxittee recommend that out of the
parliamentary f ees paid under Rule 140 the
suma of $50 be paid to the respondent on
account of the conduet of lier defence.
All which is respectfully submitted.
Will the lionHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourahie gentleman explain wliat hias been the
practice heretofore?
Hon. Mr. RO)BINSON: Since I have been
a member of the Divorce Committee it lias
been tbe practice to rccommend a refund of
fees in certain circumstances. In this case
two applications were made: tlie petitioner
asked for a refund on the ground of poverty;
the respondent stated she bad no money, but
desired to contest the case. After a very
careful examination of the affidavits submibted the Comrnîttee decided to reocommend
thai $50 of the fees a]ready paid in by tlie
petitioner lie paid out to tlie respondent.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Has that ever been
done hefore?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I believe so.
Ri glt Hon. Mr. MEIGiHEN: I think tbere
is precedent for ordering the petitioner to
provide funds for bis wife for purposes of
defence, but tliat money sbould be provided
for such purposes out of fees paid to the
House in respect of divorce proceedings is
something that I have neyer beard of before.
I put myself in the hands of lionourable
senators who have bad longer experience, but
it seeme to me a very doubtful precedent
from the standpoint of law, and still more
doubtful from the standpoint of practice.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It bias been customary in certain cases to refund fees paid
by the petitioner witb respect to, divorce
proceedings. -Occasionally a petitioner lias
been allowed to proceed witliout actually
paying fees. Inu this case it was thouglit wise
to recommend, a refund of $50 to the
petitioner, and also payment of $50 to the
respondent.

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON, Acting Ohairman
of the Standing Committee on Divorce, presented 'the thirteenth report as follows:

Is not the
petitioner required to deposit $200 on filing
bis petition?

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I think the total
deposit is $210. In some cases there is a
refund, but usually action is taken when the
petitioner is before the Committee. This
case lias net yet been heard and we are acting
on the strength of affidavits which have been
filed with the Clerk of the Committec.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable mombers, as
one who has had some little experience of
the Divorce Committee during the past few
years, I may be permitted to give my understanding of this recommendation. When the
petition was filed the parliamentary fec of
8210 was paid, and later an application was
ruade for the refund of a portion of that fee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
hearing?

Before the

Ion. Mr. COPP: Yes. It is the practice
for the Conmmittee to consider applications
for refund which are accompanied by affidavits of the petitioner and one or two other
persons familiar with his circumstances.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: On what ground
is the application made?
Hon. Mr. COPP: On the ground of
povertyv. If the Committee decides that the
petitioner is not in a position to pay, it is
its custorn te recommend a refund of all but
$50, which is the cost of printing. In this case,
I understand, after the fee was paid, an application fromn the petitioner for a refund, and
an application froin the respondent for money
to enable lier to put in a defence came before
the Committee. The usual amount allowed
to a respondent in such cases is in the first
instance $50. This may be increased later if
the hearing turns out to be an extended one
and therefore more costly than bas been
anticipated. In this case the money was net
transferred to the respondent, but refunded to
the petitioner; thon an order was made that
the petitioner should pay the respondent the
sum of 850, not necessarily out of this money.
Until that order is complied with the case
will not be heard.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If it is permissible
I should like to have it taken into consideration now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question I
put lias net yet been answered. Has it been
the practice of the Divorce Committee to
allow provision to be made for the defence of
the respondent out of the deposit made by
the petitioner?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I am told that it
bas been donc. This is the first case of it
that lias come within my experience.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If I understand the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) aright, it lias long been
the practice, on a proper case being made
out, to refund a portion of the fee. I was not
aware that it was the practice to make a
refund before the hearing. I am told now
that it is. Acting on that practice, the Conmittee bas recommended the refund of a portion of the fee. Undoubtedly it has been the
practice in cases of poverty on the part of
the defendant. when the defendant is the
wife, to order the husband te pay a certain
amount, starting with $50, to enable lier to
bring witnesses, if she bas them, and to make
lier defence. That has been donc in this case.
The plaintiff has in his hand the money
refunded; so it is his money. Therefore this
order is in accordance with the practice.
It is pretty hard

PRIVATE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. FOSTER moved the third reading of Bill D, an Act to incorporate Personal
Finance Corporation.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: When this Bill was
in committee I raised a question as to section
5, which reads as follows:
The Company nay throughout Canada:-(a)
buy, sell, deal in and lend money on the
security of conditional sales agreements, lien
chattel
notes, hire purchase agreements,
inortgagesand so on. In the province of Quebec we
have no such thing as a chattel mortgage,
but the Bill apparently would confer upon this
particular company the right to carry on that
kind of business in the province of Quebec.
When I raised in the committee some question as to the words "throughout Canada,"
I was supported in my view by the honourable senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr.
Brown), whose knowledge of law is well
known, and who I think would net have taken
such a position unless these words had some
significance. Consequently I suggested to the

MARCH 22, 1934
ecommittee that they should be deleted, so
that the province of Quebec, at least, would
not be interfered with. Not having succeeded
before the committee, I want to register my
protest here against these two words. If I
can find a seconder I shaîl move that the
two words after the word "may," in section
5, be stricken out.
Hon. Mr. CASGRMIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if it would not be
against the Civil C'ode in Quebec to buy or
deal in chattel mortgages?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Undoubtedly.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIjN: In that event the
words can do no harm.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Honourable members,
this matter was thoroughly discussed in comniittee. A question arose as to the two words
"througliout Canada," and ut was explained
that the wording of tbe section was the same
as bas appeared in tbree bills of a like
character that have been passed by the committee and eventually by the Senate. If I
remember correctly, it was statcd in the
committee that in the province of Quebec it
is not legal to give or deal in chattel
mortgages, and therefore the inclusion of the
words "tbroughout Canada" would not give
the company power to act contrary to the
Iaw of that province. I have no particular
mnterest in the Bill, except that I am named as
the sponsor, and I believe that the principle
of the measure is a good one at the present
time. It is unfortunate that there should be
a need for such companies.
Hon. Mr. MUTRDOICK: Honourable members, I was mentioned as sec'onding the
motion for third reading of this Bill, and
I desire to say that this is an error, for I
am opposed to the measure. In My opinion
such legislation is nothing more nor less than
legalized sculduggery, and I do not want to
have anything to do with it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The seconder
of the motion is the honourable senator
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy).
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, about ten yeare ago there was passed
in the province of Quebec the Parent Act.
This was a great surprise to us, for it
inaugurated an entirely new syetem wbich
completely changed the principles of the Civil
Law by permitting chattel mortgages by bonds.
But my honourable friend from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Parent) will see that the Act to
which I refer legalizes chatteI mortgages only
when they are given by bonds. The present
measure, s0 far as I know, does not refer

197

to bonds, and, consequently it cannot authorize the coiupany to deal in chattel mortgages
in the province of Quebec.
Yf I may, I would suggest that after the
words "chattel mortgages" the word "pledges"
be add-ed. This would make the section conform. with Quehec law. The objeet upon
which a guarantee is given would pass into
the posseaSion of the lender.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable members, I should like to ask whether there is flot
a rule of the Senate which requires one day's
notice of a motion to amend a bill on third
reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Rule 24 provides:
One day's notice must be given of any of
the following motions:
(c) For any substantial amendment to a
private bill.
So it seems that the ýamendment of the
honourable gentleman froma Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Parent) would require a day's notice.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
three other bis similar to this have been
previously passed by the Committee on Banking and Commerce and by this House. In
the present instance the Committee decided,
with I think only one adverse vote, to leave
the two words "throughout Canada" in section 5, because these words wcre contained in
the three earlier measures. According to the
legal opinion given to our committee, the
inclusion of the words would have no effeet
whatever upon the Civil Law of Quebec witb,
relation to chattel mortgages.
Right Hon. Mr. METOHIEN: Honourable
senators, if there is a rule requiring one day'i;
notice of an amendment on third reading,
there is no reason why it should not bc
applied here; but honourable members wiIl
observe the rule refers to a "substantial
amendment."
With ail deference to the
Chair, and to the honourable senator froma
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent), I think the
amendment is not substarutial; indeed, if
t here ýever was an unsiîbstantial amendment
this is one.
As leader of the House I have no special
interest in the amendment, nor in wbether
the Bill is carried or rejected, but perhaps I
owe it to honourable members to do what I
can to make clear what question we are now
considering. Among other things in this Bill,
as in three other bills passed since 1928, there
i a provision that the company may throughout Canada buy, sell, deal in and lend money
on certain securities, and included in the list
are "chattel mortgages." Now, in the province of Quebec there is no such thing known

198

SENATE
SENATE

to the Civil Law as a chattel mortgage. The
honourable gentleman from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Parent) says there is an implication that
if the words "throughout Canada" are left
in the Bill the company may claim the right
to purchase or deal in chattel mortgages in
that province, and therefore he moves an
amendment that these words be stricken out.
My first observation is that the Bill would
be exactly the same whether these words were
in it or not, because any legislation passed
by Parliament is essentially and inevitably
effective throughout Canada unless there is
a specifie limitation, and there is none in this
instance. The only reason why the words are
used is that the language of the section is
uniform with that used in the previous
measures.
There is another reason why the inclusion
or omission of the two words would not alter
the effect of the Bill, namely, that no legislation by Parliament can enable anyone to
violate the law of a province. The implication is that if we by legislation empower a
company to do a certain thing, it can do that
only in so far as it does not thereby violate
a provincial law.
For these two reasons the effect of the Bill
would be exactly the same whether the words
were left in or stricken out. So far as I am
concerned, inasmuch as the amendment is
insubstantial, I sec no reason for delaying consideration of it. I think we ought to dispose
of the Bill in the affirmative or negaýtive.
The lion. the SPEAKER: Does the honourable gentleman insist on his amendment?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: With the leave of the
Senate I will withdraw the amendment. I
ask that third reading be not proceeded with
now, as I desire to give notice of an amendment to provide that section 5 of the Bill
shall not apply to the province of Quebec.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If I can get a
seconder, I will move in amendment that the
Bill be not now read a third time, but be referred to the Committee of the Whole House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I ask my
honourable friend what is the purpose of his
motion?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Personally I should
iike to know what is the necessity for a Bill
of this kind. It seems to me that among the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN,

things which have interfered with the livelihood and the welfare of ordinary, humble
citizens of Canada have been such measures
as this, which legally empower someone to
exploit the unfortunate. Of course, I may
be entirely mistaken, but in any event, I
certainly should like to know more about the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I second the motion
for referenice to Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We may as well
dispose of the matter on third reading, without going into committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It may be entirely
my fault that I do not know anything more
than I do about the Bill, but it seems to
me that there is a tendency ta rush it through.
I have no doubt that the Committee had the
measure under advisement, and that each
member of the Committee knows what it is
all about. I wonder whether it would be
improper for those of us who have not that
knowledge to ask, on behaif of ordinary, unfortunate citizens, for some information.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have a lot
of sympathy with the stand taken by the
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock). The Committee threshed out the
Bill, and at first the members took the same
view as that expressed by the honourable
gentleman, but after argument and fuller consideration the measure was adopted. As far
as I know, the motion for reference to Committee of the Whole is in order, and I would
offer no objection to it, for in committee we
could carry on discussion without any limitation.
Hon. Mr. Mac.ARTHUR: Honourable senators, I am not a lawyer, and I must say
that I am not clear about this matter. I was
wondering whether the Bill would have the
same effect if the words "in every province
of Canada" were substituted for the words
"throughout Canada." It seems to me that it

would.
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent) is asking that
the words "throughout Canada" be stricken
out, and the right honourable leader of the
House states that if this were done there
would be no change in the effect of the Bill.
Then what harm would there be in taking
out these two words? The law would be
inoperative with respect to chattel mortgages
in the province of Quebec.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
the question at the moment, for the honourable gentleman from Kennebec has withdrawn his amendment. Of course, he can

199

motion of the honourable senator from,
Parkdale is carried. The question now is
whether we shall pass the motion for third

reading be not now given, but that the Bill
be referred to Committee of the Whole. The
reference to the Committee, if decided upon,
would, I suppose, be to-morrow.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Be fore resuming my
seat I shaîl propose a specdy disposition of
this question in the hope that early iiext

mind when making this motion a few days

May 1 refer, very briefly, to some observations made by the right honourable leader of
the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) in
wvhich he took a position that I do not think
we should be asked to endorse. The right
honourable gentleman said:
I arn not going to take a position to-day in
regard to either the amendment or the motion,
save to make one comment. I know the House
will flot be desirous of laumching inquiries which
make it necessary te bring witnesses long distances, and consequenthy involve considerahile

purpose of every inquiry should be as definite
as possible, and it should be a prerequisite, I

200

SENATE

think, that a prima facie case is made against
the administration of a branch as at present
conducted.
Last week when I made my motion I congratulated myself on being able to present
to the House a question not in any sense
controversial, but one that, as I saw it, was
of interest to a great many honourable members. What I then said could not, I submit,
be interpreted as an intention on my part
to put any department of the Government
"on the spot." I felt it would be of value to
the Senate to have information with respect
to the three main subjects with which I
then proceeded to deal, in order that honourable members might be in a position to judge
not only of the activities of the Department
of Fisheries, but also of the responsibility of
the Government in leaving that important
department for many years without a responsible head. Naturally, not being desirous
of arousing any controversial feeling, I did
not stress this point, but I simply directed
attention to the three subjects that, to my
mind, were most important to the province
of British Columbia, and suggested the manner
in which improved conditions could be brought
about.
Perhaps I was delinquent in refraining from
putting the department "on the spot." Since,
however, I am challenged, I shall point out
why I consider the department subject to
criticism. I have before me the Pelagic
Scaling Treaty. Article 2, in part, is as
follows:
The United States agrees that one-fifth in
nuimber and in value of the total number of
sealskins taken annually upon the Pribilof
Islands, or any other islands or shores of the
waters above defined, subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States, te whieh the seal herd
now frequenting the Pribilof Islands hereafter
resorts, shall be delivered at the end of each
season to an authorized agent of the Canadian
Government in the Pribilof Islands.
Only lately has it come to my knowledge
that someone in the department, without any
authority whatever, and in utter disregard of
this article of the treaty, decided not to have
anylhing to do with such smelly things as
sealskins in their green state, preferring,
apparently, to handle nice, clean American
money. And he seems to have left the calculation of Canada's share to the parties on
the other side.
There is more involved in this than the
loss to Canada of the difference in price of
the skins as taken on the Pribilof Islands and
their ultimate value. I have seen no definite
statement, but from information that has
reached me I infer that the United States
value the green skins at about $2.50 each.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

The native killers are paid seventy-five cents
for each skin. At St. Louis the skins are
processed, and the cost of this processing is
put at such a figure as to leave only about
S2.50 as the value in which we are to share
at one-fifth.
Recently I saw a fur sale report showing
the prices received by the United States for
each parcel of sealskins sold during the year
under review. The prices ranged fron $51 for
prime skins down to about $21 for the lower
quality. The average price was nearly $30 a
skin for the total marketed. Despite his
knowledge of this report and of other information published by the American Government with respect te the revenue derived
from the annal sale of sealskins, some one in
our Department of Fisheries assumed the responsibility of accepting twenty per cent of
$2.50 per skin, or less, as our full share of the
value of the sealskins sold at prices ranging
from $26 te $50. In my judgment any departmental official guilty of such dereliction
of duty should be put "on the spot."
But thecre is more involved.
Iefore the
treaty was entered into the proce-ug cf
sealskins was a very important indury in
the Mother Country. The annual -zie cf
sealskins sent to England by the Canadian
sealing fleet was a feature of the London fur
unarket. There came te the British people
engaged in the industry the difference betwen
the $2.50 value osf the skins at th' Fribilof
Islands and the $30 to $40 value when fuly
processed. Very little calculai
is neueded
to demonstrate the serions l-s 1I Briti-h
industry by this action on the part f oimte'
depairtmental official.
In the year last reported on by the department we were paid $2,600 as our one-ifth
share of the value of 49,000 skins. For easy
calculation let us assume that 10.000 skins
represented our share. I understand tha t
about six sealskins are requined to umake a
coat; so our 10,000 skins would represent
about 1,700 coats. W'hen seal-kins ivere in
fashion, a coat commonly sold for $500. and
I believe that even $1,000 was a common
price. It will be seen that we deliberately
deprived the British fur industry of more than
three-quarters of a million dollars a year
which they formerly derived from the operatien of this industry. This is one of the
matters on which I desired to get information
fron the department, where alonte it can be
secured. There is nothing in any of the Government reports giving details in this respect.
It is obvious that a special committete might
secure important resuits from an inquiry along
the lines I have suggested.

Department. In 1914 or 1915 the Government
of British Columbia engaged a Mr. William
F. Thompson, a scientiýst fram California, f0
study the habits of the halibut and to report
what, if anything, should he donc in connection wifh the industry. Mir. Th.ompson enjeys a high reputation in the United States
as a fisheries expert. H1e made most elaborate
reports, which were the subjec.t of publication
in the officiai returss of British Columbia for
two or three ye-ars. In addition, he addresscd an authoritative paper te the Conservation Commission af Canada. I have if
under my hand and could quofe very significant paragraplis from it, but shahl not do so.
I simply reier honourable gentlemen wvho are
interested f0, pages 90 atnd following of the
report of the Commission for 1915, where they
wiIl flnd a very instructive report on the conditp*on cf the halibut industry of Canada and
of Alaska.
Under the Halibut Treaty the deparfmnent
ten years ago engaged the same Mr. Thompson to make a series of observations. H1e is
making tbem in a vessel of bis own choice,
accompanied by a substantiel crew, nearly al
of wboma are Americans, and we are paying
at the rate of from $25,000 te $40,000 a year
for the tripping and the observations of this
steamer. We have carried that on for ten
years. We have spent upwards of ff2000
on observations wbich confirm tbe official reports made in 1915 and 1916, not disputing
tbemn in any respect, and wbich right up to
this moment have failed to produce any
beneficial resuits to the halibut flsbery. I
say with ahl deliberation, and with a perfect
realization of the significance of my words,
that, in the light of the definite reports
previously made by MT. Thompson, and the
reports he is now making year by year, we
bave donc nothîng te get results other than
te conflrm by observation facts already in
our possession.
You may asic, "Is there net a closed
season?" There is, but Mr. Thompson reports in his literature that the closed season,
te be effective, should be prolonged from
Deceinber te April and should be repeated
year af fer year. There bas recently been
instituted a closed season of three months,
and we have Mr. Thompson's report on that,
te the effeet, that il is for economic effort
rather than for protection of the halibut, We
are supposed te, get reports from time te time
from this commission for the conservation of
the halibut industry. When 1 spoke about
this four years ago I was told that the com-

201

mission had reported from time to time;
that while I knew of only one report, there
actually had been five. iNaturally 1 feit
humbled, being, as 1 tbought, an alert newspaper man, at letting four reports go by without even knowing they had been presented.
Sbortly afterwards I got the four reports, ail
printed in 1930, after the date at which I
addressed this bonourable House; and so far
as I have been able te ascertain, No. 5 of
19W0 is the last report available from this
Halibut Commission, which we have been
carrying on at a cost of $30,000 or S40,000
a year ever since. If there are other reports,
they seemn to have been locked up in the
Fisheries Department and reserved from
Parliament.
The gist of this No. 5 report is that the
closed season of three months is not imposed
as a measure of conservation, nor is it calculated to conserve the halibut fishery, or capable of conserving it, or preventing its absolute disappearance. In paragraph after paragraph of the sixty or seventy pages of that
report Mr. Thompson, the expert of the Commission, warns us that the short closed season
we have is designed rather to protect the
operator in one direction from losiing anytbing
by flot being out and taking halibut while
another operator is permitted to take if. So,
by something agreed upon by the two Governments, as well as by the twvo departments,
this closed season of thrpfi montbs is flxed.
I speak in the presence of perhaps ten or a
dozen honourable gentlemen who have been
members of governments in Canada and have
sat with the Privy Council, before whom matters of this kind would naturaily be brought
for discussion. I sbould like to learn from
any one of themn who hears me speak-as a
member of Council he could, I tbink, trespass
on his oath te this extent-whether he, as a
member of Council, bas at any time received
any worth-wbile information about the condition of the halibut industry, or about the
progress or lack of progress of the observation
party whicb we have been maintaining for
ten years. I feel satisfied that if bonourable
gentlemen bad been posted in that way in
the course of their duties as Privy Councillors,
siome of themn wouid have come to tbe rescue
during this debate.
I think I have shown that there is something worth while to, be inquired into in relation to the halibut, and that we cannot depend upon the privately spoken statements
of employees in the department, which are
not subject to inquiry or study.
The third division is the future of the
salmon industry. The treaty is a most onesided document, made for the preponderating

SENATE
benefit of the United States. It was made
on the one side by the Fisheries Department,
without the advantage of a minister at its
head, and on the other by the keenest brains
in the United States, who simply played us.
We know it is impossible to carry out the
terms of that treaty. Honourable gentlemen
think they are correct in stating that the
treaty provides that we are to receive onehalf the proceeds of the salmon fishery in
the Fraser area. It provides nothing of the
kind. It expresses, in the preamble, the
opinion that it would be very desirable that
we should share equally, but it lets it go at
that, and provides no means of bringing about
equality. I am satisfied that equality cannot
be brought about, and that if we sign the
treaty as it now stands at Washington, we
shall be gypped again on the sockeye salmon
as we have been gypped on seals and halibut.
I do not think my expression is any too
strong.
I have studied these matters for a great
many years.
I think the first work I did
for the press of British Columbia was my
story of the sealing eruption of 1892. I have
been keeping track of these matters ever
since, and I say nothing more important to
industry in Canada then these fishery matters
could engage the attention of this Senate.
The honourable senator fron Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) offered an amendment
enlarging the scope of the resolution as I had
written it. I know what was his inspiration
in doing this, and I agree with him. I am
aware that tahere are problems on the Atlantic
coast, as wvell as on the Pacifie coast, that
might very well engage our attention. I
have no desire at all te put any obstacle in
the way of an inquiry into those problems.
I realize, however, that te branch out there
would take time, which perhaps we cannot
afford at this session, and it would also entail
expense, which, as the right honourable
gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) very
properly pointed oct, should not be lightly
incurred. I do not think we could prepare
properly at this session te go satisfactorily
loto the many problems of the Atlantic. I
have to suggest, therefore, in order that the
two branches of the inquiry may proceed
together, that the Senate permit me to withd.raw the resolution I have moved, and also
permit the
onourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MoRae) to withdraw his
amendment. The honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MoRae) had to leave
the city this afternoon, but he authorized me
-I think he also left a message with the
honourable senator fron Manitou (Hon. Mr.
Sharpe), who is not in his seat at the moment
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

-to say that he was in perfect accord witli
my view that under these circumstances both
the resolution and the amendment should be
withdrawn, I suggest, therefore, that we should
be permitted to withdraw the resolution and
the amendment, and to leave the matter with
the idea of adding a Committee on Fisheries
to the regular committees of the Senate at
the beginning of next session, and of introduceing at the earliest opportunity an inquiry
into all these subjects. T'his is donc, not with
a view to putting any department or any
officer of a department "on the spot," but
for the purpose of enlightening Parliament
and placing ourselves in a position to deal
intelligently with the periodical reports of
these officials.
I would ask, honourable gentlemen, to be
permitted to withdraw my motion, and on
behalf of the honourable senator from Vancouver to be permitted to withdraw his
amendment.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I have spoken on the motion
and on the amendment, and consequently
have no right to speak again on trhe merits.
I have, however, a right to speak in relation
te the request for permission to withdraw.
The honourable member (Hon. Mr. Taylor)
intimated to me yesterday that he would ask
for permission to withdraw, and stated, as
he has to-day, that next session he would
ask the establishment of a Standing Committee on Fisheries. To this I acceded. But
meantime the situation has changed and I
now feel, for reasons which I shall give, that
I cannot accede to the request to withdraw.
The honourable member in his opening remarks quoted certain words of mine spoken
in this House two days ago, to which he took
exception. The quotation was as follows:
I am not going to take a position to-day in
regard to either the amendment or the motion,
save to make one comment. I know the House
will not be desirous of launching inquiries which
make it necessary to bring witnesses long distances, and consequently involve considerable
expense, unless it is felt not only that the question to be considered is important-and in this
all will agree-but that there is a reasonable
prospect of attaining results commensurate to
the outlay. This being so. it is well that the
purpose of every inquiry should be as definite
as possible, and it should be a prerequisite, I
think, that a prima facie case is made against
the administration of a branch as at present
conducted.
The criticism of the honourable gentleman,
if I gathered it correctly, was to the effect
that it was not necessary, as a prerequisite to
a discussion in this House, to make any complaint or criticism, as he expressed it, te "turn
the spotlight" on to the department. If that

203

MARCH 22, 1934
is the whole purport of bis contention, I agree.
What I suggested was that it was a prerequisite not to discussion, but to the establishment cf a committee with wide powers which
would commit this House and consequently
the country to substa.ntial expenditure, and
that unless there was an allegation, or we
were satisfied that a prima facie case had been
made out to show that something in the adinistration could be improved, the Bouse
would not feel ths.t we should undertake such
expenditure. To that position I adhere. I
do not know whether the honourable member
sought to attack that position as I stated it.
Now, at the conclusion of the debate, in
exercising ýhis right to reply, the honourable
mendier has certainly complied with the pr&
requisite by establishing a prima facie case.
Under a strict interpretation of the rule, a
reply ýmust deal with the contentions urged
on the other 6ide during the course of the
deibate. The honourable gentleman has seen
fit not to adhere to the rule-and to that I
take no exception-but has levelled substantial and scrious criticismns against the administration of a department extending over a
period of yeare, aýnd I thiink it would he most
unjust to close the matter now and leave the
department under imputations until we meet
again next session. I think it would be much
better that this committee should he appointed and given the powers asked for.
I have no objection to the withdrawal of
the amendment of the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Boýn. Mr. McRae), first, because it goes farther afield and would extend
the inquiry over sections with respect to
which there is no particular al4lcgation, and
aIse because it provides for clerical and stenographie assistance which possibly would
flot be needed. My principal reason for ad-

hering to the motion is that I arn desirous of
doing exactly what the honourable memiber
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor)
bas asked. Be has left these imputations. I
do flot know whether tbey are truc or not; I
have no knowledge at aIl of the feets; but I
suggest that we f ollow his request exactlythat we appoint this commnittee and give the
department an opportunity to appear before
it, so that we may ascertain whether or not
some improvement can be made, and whether
or not there has been the delinquency which,
prima facie, the honouralyle gentleman has
establisbed.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: If I .may express myself without makinfg a speech, I would say
that I arn pleaised at the suggestion o~fthe
right honourable gentlemnan.
With the leave of the Senate, the amendment was withdrawn.
The motion of Bon. Mr. Taylor was agreed to.

THE WORK 0F THE SENATE
INQUIRY

DISCUSSION

CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed frorn March 20 consideration of the question proposed by Hon.
Mr. Murphy:
To call the attention of the Governnient to
the work of the Senate and to the efforts made
hy the Senate to secure the initiation in this
House of Government measures, and to inquire
if it ia the intention of the Goveràntnent to
introduce in the Senate at an early date any
of the legisiation indicated in the Speech from
the Throne.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Bonourable senators, I moved the adj ournment of this debate
on behaif of the honourable gentleman fromn
Shediac (Bon. Mr. McDonald).
Hon. J. A. McDONALD: Honourable senators, I do not bother this Chamber very often,
and in the present instance 1 intend to speak
but a few moments. As I was flot trained
in a legisiative atmosphere, and my judgment
has not been influenced by a long and active
political career, perhaps I can discuss this
question fromn a littie different angle fromn
that taken by some honourable members wbo
have spoken before me. For many years 1
have been associated with the labour movement, though flot in an official capacity, and
I think 1 have the confidence of many of
our Canadian workmen. They are a little
puzzled about what the Senate is trying to
do in this discussion. Why ail this apologizing
for inaction? Why the apparent straining
to justify our existence, and the striving to
show that we have some powers which
evidently have not been exercised? What
the people want is action.
I came to this Chamber a few years ago,
more or less in the spirit of a crusader, filled
with thoughts of the great things that I was
going to accomplish. In 1921 we were faced
with a serious unemployment situation, and
on my request a special committee Was
appointed, of which I had the honour to be
made chairman. The other members of the
committee were the Hon. Senators Murphy,
Tanner, Pope, Nichoils, Barmer, L'Espérance,
Blain, McCall, Dandurand, Mitchell, Bostock,
Planta, Casgrain, Girroir and Turriff, fifteen
in ail, of whom I arn sorry to say that seven
have since passed away. We tried to consider the unemployment problemn from the
vîewpoints of the banker, the manufacturer,
and the workingman, and we had before us a
representative of each of those classes. Mr.
Henry T. Ross, Secretary of the Canadian
Bankers' Association, threw much light on
the general situation and made many timely
suggestions; Mr. J. E. Walsh, General Secretary of the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association, spoke on behaif of the manufacturers; and Mr. Arthur Martel, Vice-

W4

SENATE

President of the Trades and Labour Congress,
voiced the feelings of the workingman. We
also had the advantage of hearing the wellposted Deputy Minister of Labour, Mr.
Acland, and his assistant, Mr. Odam.
The whole

committee was

in earnest and

met frequently, sometimes sitting past the
midnight hour. We gave the best attention
we could to the problem. The evidence given
before us, covering 150 pages, may be considered to present a fair survey of the whole
unemployment problem at that time. Yet
I am sorry to have to say that when the
committee brought in its report, containing
findings and recommendations, no further
action was taken.
It seems to b the common thing nowadays
to make excuses for ourselves and place somewhere else the blame for everything that goes
wrong. It bas become an obsession to attack
our banks, trust companies, insurance conpanies, governments, and so on. But I want
to say that if this Chamnber had carried out
its obligations as faithfully as have those
spendid institutions, we might have had a
far brighter picture facing ns to-day. We
have been talking and thinking too much
about ourselves, looking at ie space we occupy and not considering our responsibilities
to our fellow men. The other day I was
listening over the radio to that great man,
President Roosevelt, and heard him say tiat
85 per cent of the business in the United States
is donc by people who receive a salary of
$2,000 a year or less. The President declared.
"Whben it cornes to a question of humanity
versus profits, there is no doubt about which
side I an on."
It really is worthi while to forget our own
troubles at times and think about those of
other people. Not many days ago I had the
privilege of talking to an executive of one of
the largest companies in Canada. He told me
that the president of that conpany, while
lying ill in hospital, heard that one of his
employees--one of the 85 per cent class of
small-salaried people-had suffered a broken
leg somewbere up in the woods, and that it
was practically impossible for him to receive
proper medical attention. So the head of
the company sent from his hospital bed a
message that that employee must be brought
back to the city, no matter what the cost
might be. The executive to whom I was
speaking said: "A few days afterwards the
president died, and while I was helping to
carry his coffin into the church a shadow
passed over the sky. It was a man going
home to his people."
Hon. Mr. McDON'ALD.

Now, I contend that we should not be too
greatly concerned about our powers, which the
publie know we have. We should not worry
over any casual criticismns in the press. A
newspaper may have 300,000 readers, but its
editorials are written by individuals, and the
judgment of any one of those 300,000 readers
may be just as good as that of the man who
writes an article. It bas been said that the
press does not give sufficient publicity to what
goes on in the Senate. Well, I think that if
we implement with action soine of the recommendations that have been made bere, we
shall get aill the nenspaper co-operation we
want.
One honourable member suggested that the
Sonate would be improved by the appointment to its membership of some of the clergy.
I think there is great merit in that proposal.
It seems to me there is an analogy between
the selection of senators and the sercening of
coal in a mine. The geographica!, racial,
religious and political screens are used, and
labour is ignored.
We bave not enough
representatives of the 85 per cent class, of the
"forgotten mn.' I want to suggest now that
there should be an increase in the labour
representation in the Senate.
We should resolve that, once we have
undertaken any inquiry or work whicb seems
to the seasoned minds of this Chambaer to lae
worth while, we will carry through. Actions
speak much londer than words.

I think that the ordinary citizen of Canada
quite appreciates the importance of the
Senate, and that it is unnecessary for us
to elaborate upon that importance. When I
was called to this Chamber the late Mr.

in an article dealing with the appointment of

SENATE
In particular I am inclined to think that they
suffered from an obsession to the effect that
the House of Commons was going to be a
very radical body, prone to rash innovation,
and that therefore a check upon them was
necessary. Well, I do not think the House of
Commons has been that kind of body at all.
Whether Liberals or Conservatives have been
in the majority, it has been in the broad sense
a conservative institution. I cannot call to
mind-though some other people may be able
to do so--a single radical measure passed there
in sixty-seven years. If such a measure had
been passed, I should not at all assume that it
was to the discredit of that House, because, as
I shall say later, I do not regard the word
"radical" as having any terrible or sinister
import.
The House of Commons, as I say, has been
in the broad sense conservative. In that it
bas reflected the mentality of the Canadian
-people, who as a rule have been and are
conservative in the broad sense, inclined not
to jiimp at new ideas, but rather to compromise. One can look backward and sec that
that las been the course of history under
responsible government, which, after a little
flare of rebellion, was brougbt about in a very
sober and gradual way. Confederation effected
very important changes in the constitution of
this country, but it was brought about in the
sanie sober and matter-of-fact way. A few
decades later it was said that Canada was at
the parting of the ways-that if she did not
beconie annexed to the United States she
would have to choose between absolute
separation from the British Empire or the
alternative principle of centralization as part
of an Imperial Federation. Canada did not
take any of these courses. She found a solution rather unexpectedly by the creation of
what is practically a nexv international relationship within the Enpire. This solution
is likely to have a very important influence
upon the destinies of the world. Our policy
with respect to protection and free trade bas
been pretty much along the same sober lines;
we have rejected extreme doctrines in favour
of a moderate course-what might be described as a practical policy to "bring home
the bacon."
This mentality is characteristic of the Canadian people, and the prospect of the spread
of Communism, Fascism or Nazism does not
alarm me. A study of our history convinces
me that these isms will not take root in the
mental soil of Canada.
I have already said that I have no great
dread of the word "radical." After all, what
does the word mean but to go to the root
Hon. Mr. LEWIS.

of things? And was there ever a time in the
history of mankind when it was more necessary to go to the root of things? This being
so, even though we do not agree with their
ideas, we ought to be grateful to those who
are trying to find a way out of the jungle in
which we are now aimlessly wandering. Radical ideas are sometimes described as rash,
perhaps crazy. Let me press into service the
somewhat familiar visitor from Mars. He
would probably come to the conclusion that
our world is crazy already, for he would
wonder why millions of people should be
suffering famine and privation in the midst
of abundance of food and clothing and ample
shelter. He might well say, "However crazy
may be the various remedies suggested by
these wild theorists, they do not seem to me
any crazier than the present condition of
affairs-privation amidst plenty."
I approach the question of currency with
considerable timidity, for I do net profess
to understand its mysteries. Inflation, bimetallism, and the Douglas plan are regarded
by some persons as wild and erazy ideas.
But what could be more wild and crazy to
the ordinary mac than our adherence to the
gold standard? In effect, we dig gold out of
the ground in Canada or South Africa, and
then we put it into anotier Iole in New
York, Paris or London, where it is of about
as much use to mankind as if it were at the
bottoma of the sea.
It has absolutely no
stabilizing influence upon trade; it does not
prevent the wildest fluctuations in the price
of wheat and other commodities, nor in the
commoditv value of debts. Therefore, while
J am not enamoured of any of the new
monetary plans, I am not very much in love
with the present system.
It seens to me we ought to be grateful to
the Independent group in the other House.
They at least are trying te Icad us out of
the woods. If we lost our bearings in the
bush we should be grateful to any one who
might offer to guide us back to a place of
safety. We might net accept his offer; we
miglt even warn him not to go astray himself; but at least we would acknowledge his
goodwill.
I agree with the honourable member from
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) and the
honourable .member from Shediac (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) that it would do us no harm to
have in this House a few representatives of
the radical element. Those honourable senators who are very much opposed to radicalism are fighting its proponents at long range.
They regard those so-called extremists as vile,
sedition-working agitators, plotting the down-

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I presume it would

the company from advertising.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have recently
seen in the newspapers, as I am sure other
honaurable members have, advertisements
stating that individuals can borrow money
on their salaries or their effects. I think
these advertisements are bad, for tbcy tend
ta induce borrowing, possibly at excessive
rates', on the part of people who would be
better off if thcy tightened their belts.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Ail I bave ta say
ta the honaurable member is that everyone
probably would be better off by nlot barrowing, but some of us are compelled at times
ta get a loan. There are classes of people
in the community who borrow from $10,000
ta $100,000, and legal provision is made for
enabling these people ta get such sums.
There is anather class of aur citizens who at
times require boans of $100 ta $500, and it
is just as necessary that aur law should make
it possible ta accommodate them.
llight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The point
that realby bathers me is the one raised by
the honourable member from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) as ta the manner in which
these companies invite people ta do business
with them. In the street cars in Toronto I
have nuticcd advertisements whicb go so far
as ta, imply that Parliament supervises the
rates charged. The words used are, "«Rates
authorized by Parliament," or " Rates authorized by the Govcrnment of Canada, " or tao
that effect. Perhaps the honourable member
from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) would
agree ta an amendment, which of course
shoubd also be made in the charters of similar
companies already incorporated, farbidding
the publication of advcrtisements of that
kind. Thcy give the public a wrong impression, for on reading them the ordinary
persan thinks Parl-iament sees that the rates
charged are f air as between the company and
the borrowcrs, whereas this is nlot so. All
that we do is fix maximum rates.
I presume it would be fair for the coinpanies ta advertise that Parliament has set
a limit ta the rate they niay charge, or sainething ta that effect, so long as there is not
conveyed the impression that we protect a
borrower from being stuck. As a matter of
fact, ail these borrowers are stuck ta some
extent, and undoubtedby in many instances
they woubd wilbingly pay very high rates.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I quite agrec with the
remarks of the right honourable leader of the
House. I think that instead of incarporating
these companies by individual Acts it would
be much better ta have a general Act under
which. tbey would get their authority ta do
business. Then ail would be on the saine
basis. As we bave already passed tbree Acts
of the saine character as this Bill, perhaps
hanourable members niight consent ta this

understanding or in the hope that general
legislation gaverning the powers of ehese

there is no great departure in this Bibl from

only fair ta this company ta pass the measure,

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They can do business, except in chattel mortgages?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They can do
business anywhere in Canada, but in Quebec
they cannot deal in chattel mortgages.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Ilonourable gentlemen, on reading the Bill J find that this company would be subject to the provisions of the
Loan Companies Act, excepting certain sections therein. It seems to me, therefore, that
if the Bill is passed here it migbt be advisable
for our Banking Committee to call before it
officers of all the companies that have been
given charters similar to the one provided
for in this Bill, and ascertain what the practices
of the business are. Then if it is deemed
advisable, we can amend the Loan Companies
Act, whici covers then all. Section 6 of this
Bill reads:
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the
Loan Companies Act, chapter twenty-eight of
the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, excepting
therefrom paragraph (f) of subsection one of
section sixty-one, paragraph (c) of subsection
two of section sixty-one, subsection three of
section sixty-two, sections sixty-four, sixty-five,
sixty-six, sixty-seven, eighty-two and eightyeight, shall apply to the company.
There is no doubt that certain classes of
advertisements have a tendency to do a great
deal of harm. Of course, it is impossible for
Parliament to legislate absolute protection
against all risks, but we certainly can safeguard the public to some extent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Superintendent of Insurance bas supervision over the
Loan Companies Act, and the right honourable leader of the House could draw to his
attention the desire of the Senate that a
general clause be inserted in that Act to
prohibit certain kinds of advertisement.

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Senate went into Committee on Bill 22,
an Act to amend the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
On section 1-definitions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The purpose
of this Bill is to amend the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act so as to provide for
additional appointments of detective inspectors, sub-inspectors and assistant veterinary
surgeons; for pensions to widows and allowances to children of officers and constables
killed while in the performance of duty; and
for recognition of prior service of officers and
constables in any provincial police force in
respect to pension benefits; and to cover
duties of and offences by members of the
force.
It is intended that the prior service of those
members of the force who were formerly in
the provincial police service, 'but not at the
time of enlistment, shall be taken into account.
This is the only amendment entailing added
expenditure. Those members of the force
who were in the provincial police service
at the time its duties were taken over have
their pension rights protected by the terms
of the statute authorizing the transfer.
My memory goes back to a discussion of a
similar point in this House.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
It was on the
question of giving credit for service in South
Africa. The right honourable gentleman was
very much opposed to it at the time.

MARCIL 23, 1934
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Ye". I do
not know whether this is an analogous case,
but, as my honourable friend from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) knows, my course will
be entirely consistent in any event.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I will see that it
is.
Section 1 wýas agreed to.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3--appointments of constables,
trumpeters and buglers, etc.:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This section
provides for further grades and so forth.' I
understand it does not involve added expenditure.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill
whether it is the intention to put officers of
the Mounted Police in charge of cruisers and
other vessels of the Marine Section? I have
heard that drivers and officers of motor transport are compelled ta wear spurs because one
hundred years ago the drivers of horse--drawn
transportation worc similar equipment. I stili
feel as I felt last session with respect to the
very substantial increase orf this force . In
another place figures were given showing it
had grown to something like 2,700 men. A
S'ear or two ago the force was inecased by
the appointment of a large number of Customs preventive officers. I do not think these
men may be regarded as properly a branch of
the old Mounted Police.
I know the plans
formulated have been changed from time to
time, probably as a matter of expediency.
Now, it seems, the Commissioner is to be put
in charge af the Marine Section. I do not
understand the reason for this course.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If the honourable
gentleman thinks there is any prohahility of
the Mounted Police wearing spurs at sea, I
arn afraid someone has been pulling his leg.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: They have to ride the
waves, anyway.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The wearing of
spurs on board ship is contrary to the King's
Regulations. With respect to the increase in
the force, the honourable gentleman seeme to
have forgotten that in the past three or four
years the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
have taken over the policing of Saskatchewan,
involving an increase of 150 men; the poficing
of Alberta, calling for another increase of 125
men; and the poIicing of Manitoba and the
three Maritime Provinces. The force has also
taken over the preventive service both on land
and sea. These increased duties account for
74728-14à

the increase in strength.

Section 3 was agreed ta.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed to.
On section 6-offences hy others than coinmissîoned officers:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I know I
should he answering rather than asking questions,' but no doubt the honourable senator
behind me (Han. Mr. Griesbach) will he
able ta enlighten me with regard ta sec*
tion 6.
It provides that every member of the force,
other than a cammissioned officer, who is
charged with any ai a series ai offences "may
be forthwith placed under arrest and detained
in custody, ta be dealt with under the provisions of this part." Among the offences
is "(,c> intoxication, however slight." Why
"however slight"? Why attempt ta modify
"intoxication"?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Military law does
not define intoxication. A soldier is not forbidden ta drink liquor, but hc is forbidden
ta he under the influence of liquor. I have
sat on a number of courts-martial dealmng
with charges ai drunkenness. If the accused
was an officer the question, ta be found in
military Iaw, and always amusing ta everybody, was invariably put: "Was the accused
in a condition to command an escort ta the
Sovereign?" If the witness answered "Yes,"
the court-martial would find the accused was
not drunk.
In the Mounted Police force, however, the
offence ai intoxication has always heen treated
as different from what it is uinder military
law. A soldier may become quite intoxicated
without harrning anybody, and it is nat considered a grave offence; but since the organization ai the Mounted Police any member
found guilty of undue intoxication has been
dealt with very severely. In the old days
it meant instant dismissal, and I fancy the
penalty is the samne to-day. I do not know
how the authorities grade intoxication, but
farmerly, if a mounted policeman was charged
with being intoxicated, it was no defence for
hiim, to plead hie was only slightly intoxicated;
if hie was not ahsolutely normai hie wus out.
I think the intention is ta raise the standard
higher than ever.
Hon. Mr. MUJRDOCK: What regulations
govern a Mounted Police officer? The section
read by the right honourable gentleman covers
"every member of the farce, other than a
commissoned officer."
Hon. Mr. GRIESiBACH: What is involvred
there is the peculiar organization of the

SENATE
Mounted Police. They are not like soldiers
in barracks, but are scattered all over the
country in small detachments, and every
officer has a virtually independent command.
Consequently there is nobody to handle him.
If lie were a junior officer in barracks there
would be some senior officer who would deal
with him, by placing him under arrest, relieving him of his duties, and calling in
another officer to take his place. In the
Mounted Police almost every officer is in
charge of a district or a subdistrict, and an
inspecting officer goes around and, if necessary, disposes of the officer in question.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Under what
section?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not know;
but I can certify that there is ample provision, and that it has been acted upon.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What would happen
if a commanding officer got slightly intoxicated, or pretty full, or was abusive to one of
his subordinates, or withheld information, or
accepted a bribe or gratuity?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
charged with an offence.

He would

be

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: By whom?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It depends on the
nature of the offence. In the case of bribery
someone would make a complaint; and when a

complaint is made something must be done.
The system of inspection is very rigid, and
it is the duty of the superior to sec that his
subordinates bebave themselves, and to investigate any complaints made to him. All these
things mentioned here may be the subject of
complaint, as well as others which are not
specified.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I hope my honourable friend will not think I am complaining,
but I want to put a question as coming from
an uninitiated, ordinary fellow who does not
understand. H1e sees this language: "Every
memiber of the force, other than a commissioned officer, who is charged with"-and then
follows a whole page of offences. It would
appear as though tbat was intended to give
a commissioned officer carte blanche to do just
as be likes. I know that is not the case, but
it seems to me the language is unfortunate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This, of course,
is an amending Act. This section deals with
non-commissioned officers only. There is no
doubt that if a commissioned officer commits
an offence he will be subjected to discipline at
the hands of those above him. I cannot name
the section under which that is done. The
ion. Mr. GRIESBACH.

honourable gentleman will see, on looking at
the section, that the very portion he is inquiring about is exactly the same as it was
before. I will ask the honourable gentleman
to assume that there must be a section which
deals with the commissioned officers. Every
member of the force is responsible to the
officer immediately above him, and finally to
the Commissioner, General MacBrien.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
I am curious to
know the meaning of the words "every member of the force who is charged with" an
offence. Suppose a constable arrests a man
and that man charges him with "using cruel,
harsh or unnecessary violence," docs the constable have to be placed under arrest?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Maybe. The
man above him will have to use bis judgment.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8-time served with provincial
police force included for pension purposes:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I call attention to this section, which adds expense. The
following words are new:
Recognition of prior service in and time
served in any provincial police force with
which the Federal Government bas an agreement under section five of this Act, at the
tine of the officer's appointnent or reappoint-

ment, or subsequent to such appointment or
reappointment, nay lie ineluded in the tern of
service for the purpose of pension under this
part, provided the officer pays the amount
required by the Governor in Council.
This is certainly wortby of some consideration.
I remember a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
question was raised as to the transfer of any
fund to which such a man had contributed
wlien in the provincial service.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The officer
must have been out of the provincial service
or be would not come within the purview of
this amendment. If he was in the provincial
service up to the time of the transfer of that
service to the Mounted Police, he would be
taken care of by the transfer provision; and
that would be quite right, because he became
a member of the federal force involuntarily;
and he would have certain rights with respect
to pension and the like. But the case covered here is that of a man who had been a
member of a provincial force and left it
before it was absorbed into the Mounted
Police. The object of the amendment, as
I sec it, is to make it possible, for the purpose of pension, to include in the period of

MARCH 23, 1934
service with the Mounted Police the time
served in the provincial force. I understand
that there are seven cases that fall into this
category.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Did we not
last year reject a similar amendment?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
We did.
That is why I call' attention to this. The
amendment of last year included service
rendered fromn the time of the South African
War. I cannot become enthusiastic over the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Should we not
suspend consideration of this clause?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I cannot see that
this involves any expenditure. The officer is
required to make the payments that he would
have made had he continued in the other
service. In other words, h'e bas to place himself in good standing, and if he does that he
gets the pension.
The question of taking over these provincial police forces has been somewhat troublesone. The problemn was most acute in AIberta and Saskatchewan, which hard organized
forces from 1917. In those cases, I think, the
pension funds were ample. In the province
of Adberta the pension fund was sufficient to
provide for the men taken over into the
Mounted Police, as well as for those who took
their discharges. In the Maritime Provinces
there was no pension fund, and the force was
practically non-existent. This section provides
that 'the men must place thermselves in good
standing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But that
does not say that there is not some expense
to the treasury.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There will lbe.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course.
The same argument wo.ulld apply if we were
to enact that the time served years ago by a
man as town constable or as fireman ln some
town fire brigade should be 'ounted in the
esbimating of his right to a pension, now that
he is in the Mounted Police, provided he
pays the extra amouat required by the
Governor in Counceil. It is ail a question of
whether or not you arc going to signalize the
service of a man in a proviiial force in the
face of the fact that bis service with that
force hs been terminated and everything bas
been cleaned up. That man may have received an allowance for his service.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: He is now in the
Mounted Police.

213

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. He
says: "I served for a time with the Saskatchewan police. They were taken over. I am
ready to pay the amount required, and I
want that time counted." Really I cannot see
why it shoudd be nounted any more than if he
had served as a firemen or a dlerk in a store.
The service is all through and done with.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move to
strike out that clause.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Would there be many
such cases?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: About seven.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Should we, with
the amount of information we have, strike it
out? Would it not be better to reserve it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think so.
Section 8 stands.
Section 9 was agreed to.
On esection 10-pension to widow and allowance to children:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The pension
is paid to a widow during her lifetime, and
is, I believe, half the pension that would
have been received by her husband. The
allowance to children is paid until they are
sixteen years of age.
Section 10 was agreed to.
Section 11 was agreed to.
On section 12-time served with provincial
police force included for pension purposes:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That wiHi
have to stand.
Section 12 stands.
Seetions 13 and 14 were agreed to.

FURTHER CONSIDEREb IN COMMITTEE
The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 22, an Act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.-Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 8-time served with provincial
force included for pension purposes:
Last year we
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
rejected an amendment whieh was much
wider than this and would have authorized
counting for pension purposes any time served
by members of the Mounted Police in the
South African War. The present clause, while
somewhat narrower in its application, seems
to me te contain the same principle, for it
authorizes the taking into consideration'for
pension purposes of any time served in any
provincial police force. We have been told
that the amendment would apply to only
a few cases, but I should like to know
whether the principle involved is one that
we should adopt. On Friday last I moved
to strike out this clause. Can the right honourable leader now give me any further
information?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Before the right
honourable leader replies, I would offer a
few observations on this clause. We are net
proposing this amendment of our own volition, for it comes to us as a result of conditions over which we have not much control.
For a number of years various provinces maintained provincial police forces. For example,
Alberta and Saskatchewan each established
a force in 1917, during the war period, and
after the Mounted Police had been withdrawn.
Those two provincial forces in particular were
modelled upon the Mounted Police, with
which the people of that part of the country
were familiar. There were the same ranks,
the same avenues of promotion, and as far
as possible the same methods of training and
of performance of duties. In common with all
employers of police forces, these provinces
endeavoured to enlist young men of good
family, good education and good physique,
and held out as inducements a certain scale
of increasing rates of pay, appropriate conditions of work, openings for promotion,-in

MARCH 27, 1934
short, a life-long career, with adequate pension
on retirement. But some years later circumstances compelled the provincial governments
to depart from the policy of maintaining these
forces and to transfer their duties to the
'Royal Canadian Mounted Police. After it
had been decided to make the transfer the
provinces were faced with the question of
what to do with respect to their engagements
with men who had joined the forces on the
strength of the inducements I have already
mentioned. Naturally the provincial authorities were desirous that the terms of engagement should not be violated and that the
officers and men should not suffer by reason
of the change, and an agreement was made
with the Federal Government that as many
as possible of the members of the provincial
bodies should be absorbed into the Mounted
Police, without any alteration in the arrangement for pension on retirement. It was
provided that for pension purposes the time
served in the provincial forces would be
counted the same as time on the Mounted
Police.
These agreements were confirmed and are
being carried out with respect to the officers
and men who were transferred at the precise
moment when the absorption took place. The
clause before us is designed to cover the cases
of those men, not more than six or seven,
who were members of provincial police forces,
but for some reason, good and sufficient in
their own minds, were not taken over at the
same time as their colleagues. Shortly afterwards, the circumstances of these few men
having changedHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Were these men
in the employ of provincial governments at
the time of the general transfer?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They were in the
employ of provincial governments at the
moment of absorption, but for personal reasons
they were not transferred just then. I have
in mind the case of a man whom I know, who
at the time of the general transfer wouId
have been obliged to go from the northern
to the southern part of the province. His
children were attending school in Edmonton,
and he decided to return to civil life. He
received payment of the pension money standing to his credit. Afterwards conditions
changed, and he decided to enlist in the
Mounted Police. He and the other men whose
cases are under discussion, in order to secure
pension benefits, must pay into the pension
fund the sums which actuarially are due by
them. The pension fund of the Alberta provincial force was sufficient to make good the
back payments of all the men absorbed from

that force. The purpose of these two clauses
is to put the six men in the same position as
they wouId have been in if they had been
transferred with the provincial force and there
had been no break in their service. Section 8
deals with the men and section 12 with the
officers.
I have before me a memorandum of payments actually made by members of the
Alberta provincial police in order that they
might become eligible for the Mounted
Police pension rights. The sums paid vary
according to the rank and service of each
man.
Detective-sergeant with thirteen years' service, $2,690.25; sergeant with fourteen years'
service, $3,255.75; corporal with fifteen year'
service, $2,016; 'acting corporal with fourteen
years' service, $2,927.25; first-clase constable
with fifteen years' service, $2,193.75.
Honourable members will observe that the
amounts paid are substantial. What is required to be paid under these two sections
will approximate the figures I have given.
They are worked out on an actuarial basis.
May I again emphasize the fact that these
clauses are incorporated in the Bill at the
instance of the provincial governments,
which, having made certain express and implied promises to induce men to join their
respective police forces, now desire to protect those men. , I might give a homely
illustration of how the parties stand. A
decent man sells a horse, and to the decent
man who buys it he says: "Here is a good
horse. He is accustomed to being well
housed, well fed, well groomed and considerately driven. I hope you will treat him
in the same way." That is the attitude of
the provinces, and in effect they request that
by the enactment of these two sections the
men in question will be treated as they would
have been if they had remained in the provincial service.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What was the
gap between the time the men left the pro
vincial service and their enlistment in the
Mounted Police?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would be
five years in the case of members of the
Saskatchewan force.
Hon. Mr. GRIFBACH: The Saskatchewan provincial police were taken over two
years ago; the Alberta provincial police last
year.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In the taking over
of the provincial police services what is the
division of cost between the provinces and the
Federal Government?

216

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is a matter of
agreement. The Federal Government takes
over the policing of a province for a stated
sum per year.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: A lump sum?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: A lump sum.
the agreement with each provUnder
ince there is provision for some special
charges, such as the conveyance of prisoners
from the courts where sentenced to the jail
or penitentiary, as the case may be. Alberta
pays $280,000 a year. The Saskatchewan
payment is somewhat less.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: I was troubled
about this section last Friday, and I am not
wholly satisfied with it yet. The main purpose of the Bill, of course, is acceptable.
Honourable members may be assured that the
arrangements are economical both for the
provinces and the Dominion. Certainly no
province would give up control of its police
for any less meritorious reasons than those of
economy and efficiency. One sees at a glance
how this co-ordination of police work does
away witih duplication both of effort and of
organization. The first police force taken
over wa.s that of Saskatchewan, in 1928. In
1932 the Dominion entered into a similar
arrangement with the other provinces except
Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia-the
three provinces, curiously enougli, whiich still
insist on provincial insurance jurisdiction.
They are in the van, forefront, top story, of

provincial riglts.

were entitled, were now secking to lave that

service they previously were employed.

circumstances I am not disposed to press my
amendment to this clause. I quite realize
that this provision will bring about harmony

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, the
reason is, I presume, that the treasury is
not flooded with funds from the very meagre
vote of last year. This is just the usual
one-sixth. Instead of two bills there is but
one. One-sixth of the estimates applicable
to all departments and services is voted in
the usual course, pending the passing of the
final estimates.

Hon. Mr. TANNER moved the second

He said: Honourable members will .observe
the explanatory notes opposite the amending
section. Under the racing law of 1912 racing
associations may hold annually two meetings,
each of seven days' duration. The object of
the Bill is to give racing associations the
option to hold one race meeting of fourteen
days or two race meetings of seven days each
in any calendar year.
I am informed by the sponsor of the Bill
in the other House that the amendment bas
been submitted to the provincial governments
and they have no objection to it. The proposed change would not in any way affect the
amount of revenue the racing associations
pay to the provinces. I am further informed
that there is no objection to the Bill from
any other source.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The purpose
of the proposed amendment is as stated by
my honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner).
The main reason for the Bill is
that under the present practice it is impossible
to separate the Windsor and Detroit meetings and hold the Windsor meetings within
the statutory period. I was rather surprised
that the Bill passed the other louse unanimously, having in mind the celebrated debate
on this subject of twenty years ago.

That when the House adjourns to-day it do

1934, at 3 p.m.
The motion was agreed to.
BUFFALO AND FORT ERIE PUBLIC
BRIDGE COMPANY PETITION
On the motion to adjourn during pleasur-e:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: Honourable
senators, may I explain that prior to the
Royal Assent there will be further business, as
we shall have before us for consîderation
the Bill covered by the motion, which carried,
permitting reception of the petition with respect thereto. I refer to the Bill to ratify
the Peace Bridge agreement. I shall now
give the reasons why this House should dispose expeditiously of the measure, so that
honourable memnbers may be in a position to
make any objection they care to when the
Bill is properly before us.
By some oversight the petition was not
presented to this House in the regular way, at
the time it was presented to the other House,
although the solicitor for the bridge company
says the petition was sent here. The oversight was remedied this morning. The Bill
will be' brought before us this afternoon. The
plan is that wben the House adi ourns during
pleasure it should stand adj ourned until 4.30
p.xn. In the meantime the Committee on
Standing Orders can look into the regularity
of the petition, on which it must report favourably before the Bill can be introduced.
The Bill wouhd empower what is called the
Peace Bridge Authority, a public utility organization created by the State of New York, to
carry out a reorganization of the capital structure of the Peace Bridge Company, which
owns wbat is known as the Peace Bridge, connecting Fort Erie with Buffalo.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: On the
American side.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHiEN: From Fort
Erie on the Canadian side to, Buffalo on the
American side.
Formerly there were two -organizations.
The Canadian company, which owned the

219

property on the 'Canadian side, was created
by legisiation of this Parliament; the
American company, wbich owned the property
on the American side, was created by the
Legisiature of New York State. These two
concerns subsequently amalgamated, and a
company, which bereafter 1 shaîl refer to as
the bridge company, took over the stock of
both and tbereby became the owner of the
entire structure. Two bond issues were made
by the bridge company, one for some $2,300,000
at seven per cent-I may not be exactly rigbt
as to the amount-and the other for $1,050,000
odd at eight per cent. Then, in consequence
of contraction in revenue, due to difficuit
times, and of taxation imposed in the State
of New York and in the Dominion of
Canada, the company found itself in difficulties, tbough, I believe, the interest on the
bond issues bas been paid up to within a few
months of the present date.
The wbole proposition, as we ahl know, is
in the nature of a public service undd&taking.
The assets of the company, after the payment
of obligations, were to revert to the respective
states. When these difficulties appeared the
State of *New York passed Act No. 824 of the
last special session, creating a company called
the Public Utility Bridge Company, or some
such name, to take over the assets of the then
existing company, first securing the outstanding bond issues. Under an agreement made
with the bridge company, the utility organization was to issue its own bonds to a total
of $4,000,000, such bonds to be exchangeable
at par for the bonds held by the bridge company, and to bear interest at five per cent
instead of tbe seven or eight per cent of the
old issues.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Which. are soon
to mature?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No, not for a
considerable time. The rates of interest have
proven too oncrous for the bridge company
to sustain.
The'exchange agreement between the public
utility authority and the old company is
a most elaborate document and covers every
contingency. I1 have read it in detail and
think I can answer any question relevant to
it. In the main the agreement provides that
the bondholders, who become parties to it
by the mere fact of depositing their bonds
with the trust company, agent of the public
utihity company, shail get new bonds for an
amount equal to their holdings, together with
the small amount of interest which feil due
on the first of this year. -It was not then
paid; to that extent there was default. They

220

SENATE

arc also to receive a certain amount in cash
by way of a bonus for having exchanged high
interest bonds for bonds bearing a lower rate.
The amount of this bonus is $55 per $1,000 in
respect of the seven per cent bonds, and $30
per $1,000 in respect of the eight per cent
bonds. This exchange has already been taking
lace, and already $1,700,000 odd of the
$2,300,000 of seven per cent bonds, and
8800,000 odd of the $1,050.000 of eight per
cent bonds have been deposited.
These
amount to between seventy and eighty per
cent.
Under this plan it is necessary, of course,
that the non-depositing bondholders be taken
care of. Here 'I corne to the point where the
need of decision on the Bill at an early date
becomes apparent.
In order that the plan
might be carried out, notice of repayment was
given under teic mortgage trust deed in respect of both lte seven per cent and the
eiglt per cent issues. Under that notice the
public utility body lias to redeem at a certain premium, in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed, ail flic bonds net
deposiled. The notice in respect of the seven
per cent issue was given on the lst of January. and flic redemption must Iake effect
on Monday next. In respect of the eight per
cent issue lthe redemption is to take offect
at a verv early date, whicl I cannot recall
exactiy. Therefore nov delav in pas-ing this
Bill would result in a considerable los to
the company. As the House will perceive, if
the company cnn avail itself of tlie cotites
of redemption tiready given in regard to the
non-depoited bonds, if will fhereby save the
interest for the period between the end of this
week and the tinte when new notices would
mature.
Furthecrmore, the State of New
York lias entirely surrendered its riglt to
taxes in respect of the American end of the
property, but this surrender is dependent
upon our legislation being passed in time to
enable the company to take advantage of the
notices already given.
As the legislation
shortly to corme before us contains no corresponding surrender on the part of the Canadian authorities, Fort Erie will be able to
tax. I arn given to understand that there is
no reason te believe tiat this reserxation on
the part of Canada will result in tbe abandonment of the surrender now in effect in respect
of the State of New York. I mention the
matter only to show that if further delay
occurs the company will be facing considerable peril witlh regard to the New York
logislation and the exemption which it
provides.
I think I have made clear the principal
foatures of the measure. It romains necessary
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

to say only one more thing.

The contentious

feature has been, so far as I am aware,
entirely with respect to taxes, and this ha?
been resolved by reservation of the right to
tax, notwithstanding the fact that the Bill
provided and still provides that when and
as the bonds are discharged the ownership
of the property on the American side will
devolve upon the State of New York, and,
on this side of the border, upon the Dominion
of Canada. Thus the bridge, which is commemorative of one hindred years of peace,
becomes a really international possession.
Such is flic character of the measure whici
will lie considered by, the Committee on
Standing Orders as soon as the House rises,
and further dealt witi liore wlien we resume
this afternoon, if honourable members are
agreeable.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I am net opposing the expediting
of the Bill. Some years ago I took an interest
in this bridge, wlien our old friend the late
W. M. German was looking after te Canadian end, and mv recollection is ftat I had
a iuiber of consultations with parties
actively concerned in the undertaking. The
bridge is an international peace memorial,
and it would be a shame that anv act of
ours should interfore with the making of the
proposed settlement. To m- mind it is unfortunate that the project did not run into
better times, but it seemse be tlie Iuck
to
cf international bridges not to be very
su cce,sful.
Riglht Ilon. Mir. MEIGIIEN: This is the
lest of then I tiink.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes, I imagine
this is the best.
Tunnels and bridges, as
between Detroit and Windsor, have net
proved financially profitable. In the present
instance there are no private persons interestetd except those who have taken up bonds.
The emuergency that exists is a real one, and

J s1e no reason why we should not accede
to tlie riglht honourable leader's suggestion
to expedite te Bill. I am alway- in favour
of shutting my eyes to the Rulks when a
genuine ncoessity for so doing is shown, as
in this case. But when we are dealing with
ordinary mensures, like race meet bills, for
example, I felt it is well to -observe the Rules.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After somte tit

the sitting was resumed.

PRIVATE BILL
FIRST READING

Bill M, an Act to amend an Act to incorporate the Discount and Loan Corporation
of Canada.-Hon. Mr. Marcotte.

MARCH 28, 1934
PRIVATE BILL-BUFFALO AND FORT
ERIE PUBLIC BRIDGE COMPANY
FIRJST READING,

A message was received from the House of

Commons with Bill 13, an Act respecting the
Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Company.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN, with the consent of the House, rnoved the second reading
of the Bill.
He said: Before the adjournment I took
occasion to outline the Bill and the circumstances under which it is brought before us.
The promnoters being desirous that it be passed
before the Easter adjournment, I protested
against the late bour at wbich the measure
comes to us. The reason for the dehay is the
proionged consideration which the other House
gave the Bill in committee. As a result very
important amendments bave heen made,
which, so far as I can see, render the Bill unobjectionable. I bave devoted considerabde
time to a study of the amended Bill and of
the history behind it. The right honourahie
senator fromn Eganvihie (Right Hon. Mr. Gra-

ham) was very ciosehy associated witb the
projeet in its earlier stages. I believe it bad
its birth about 1923. At the moment I need
oniy add that the Bihl provides for adequate
representation of the Dominion on the dirc-

torate. It is not onIy a public utility body,
it is really an international body which bas
charge of the enterprise.

We must have repre-

sentation on the board of directors to make it
effective and to give us that measure of control to which we are entitled. Beyond this I

do not think we can assert any riglit.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I amn sure the rigbt
honourable leader of the House (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) hehieves this Bill is entirely
in the interest of economy and protective of
the rigbts of those who shouid be protected;
but it seemns to me there is a great deal of
unseemhly baste in this procedure. I arn toid
that hast night the ruies in another place were
suspended in order that the Bill might be
rushed tbrougb. Now, within a few minutes
of the arrivai of the Deputy of the Governor
Generai we are asked to give the measure
second and third readings. The legal gentleman in charge of the Bihl phaced in my hands
a brief on behaif of its promoters. I do not
know wby hie presented the brief to me uniess
hie tbought I was likely to take exception to
the mea.sure.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.

221

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That may be the
reason. I notice these two paragraphis in the
brieýf:
The town of Fort Erie has made very few,
if any, improvements or expendîtures on
account of the bridge, and has received since
the bridge opened to the end of 1933 the sum
of $344,438.07 in taxes and will receive its
taxes for the year 1934.
Fort Erie now seeks to defeat this Bill, or
to have attached thereto a provision for
taxation.
It is only fair to say that the gentleman
who handed me this brief tells me that Fort
Erie bas been fixed up. However, in my

opinion, in order that we may knýow more
about wbat bas heen done, the Standing ýCommittee on R-ailways, Telegrapbs and Harbours
should have an opportunity to investîgate al
the circumstances. If the Bill is flot disposed
of to-day its promoters may be put to. a
great deal of expense. Wel1, it will he just
too bad. During the session I have listened
to several eloquent speeches by distinguished
senators reciting the many stepe taken by
this Chamber to proteet the public interest.
1 may be entirely wrong, but I do not see
bow the Senate of Canada can protect the
public interest by accepting a Bill of this
kind, submitted to us at 3 o'clýock on tbe
afternoon of Wednesday, March 28, and passing it, in the short interval lef t to us before
uhe Deputy of tbe Governor General attends
bere to give Royal Assent. Unless I receive
some substantial assurance, I must object to
any sucb burry-up procedure.
We complain of tbe lack of legisiative work.
At times we bear a good deal about reformation or abolition of the Senate. Naturaliy we
are strongly opposed to sucb proposais. Today I saw two or tbree senators--I bave seen
them on other days, too--come here, get
their O.K. before the Orders of the Day
were called, and then hurry off to catch the
3.30 train. Yet we talk about the Senate
being given more work to do!l I think it is
pretty nearly time we protested with firmness
and dignity against this unseemly haste. I
realize delay m-ay involve the promoters of
the Bill in considerahie expense, but, if so,
I repeat, it is just too bad.
Another thougbt. I see it is intended by
the Bill to reduce to 5 per cent the interest
rate on certain bonds now paying 7 per cent
and 8 per cent. I arn ail for that. But
let us not, pick on the bondholders of one
bridge company; let us run the whole gamut
of indebtedness and help the people of
Canada by reducing ail bond interest to a
reasonable bank rate of two and a haif per
cent.

Hon. Mr. LITTLE:

This is a beginning.

222

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. Let us do
that and so get more money to carry on the
affairs of the Dominion. As a member of this
House I shall object most strenuously to any
further action to-day unless I am assured that
the public interest will not be prejudiced by
the passing of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I shall confine my observations to
the Bill and try to answer what appears to
be the difficulty in the mind of my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). The brief from which he quoted was
also handed to me, but I received it too late
to read it. Its contents, however, I think I
already know. It states that Fort Erie was
objecting to the measure on the score of
taxation. The town thought that if, so far
as Canada is concerned, this bridge became
the property of the Crown it would be
exempt from taxation. The whole theory of
the measure is that the company rights in
Canada shall be the property of the Crown
as soon as the debt is paid. Fort Erie pressed
this objection strongly before the Committee
of the other House, and I am informed that
a lengthy battle was waged over it. As the
story is given to me, Fort Erie's contention
was implemented by amendment, and as the
honourable gentleman will sec, the Bill now
distinctly provides that there shall be no
special treatment of the bridge company with
respect to taxation in Canada. In a word,
the town's right of taxation remains. I am
net aware that there is any other contentious
feature in the measure.
As to reducing the rate of interest, the
thought in the honourable gentleman's mind
apparently is that if we are reducing the rate
we should make the reduction apply generally.
I presume he means in relation to the bonded
indebtedness of the country. This is not
such a measure as many persons in Canada
seem to think it the duty of Parliament to
enact, for the arbitrary reduction of the rate
of interest. The fact is that the bridge company cannot pay its bonded interest out of
present earnings. Consequently an arrangement was made under which the old conpany was permitted voluntarily to exchange
its bonds for 5 per cent bonds of a new
company, the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public
Bridge Authority, created in the first place
by legislation of the State of New York,
now supplemented by legislation of Canada.
There is nothing compulsory in the proposed
legislation. The holders of these securities
can come under the arrangement or net, as
they like. As a matter of fact, somewhere
between 70 and 80 per cent of the bondholders have voluntarily exchanged their
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

securities for the new 5 per cent bonds.
Those who do not do so are not being treated
arbitrarily at all.
They have been given
notice of repayment of the old bond issue,
and they will get their money at the expiration of the notice, which in the case of the
7 per cent issue expires next Monday.
Now, it is superfluous to say that I have
not the slightest personal interest in the Bill.
I have had no association whatever with the
promoters. But, as a citizen, I do net like
to sec a company which has for its purpose a
public object harshly treated. It is not a
private concern operating with a view to
profit. There is no possibility of profit except to the Dominion on the one hand and the
State of New York on the other.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I say a word?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: They benefit
at the time the bonds are paid, and not before.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Unfortunately
have not a copy of the Bill.

I

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It has been
distributed. At least I have a copy. The
Bill itself is short, only four pages. The other
nine pages contain a reprint of the New
York statute creating the new bridge
authority. I have very carefully read every
clause of the Bill. If this were a Bill projected by a private party with a view to
profit, and of such an extraordinary character
as not to come within the Companies' Act,
the request for haste on the part of this House
would come with far less grace than it does
now. It is really a Bill under which the
Dominion of Canada and the State of New
York are the only parties, persons, corporations, or interests which can receive any
advantage. The bondholders do not get any
advantage, except possibly those who are
being paid off because they refuse to take a
lower rate of interest. I presume the measure
is of some advantage to them. But it is an
advantage they can enforce; it is not an
advantage we are giving them.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They are just
carrying out their contract.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are just
carrying out their contract.
The point I was making was this. This is
not a measure declaring that contracts are
invalid and interest rates are reduced by force
majeure of legislation; it is merely one of
those steps taken in time of depression and
adversity between the debtor who cannot
pay, on the one hand, and the creditor who
cannot be paid on the other. It is one of
those adjustments that follow when debts

.223

MARCH 28, 1934
that are piled too high are dissolved in bankruptey or hy rearrangement and compromise.
That is all it is.
I do nlot want ta take too much responsibility upon myseif, but 1 think that when,
by reason of delay. an exigency arises and a
company is threatened with ]iability for a
large amount of interest, and is imperilled in
respect of a large amount of taxation, you
should weigh carefully the responsibility you
would be assuming in forcing those penalties
upon it. Furthermore, you shauld remember
that the ultimate beneficiaries are the respective states eoncerned, not private individuals.
We cannot, against the wish of any single
member of this House, put this mensure
through before five o'clack; that can only be
donc by unanim-ous consent; and I know
honourable members, including the hanourable member fromn Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock), will fully realize the responsibility
they would be assuming in carrying the
measure over. If there is any further question
ta be asked, or if there is anything I have
not answered satisfactorily, I shall try again.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Docs it flot amount
ta practical expropriation?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, fia.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let me read sections 9 and 10. The side note ta section 9
rends:
Comptroller of the Treasury ta act.
The section is as follows:
Wherever in the Act of Incorporation of
the Bridge Authority provision is made for the
designation of an authority by the Dominion
of Canada, such authority shall, exeept as
otherwise provided herein, be the Comntroller
of the Treasury of the Department of Finance
of Canada.
The side note ta section 10 is:
When bonds discharged.
The section reads:
When all of the bonds issued by the Bridge
Authority shahl have been paid in f ull, or shal
have otherwise been discharged, the powers,
jurisdiction and duties of the Bridge Authority
shaîl cease-and the property acquired and held
by it within the Dominion of Canada shal
become the property of His Majesty the King
and shalh be under such jurisdiction, authooeity
or ageney as the Governor in CounciI shal
designate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is rîglit.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I had received the
impression fram another sour'ce that the bonds
had been practically taken care of, or that
it lad been agreed ta exehange the seven or
eight per cent bonds for five per cent bonds.
Does the right honourable gentleman know
anything about that?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I explained
that before.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: He said that this
afternoon.
Right Thon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The first issue
of seven per cent bonds was, I th'ink, something over $3,000,000. It bas now been reduced ta $2,500,000. 1 gave the figure $2,300,000 be-fore, but I find I was nlot accurate in
that. The eight per cent issue lias been reduced ta $1,050,000. Now, the burden af intercet, accompanied as it is by taxation, proving too heavy, the State of New York ineorporates a public bridge authority and enables
that authority ta issue bonds ta a total of
34,000,000, at five per cent, if neicessary, and
pravides that the holders of the seven per
cent and eiglit per cent bonds of the company
which up ta now bas been operating may
exchange themn voluntarily for new bonds. In
each case the bondholders get a certain
amount of cash-interest ta the end of the
year, and a sumn in lieu of extra interest, but
by na means equal ta it, and thus a saving
of about 385,000 a year in interest is effected.
Already, even though the measure before us
has nat ye-t become law, between seventy and
eighty per cent af the bondholdeýrs of the two
classes have valuntarily depasited their bonds
with the trustee, and bonds are stili comilng in.
But when the notice expires there will stil
be bonds which have nlot corne in, and the
holders of the seven per cent bonds who have
nlot deposited themi wiil be paid off on Monday next, and the halders of the eight per cent
issue a short time lateT--Saturday, I think.
Unless this legisiation passes, the notice
given ta the recalcitrant bondholders, or the
non-depasiting bondholders as they are called,
will have no effeet, because they cannat be
paid off; therefore notice would have ta be
given again, and the seven per cent and the
eight par cent would have ta continue ta be
paid until the next notice expired. This is
the loss that the new public authority would
sustain. And who would be losing? It would
be the Dominion of Canada and the State
of New York, because they hecome the ultimate owners and any additional moneys paid
ta the bondhalders, or for any purpase whatsaever, really became a mortgage against the
residuary interest of the twa states in the
praperty.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM- I suppose the
five per cent bonds are long-term bonds?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Right Han. Mr.
mighty good rate.

GRAHAM:

Yes.

SE'NATE

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN-\: There is no
right of ominent domain, no right of expropriation, c-xercised at aIl. Clause 9 of the
Bill is neccssary bocause the legislation of the
State of New York makes provision for the
filing of certain documents with someone ini
the Dominion who is authorized to receive
them, and this is the clause dosignating that
person.
Then the Bill provides that on payment, of
the issue the propcrty which the company
owns shahl be conveyed to and bccome the
property of the Dominion of Canada and the
State of New York. That, is not expropriation. The wvholo original intent and purpose
of the organization xvas that the property
should become international, each state owning its part as soon as the money that had
to be raised to construet it had been paid
back to thiose who provided it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: During the reccss
the promoter of this Bill came to my office
and told me, as I statod before, that this
Biii hiad heen put through in another place
last nig-lit. May I ask the righit hionourable
gentleman whether the Covernment and those
in anothier place considered this Bihl as of
such great, urgcncy that it had to ho rushed
through yestorday?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Govern.
ment, i0 so far as I have communicated wvith
any member of it-and I have cummunicated
with the Prime Minister lias precisely the
same vicws that I have sought to express to
this House: that it is worth whiloe Vo have
the legislation, and worth whule to save the
monoy of the company, if possible, by having
the legislation passed now. 0f courso the
Goveroment lias no0 interest in it that this
House lias flot. 1 do not think the Bill was
rushed through the other House, unless it
was in the final stages. There bas been quite
a battie about it; but my information is
that the battie raged entirely around the
question of t axation, and that the Bill ias
amended to provide that so far as Canada
is eoncerned the property could ho taxed. I
know the Bill was under consideration as far
back as two or three weeks ago, because I
was spoken to about it then. I do flot want
any honourable member to get the idea thiat
any private inte.rest is being served here. If
it is, I know nothing of it.
Riglit Hon. GEORGE'P. GRAHAM- The
origin of this whole seheme was international.
Manvy meetings were lield, and on both sides
of the line the proleot was regarded as a good
une. The chief difference between this undertaking and most others of a similar kind is
R.ight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

the agreement that, the property is to revert
to the Vwo countries concernied when the debts
are paýid. There is no private profit in it for
anybodv, with the exception, perhaps, of
those who are to ho paid off immediately.
What is proposed is just the reverse of confiscation, and my objoct in endeavouring to
expedite the Bihl is to protect the original
ar-rangement, whereby, at such time as the
debts and liabulities are discharg-ed, the property shail lie taken ont of the hands of the
bondhoidýers and come into the possession of
Canada and the State of New York.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

voi- ahi 0 and clear speech, as well as that

Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae).
If this

APRIL 11, 1934
amendment means anything, it means that
every little school-house and every college
or university from one end of the country to
the other can caim a share of whatever
moneys may be allocated to educational institutions under this Bill. It was my clear and
definite understanding that its main object
was to establish sweepstakes for hospitals
and charitable institutions only. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), in introducing the word "educational," would bring
in agnicultural colleges and schools of all
kinds. I am quite sure that such is net the
desire of the people of Canada, and that those
who are in favour of sweepstakes believe the
Bill to be solely for the benefit of hospitals
and charities. Therefore I cannot too strongly
object to. the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is in errer when he says the Bill
allows the proceeds of sweepstakes to go to
hospitals and charitable institutions. It says
nothing of the kind; it refers only to
hospitals. If the honourable gentleman proposed to add charitable institutions, that
would be an extension of the Bill just as much
as the proposal of the honourable senator
from Montarville.
As to the point of order may I say that I
do not think it is well taken, inasmuch as the
principle of the Bill is to establish sweepstakes. That being se, I hold the same view
as the honourable senator from Montarville,
that the amendment does net affect the principle of the Bill, but merely makes the funds
raised available to institutions other than
hospitals.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) asked for the
rule. It is rule 74, which says:
No arguments are admitted against the
principle of a Bill in Committee of the Whole.
My point is that the principle was clearly
and fuily discussed upon the second reading
of the Bill and that the proposal now before
us would radically and materially enlarge
upon and change the principle that we
approved.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Speaking to the point
of order, I quite agree that the matter is
debatable, but it seenis to me that the position taken by my honourable friend to my
left (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) is correct.
A bill contains, as a rule, one main principle and a number of important details. It
seems to me we should not take the attitude
that the Committee of the Whole cannot
change any of those details. In the present
instance the position, briefly stated, is this.
74728-15J

227

We have voted in favour of the principle of
sweepstakes or lotteries. As I think my
honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) will agree, that is the main idea
behind the measure. Heretofore sweepstakes
have nct been legal in Canada, and it is now
proposed to. make them legal. If we decide
to have sweepstakes we must also pass upon
a number of points of detail-to what purposes the receipts from the sweeps shall be
devoted, who is to determine whether there
shall be sweeps in any province, and so on.
It seems to me unreasonable to contend that
we cannot provide for these and other details
as we desire.
For example, the Bill provides that if sweepstakes are authorized in any province they
shall be under the' control of the AttorneyGeneral of the province. I think my honourable friend from Parkdale will agree that we
voted on that point, as well, when we passed
the second reading. But would any person
hold that we could not change that provision
and substitute some other official or authority
for the Attorney-General? Not at all.
Similarly, the Bill provides that certain
proceeds from sweepstakes shall go to hospitals, and my contention is that the Conmittee can make a change in this provision
also. I remember that last session the honourable member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) stated he would prefer to have
sweepstakes for the benefit of charitable institutions as well as hospitals, but he preferred
not to widen the scope of the measure at
that time.
While I admit there is an argument in
favour of the contention of the honourable
gentleman fron Parkdale, I doubt that the
amendment is an attack upon the real principle of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend interests me very much. May I ask
if he would please carry his argument a little
further and discuss the title of the Bill-"An
Act with respect to Hospital Sweepstakes"and then go to section 1, where the short title
is given as "Hospital Sweepstakes Act"?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: These matters do not
invalidate my contention. We are quite at
liberty to change the title as well as any
detailed provisions of a bill. I think I made
myself quite clear. We voted upon only one
main principle, that we should have sweepstakes.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I think the actual principle of the Bill is outlined in the title, as the
honourable senator from Parkdale says.
Furthermore, section 2 not only makes provi-

SENATE

sion for the authorization of sweepstakes in
-any province, but limnits the purpose of the
sweepstakes to "raisin- money for the benefit of one or more hospital or hospitals within

FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The ýSenate again avent into Committee on
the Bill.

Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Beaubien was negatived: contents, 28; noncontents, 28.
I would ask the
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
riglit honourable leader of the House if a
scoator may refrain from voting, and not give
any reason therefor?
Righit Hon. Mr. 'MEIGHEN: In ýmy judgment, the vote being a tic, when the Chairlest, bis
man declares the amendment
doclaration is equivalent to n vote against the
amendment.

Section 2 was agreed to.
Sections 3 and 4 were agreed to.
On section 5-advertising:
I have a few
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACGH:
observations on this section and section 6.
WThen the principie of the Bill n'as being discussed we heard a good deal about the profits
derived froma sweepstakes. In the course of

APRIL 11, 1934
his speech on that occasion the honourable
gentleman from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) etated the general expenses were estimated at 6-69 per cent, and other honourable
gentlemen who took part in the debate were
of opinion that the administration cost was
no higher than eleven per cent. Before we
pass these two clauses it might be well to
consider some aspects of the operation of
sweepstakes which have corne to my knowledge.

The Irish Hospitals Sweepstake tickets axe
issued in books containing twelve, priced at
$2.50 each, or $30 for a book. I am advised
that in Canada the selling organization consists of a Dominion manager, a provincial
manager, and local salesmen. On each book
the salesman's commission is two tickets, or
the equivalent of $5; the provincial manager
is given one ticket; the Dominion manager
is paid a bonus or salary or rake-off of $1.50
a book. It will be seen that before any
money reaches the Irish Hospitals Trust the
sum of $9, or 30 per cent, bas been spent to
effect the sale. The net return of $21 is
divided among the member-hospitals after
the cost of administration and the prize
money are deducted.
In the debate to which I have referred very
definite statements were made, based on the
report of reputable auditors, that the cost
of management was in the neighbourhood of
11 per cent. But the attention of the Committee should be directed to the fact that
this percentage is figured on the net proceeds
after payment of the 30 per cent ticket-selling
cost.
It may be wondered why it is necessary to
pay such liberal commissions. The answer
will be found in the statement of some honourable gentlemen that a substantial proportion of the -proceeds of the Irish Sweepstakes
comes from the sale of tickets elsewherein the United States. Sweepstakes are the
prey of every crook in the world. Whenever
a sweepstake is operated some new form of
rascality is devised, and the promoters have
to safeguard themselves against a repetition
of the swindle; a precaution which involves
expense. The wider the scope of the sweepstake, of course, the larger the number of
crooks to be outwitted. For instance, tickets
and receipts must be printed on specially
water-lined paper, otherwise they will be
counterfeited. This paper costs 56 cents a
pound in three-ton lots. There being no
stamp tax in the United States, all cheques,
post office orders and express orders received
from that country have to be stamped by
the Hospitals Trust, and this alone represents
a substantial expense.

229

Recently crooks have contrived a very
clever fraud. Tickets are printed in sheets
of 16, and each ticket has to be numbered
separately. A scheme that I heard of for
beating the game is as follows. The printer
is paid a substantial bribe to pass out a
block of sixteen tickets. These tickets disappear, and come into the hands of the men
who are manipulating the scheme. They wait
until the result of the sweepstake is announced, when they print the winning number
on one or more tickets which they send in
to the management. As the reputation and
the success of the business are involved, the
management has to pay. There is no escape.
To beat that particular game you must have
specially made numbering machines unlike
any others on the market, and these machines,
of which you must have fifty or sixty for one
sweep, and which you have to scrap after
every sweep, cost $125 apiece.
Those are some of the items which add to
the cost of sweepstakes and account for the
eleven per cent for nanagement, which is
admitted. But the eleven per cent is applicable only to the seventy per cent that comes
to hand, the other thirty per cent having
gone before the audit is made.
Sweepstakes have been prohibited in England because of the large sums of money which
were going out of the country in connection
with the Irish sweepstake, and some time ago
the Duke of Atholl, who undertook to put on
a sweepstake in aid of English hospitals, and
who succeeded in collecting a large sum of
money, was arrested and fined £25 for participating in an illegal transaction. Here is what
he said:
Our expense in connection with the sweep is
only thirty-three per cent. The only real basis
of comparison is the Irish sweepstake. We
are a very much smaller show, but our expense
is thirty-three per cent as compared with their
fifty per cent. They do not show it, but it
cannot be less.
If the audited expenses are eleven per cent,
and, as I have told you, the initial expense is
thirty per cent, the total is close to forty per
cent.
I am not so much worried about the
moral aspect of sweepstakes, on which a
great deal has been said on both sides, as I
am about certain other features. The gambling instinct is in most of us; most people
will take a chance. I do not see much difierence between sweepstakes and ordinary stock
market speculations, or between running a
sweepstake and refinancing an old business.
As a matter of fact, in my opinion, the
morality is all on the side of sweepstakes as
regards actual results in the past. We know

230

SENATE

that many malefactors of great wealth live
in fine bouses and drive big cars and so on,
and that they are not a bit more respectable
than the operator of a reputable sweepstake.
So far as taking chances is concerned, there
is probably not a man in this House who has
net a big bundle of stock certificates which
ho bought in the hope of making a fortune,
and which he still has, and will hand on to
his heirs, executors and assigins when he goes.
But what I want to bring out is this.
Many people who have supported this Bill,
and support sweepstakes in general as a
method of raising money, entertain entirely
erroneous views as to the expenditure involved and are quite ignorant of the constant
assaults that are being made by the crooks,
in all the countries in which sweepstakes are
carried on, with a view to defeating the
schemue and stealing fron its funds. People
do not know how muCh it costs to float such a
scheme and make it go, or the comparatively
small amount that is derived from it for
charitable objects. It is truc that enormous
sums of money can be raised by this method,
but surely the cost ought to be charged up
against it.
I thought it desirable to place this information on Hansard for the benefit of those
who really think that yo can finance great
institutions, or pay off the national debt,
by means of sweepstakes and lotteries. I venture to assert that such a proposition is net
sound business. It is all very well for those
who can afford it to take a flyer, but to
inaugurate a policy of sweepstakes for the
raising of money, or for the support of institutions which a province itself ought to support, is in my humble opinion highly unsound and unworthy of the civilization that
we are trying to build up in this country.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question? Was the
honourable member in possession of all these
facts a year or two ago when he sponsored
a similar measure in this House?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It might have
occurred to the honourable gentleman that
I speak with some authority on the subject.
I am giving him and the House the benefit
of my experience. The institution for which
I spoke last year is one that has been very
well conducted, as such things go-the most
honestly conducted of its kind that anybody
knows of. The work is donc largely by
volunteers, and the moneys gathered in have
been spent on veterans' charities, of which I
have a pretty intimate knowledge, and
prinarily for the benefit of the wives and
Hon. Mr. GRIESnACIL

children of ex-soldiers who, by reason of the
rigidity of pension and other laws, receive no
recognition at all from the country. In the
last six or seven years the veterans raised and
expended about 81,500,000, and, they had
reason to believe that they would secure an
amendment to their charter which would
permit them to operate legally. They were
entirely misled as to the feelings of the
Country. They thought the people were in
favour of their method of doing this work,
and asked me to bring in a Bill to amend
their charter; which I did. If bonourable
gentlemen will look up the speech I made at
that time they will see that I put before the
House the nature of the work being done
and the benefits being conferred upon a great
many helpless people. I supported the
amendment to the Act of incorporation. The
House voted it down. I have no fault to find
with that decision. I did what I was asked
te do. I suppressed nothing and concealed
nothing. I am just giving furtherHon. Mr. LACASSE: I think this is more
of an apology than a justification.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I rise to a point
of order. I did not wish to interrupt the
honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach), because hc was unwell when
this Bill was up for second reading, and missed
the opportunity to express his views upon
it. At his request 'I postponed it from time
to time so thît he might have an opportunity
to make his remarks. But I would call attention to the fact that the question b'efore the
Chair is section 5, and I submit that this
discussion is out of order.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
I acknowledge
my indebtedness to the honourable gentleman
for having this measure stand over. I thought
I was in order under section 5, or, if not under
section 5, then under section 6.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The honourable sonator from Edmonton has given us considerable information which I think we all find
very interesting. Speaking for myself, I may
say that I do, particularly the explanation
of the set-up for the sale of tickets. I am
net quite certain of my groundHon. Mr. BARNARD:
1 would ask a
ruling on my point of order, Mr. Chairman.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: Did I understand
the honourable gentleman from Edmonton to
say that it cost forty per cent to conduct
this sweepstake?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

There is a point

APRIL 11, 1934
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The point is tbat
I was out off order?
Hon. Mr. BAiRNARD: The question was
on sections 5 and 6, which relate solely to
advertising and the sale of tickets outside off
the Dominion. This discussion. is on the
principle off the Bill.
The Hon. the CHAIRM AN: 1 amn of the
opinion that the point of order is well taken,
but having permitted the honourable senator
from Edmonton to go onHon. Mr. HARDY: I just wanted ta ask
the honourable gentleman from Edmonton if
this committee which the Irish sweepstake
set up was a regular bureau selling these
tickets openly. The bonourable senator explaincd the make-iip off the committee. I
was wondering wbetber the 'Criminal Code
permits the open sale of tickets off tbis kind,
and, if not, wby tbis commîttee was allowed
to operate so openly. Pcrhaps the banLourable
gentleman can give same explanation. If it
is not allo'ved to work openly, tben it bas
been carrying on in direct contravention of
the Criminal Code.
Hýon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I did not speak
of any committee; I merely gave the names
arbitrarily. Tbere is an individual wbo corresponds to a Dominion manager-eaul him anytbing you like; there is another individual

openly.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Then tbey are operating illegally.
Hon. Mr. GRÂIESBACH:
Oh, yes. But
you are confronted by the situation that tbe
public generally do not abject. There is a
genuine intcrcst in tbe matter. Someone bas
said here tbat if you could search the pockets
of bonourable members of this House at any
given time you would be surprised at the
number* of sweepstake tickets you would find.
Tbat is probably true. It is truc of any body.
The question is as to tbe enforcement of tbe
law. Nobody complains or says anything
about it.
Section 5 was agreed to.
On section 6-agents outside off Canada:
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable senator from Victoria (Hon. Mr.
Barnard) if lie thinks section 6 is a proper
anc for the Senate of Canada ta pass, mnasmuch as the sale of lottery tickets in tbe
United States is illegal? In effeet this section
says, "Nothing in this Act shall prevent the
sale off tickets in tbe United States."

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: It does flot say
sa.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is what it
means. The section reads:
Nothing in this Act shall prevent the sale
outside of Canada by the Comnmittee or its
agents authorized in writing so ta do, of
tickets for sweepstakes as autborized ta be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of
this Act.
It does not say in sa many words that nothing shall prevent the sale of tickets in the
United States, but that is exactly wbat it
means. Does the Senate want ta subseribe ta
anything off that kind?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I would say in
reply ta, the honourable gentleman tbat I arn
flot in the least worried about tbe marais af
the United States. The people there can very
wcll look after themselves. If it is illegal ta
sell tickets in that country, let tbe authoritics there attend to tbe enfarcement off their
law. We bave bhad enough off tbat kind of
thing. I remember tha-t a fcw years ago
this Government, at a sacrifice off millions off
money, legislated ta probibit tbc sale off
liquor ta the United States. We might as
well bave bad the moncy, because tbey gat
the liquor.
ýHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Do you not think
this would be an unfriendly act towards a
fricndly nation?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: No.
Section 6 was agreed ta.
Section 7 was agreed ta.
On section 8-Criminal Code not ta apply:
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I wish ta add as
subsection 2 off tbis section a provision taken
from tbe Irish Act. It reads:
Tbis Act shall remain in force until the lst
day of January, 1939, and shall then expire.
Tbis legislation i.s in the nature off an experiment, and unless Parliament secs fit ta renew
it at the end off five years it will go by the
board. I move this amcndment at tbe sugges9tion off several honourable gentlemen on
bath sides off the House. I think it is pcrhaps
a wise provision.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That praviso
would flot prevent Parliament from repealing
the Act at any tirne?
Some Han. SENATORS: No.
The proposed amendment was agreed ta.
Section 8, as amended, was agrecd ta.
The preamable and the title were agreed ta.

HOSPITAL SWEEPSTAKES

BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BARNARD moved the third
reading of Biih A, an Act with respect to
Hospital Sweepstakes.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators, I move in amendmcnt that this Bill
be flot now read a third time, but be amended
by inserting after the word "hospitals" in
section 2, line fifteen, the words "educational
and charitable institutions."
Hon. Mr. TAiNNER:
The honourable
gentleman should have given notice of that
amendment.
Ilt should be on the Order
Paper.
Hon. Mr. CASGR.AIN: No, flot on the
thiird reading.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The sarne arnendment
was moved yesterday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is a public bill. ýIt is flot neccssary to give notice
of an amendment to be moved on motion
for third reading of a public bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In amendment
to the motion of the honourable genator
îrom Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) it is
moved hy the honourable senator from
Repentigny ('Hon. Mr. Rainville), seconded
by the honourable senator from. De Lorirner
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), Vhat the Bill be not
now read a third time, but be amended by
inserting in the fifteenth line, section 2, after
the words "hospital or hospiýtals" the words
"educational and charitable institutions."
Hon. R. DANDURAjND:
Honourable
members, I desire to, expinin the opinion
which I intend to express when the vote is
taken. For a long time-1I should say thirtyfive years-I have consistently vo-ted against
the principle of lotteries. As I have said on
more than one occasion, I was responsible
in 1899 or 1900 for the abolition of art
lotteries by a Criminal Code amendment
which was passed in this Chamber and, after
a long debate, in the other House as weIl.
In the past two sessions 1 voted against two
sweepstakes buis, and against the bill sponsored by my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), ahl of which
measures contained the same principle as we
have before us now.
The Senate expressed itself hast year ià
favour of sweepstakes, and has done 80 agair
in the present session by an increased
majorîty, on the motion for the second reading of this Bill. 1 was not present during
the debate following -that motion. There is

233

now an amendment to mnake the measure
applicable not only to hospitals, but also to
educational and charitable institutions. The
principle of sweepstakes having been adopted
by this House, I have no hesitation in suppor>ing the proposed amendment, because the
Legisiýature of my province has unanimously
passed a resolution asking Parliament to enact
legisiation Vo that effect.
I intended Vo move an amendment so that
the life of the Act might be limited to a
certain number of years, for I take it that
this measure is regarded by many of its supporters as an emergency measure which is
justified only 'by the abnoirmal conditions now
existing in our country. But the promoter of
the Bill moved that amendment himself.
Under the circumstances I feel that I shouhd
concur in the action of the Legisiature of my
province and support the proposed amendment. In this instance I arn simply expressing my personai view.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, this amendment was voted down yesterday-not by an overwhelming vote, but at
least it was defeated. It seems to me 'that
so far as the amendiment is concerned the
sponsors of this gambling proposai are at
least "coming clean." I think it is fair to say
that tbey always contexnpdated 'the operation
of sweepstakes for the purpose of securing
money that is needed because people are not
willing to dig down into their own pockets
for it. The proposai originated in British
Columbia. The people there were saîd to
be unable to maintain their hospitals, and
we were presented with reams of evidence
about charity and the appalling financial
condition in that province. Now it is said
that in the province of Quebec and elsewhere
several educational institutions would like to
launch out into greater activities. Hence this
gambling measure-for that is ahi it is. Lest
some honourable gentleman should eall my
attentdon to the point, let me say that I amn
not opposing the amendment on ultra-moral
grounds. I repeat once more that I have
played poker and bet on horse-races.
Sonti Hon. SENATORS: Shamel
Hon. Mr. MURDOC K: No, 1I arn not
particularly ashamed of myseif. Il eouhd afford
to do it. But in a period of twenty-five
years I have observed what seems to me the
greatest curse of labouring men-their propensity to ganible. I have known of women
and children denied the things they were
entitled to, because of the bread-winners'
craze for gamabling. I regard myself as being
to a certain extent my brother's keeper,

SENATE

234

though I am pretty certain that honourable
senators do not desire me to set myself up
in that capacity, and I do not complain of
their attitude.
What is the Senate of Canada undertaking
to do? To create gambling facilities for the
purpose of furnisbing the waherewithal to give
the sick desirable and necessary hospital
trcatment, and to educate our people. This
amendment is pretty broad in its scope. It
emanates frou the great province of Quebec,
but I am sure financially embarrassed educational institutions in the other provinces
would be glad to be able to say: "All right,
let us get our rake-off out of this pot." The
Senate of Canada will take a very unwise
step if it passes the amendment. Certainly
I shall vote against it first, last and all the
time. I think the people of Canada expect
better

guidance

from

this

Chamber

than

wouild be given tlem by the passage of this
measure. It simply tends to encourage the
helief that they (can lift thtenselves up by
their boot-straps.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
senators, I gave briefly my reasons for opposing the second reading of the Bill. Those
reasons need not be rehearsed nor even
summarized. One sentence expresses them:
I do net favour placing the imprimatur of
legislation on the practice of gambling in any
form. I took care to emphasize that there
was no way of eliminating the ultimate chance
from any phase of life, but pointed out that
because such elimination was beyond our
power we were not jistified in encouraging
the belief that ganbling, unadorned and unadulterated, was one of the methods of making
a living; indeed, our legislation should be
directed rather te the end of implanting in
the minds of our fellow-citizens that there is
one way, and one way only, of reaching
worth-wbile results in life, namely, the way
of intelligent toil.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
while holding much thxe same view as to the
Bill itself, now feels that because of the
principle having been adopted, despite bis
resistance, he is justified in supporting the
amendment and falling into line with the
opinion expressed by the Legislature of bis
province that facilities should be provided
by means of lotteries for the upkeep not
only of hospitals, but of educational and
charitable institutions as well. I cannot
follow him in what I am afraid I must describe as a tortuous course. We do not make
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

the purpose of the Bill sound if we extend
the objects to be served by a means to which
we should not give legislative sanction. We
cannot improve legislation which is inherently
against public interest by increasing the reasons for enacting the legislation. By extending the objects to be served we give new
impetus to the practice which the Bill permits. For this reason I feel bound in consistency, and I am certainly bound by my
instincts, to oppose the amendment just as
vigorously as I opposed the Bill itself.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I do not purpose to give a dissertation on
morals, but I wish to place myself on record
with respect to the amendment, because if
it should carry it would change my attitude
towards the Bill. I am quite ceady to admit
that I have twice voted for the Bill, but I
have donc so on the ground that its purpose
was only to benefit hospitals. Wbile I have
every sympathy with those who would like
to see it broadened, I personally should not.
This amendmxenit opens out the field of sweepstakes te an extent to which I do net agree.
Therefore I am going to oppose the amendment, and if it is carried I shall vote against
the Bill. My reason for speaking is that I
want to make my position clear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My attention bas
been cal.led to the fact that the amendnent
now before us is not exactly the saie as
the amendment we voted on yesterday.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. Yesterday it
was proposed to insert in section 2 the words
"educational or charitable institutions." Now,
I understand, it is proposed to inosert the
words " educational and charitable institutiens." There is a difference in the two proposals. As the latter part of section 2 now
stands, it reads:
-sweepstakes

for the puirpose of raising

noney

for the benett of one or more hospital or
hxospitals.

If the words "educational and charitable
institutions" are inserted, any moneys derived
from sweepstakes rust be devoted to hospitals, educational institutions and charitable
institutions. Under the proposal of yesterday
they might be devoted to hospitals, educational institutions or charitable institutions.
Personally, I prefer the amendment of yesterday.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I was not here
yesterday, but it was rny intention to make
my amendment the same as the one of yesterday; and I would ask the leave of the House
to have it corrected.

APRIL 12, 1934

members, I know of no special reason why this

hand, there is no reason why it should not sit

business to warrant our meeting. If there
is no such business, I move that we adjourn
during pleasure, in order that the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce may
take Up the Precious Metals Marking Bill,
which it is important to have the Committee

Precious Metals Marking Act, 1928, and

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved the third reading

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should
explain to honourable members that the purpose of the Bill is to amend various sections

of an Act passed in 1928, which itself was
merely a codification and extension of the
law that had been in effect for many years
governing the marking of precious metals and
articles of jewelry. The amendments, in line
with the spirit of the existing legislation, are
designed to proteet the public from being
deceived, misled or imposed upon by improper
markings on precious metals and articles made
therefrom, in respect of the importation, the
manufacture, and especially the sale of those
commodities. And by giving legislative status
to new national marks, significant of Canadian manufacture, for certain classes of
articles in the gold and silver categories, the
Bill should encourage the manufacture and
sale of such articles within Canada.

listening to representations for some weeks
and thern is no possibility of completing our
consideration of the measure until next week.
I think that disposition of the matter would
not bc hastened at all by our sitting tomorrow.
I therefore move that when the House
adjourns this afternoon it stand adjourned
until Tuesday neft at 3 o'clock. A meeting
of the Banking and Commerce Committee bas
been called for Tuesday, after the adjournment of the House on that day.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course it will
be some time before the public becomes
familiar with these markings.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
With permission of honourable members I should like
to give notice of a motion which I intend
to make when we resume on Tuesday next.
The exact terms of the motion will be filed
witli the Clerk of the House, and I now wish
merely to make an explanation which will
appear in Hansard.
Honourable members will recall that by
virtue of a diiscussion introduced by the bonourable senator from Russell (Hon. Mr.
Murphy) the subject of the division of labour
and responsibility between the two Houses of
Parliament was under review in this Chamber.
Various suggestions and arguments were presented during the debate. There was considerable agreement of opinion, not expressed
in any formal motion or resolution, but merely
reflected in the speeches of honourable members, as to what might be donc towards enlarging the usefulness of the Senate. One
suggestion stressed in the debate, and with
respect to which I observed no dissentient
opinion, was to the effect that a rule should
be adopted in both Houses with a view to
diverting to the Senate the initial consideration of all private bills.
The hope vas expressed that the Government would see its way clear to meet the
wishes of this House with respect to that
proposed reform, and I am glad to be able
to advise honourable members that this hope
has been realized. The effect of the amendment of which I am now giving notice will
be to preserve virtually as at present, but
facilitate to some slight extent, the procedure
for the introduction of private measures in
this Chamber, so that all such measures may
obtain their first and main consideration here.
There will be no reduction in the expenses
connected with the initiation of bills in the
Senate, but in the other Chamber a complementary motion is to be made, the effect of
which will be to increase very materially the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But the markings will be some safeguard, and they will
provide a standard in case of false description
or misrepresentation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

LEAGUE OF NATIONS
MOTION AND DISCUSSION

Hon. A. D. McRAE m-oved the following
resolution:
That this Hanse is of opinion that Canada
should withdraw from membership in the
League of Nations, and that noa further money
-should be voted ta the League.
Hie said: Honourable senators, in discussing
the motion befora the flouse, may I say I arn
-confident we ail desire the sama objective,
that is, world peace. I arn sure the Canadian
people as a whola are anxious ta do what .they
can, consistent with the weIlbeing and the

237

continued existence of aur Dominion, ta help
bring about the greatest of ahl warldly aima,
the abahishmant of war.
The League of Nations, ragarding which
there is a difference of opinion among the
Canadian people, is a proper subject for discussion, mare particularly at this time, whan
war is in the offing, and aur rasponsibilities
as a membar of the League in the naxt war
may develop inta something more seriaus
than we Canadians are willing ta assume.
The public discussions of the activities of
the League have presented only ane sida of
the picture. Those who regard the League as
no longer serving a useful purpose have been
very hesitan-t in expressing their views, as
wcll they mighit be, for I find amang my
extra-layai friends a feeling that it is a sort
of disloyalty on my part ta introduce this
motion, and again, others think that this is
not an opportune tima ta bring up -the
subi ect.
1 am hopeful that in any event the debate
on my motion will resuit in placing bafore
Parliament; and tha country sufficient facts
ta enable them ta decide the part, if any,
Canada shauld continue'ta play in the League
of Nations.
May I remind honourable members of the
new status which we enjoy as an independent
nation. As a sovareign state Canada is a
membar of the League the same as any other
country. We assume aur responsibilities direct
as the Dominion of Canada and not through
aur association with Grea~t Britain or the
Empire. As ta aur position in the event of
war, may I quate the opinion of Lard Davies,
who, I am given ta understand, was one of
the active foundars of the League. Writing
in 1931 as to the position of the Dominions
in case of war, he bas this, in part, ta say:
As mnembers of the League, they are, of
course, free ta choose for themselves....
Whatever attitude they may choose ta ýadopt,
has, in the present circumstances, little hearing
tipon the choica of Great Britain. . . . The
distance which separatas them from the Mother
Country precludes them from rendaring assistance in the avent of a sudden attack, however
willing they may ha ta aid in her dafence.
Before they arrived on the scene haîf the
population of Britain might have perished of
famine, gas and' disease. This result would
have been produced by the employment of
modern weapons. The times have changed and
adaption is the secret af existence. The ties
of nationality, race and sentiment are preciaus
heritages, but in the present necessity they are
powarless ta mould the destiny of nations or
individuals. Thus the self-governing Dominions
will decide the issue for theniselves.
Lord Davies' opinion recognizes aur new national statua ta whiých I have referred. This

SENATE
being a cicar statement of our position as a
member of the League, who will say that we
should nlot now discuss otir responsibilities?
May 1 say in answer to those ultra-loyalists
who are annoyed by this motion, that discussions as te Great Brjtajni's withdrawing from
the League are flot tabooed in England, and
that a section of the British press is very
active in that regard. There are those in
Engiand who advoeate that Britain should nlot
only withdraw fromn the League, but keep out
of the ncxt Europoan war and leave it to the
Continental nations to fight it eut arnong
themselvcs.
What would those Canadians who think we
should net debate the League do about our
participation in the next war? Leave it te
Downing Street to decidc for us? That policy
was exploded on this Continent over a century ago.
Britain's foreign policy does not offer much
Since tbe formation of the
encouragprment.
League cf Nations fiftecn years ago, bier policy
as a wbole bas been very indefinite. At the
moment, if we may credit tbe press reports,
Britain is negotiating, net througbi the League,
but direct with France, on tbe old prc-war
basis of coalition. There are several other
outstanding instances cf Britain's failure te
make use of the League. Before the War
Europe was a continent cf coalitions: se it is
to-day.
If Great Britain, by secret treaty or otherwise, should guarantce security te France, or
make a coalition with any otber continental
country or group, and a war should corne
about in wliich Britain must participate, have
we ne voice as te wbat Canada sbould do
about it? Many cf onr citizens think we
must figbt if Britain is at war. If tbat is se,
sbould we net bave something te say, at the
tirne tbey are being- negotiated, about the
treaties, coalitions, or agreements which
obligate us te flgbt? Yet where is tbe Canadian to-day who would advocate that Canada
should sign any treaty or john any coalition
whicb promises to involve us in a European
war? I do net believe that the Canadian
people will give any Governont a blank
cheque for war. For my part I new bold the
opinion, witb which I arn sure tbat at least
one member cf tbis lIeuse will agree, that
before Canada enters into any war, other
than for borne defence, the approval of the
Canadian people must be obtained. The
right honourable tbe leader cf this House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), je bis well-knewa.
ilamilton speech, first gave utterance te this
principle. He was eight years ahead of the
country. I did net agree witb him at that
oc those who have
f
time, but now I ar ne
lion. Mr. MeRAE.

caught up with him. Ls there any honourable
senator who, speaking on this motion, will
say Canada sbould be committed te a fereign
war without tbe voire cf the people being
heard? I do net think tbat any one cf us
will say that Canada sbould go tc war if the
majority cf our citizens say ne.
I know the objection bias been raised te a
referendum on war that it would take tee
long te ascertain tlic will of the people and
tliat much valuable tirne weuld bc lest. I
bcld that in these days cf rapid communication, and with the aid cf the provinces,
a referendum could be submitted and a decision arrived at witbin three weeks. During
this time initial wvar preparatiens could be
put under way if the Goveroiment se desired.
In any event wo are 3,500 miles aw'ay from
the Eurcpean theatre cf war, and, as Lord
Davies points eut, the loss cf tbree weeks'
time wculd make little difference. This is
particîîlarly truc ncw, als i t is generallv reeognized that the first great effort in the next
w-ar, witli the use cf the acroplane, will be
confined te gas bombs, germa bombs and
similar devilisb and destructive instruments
and inv entions cf war designcd to exterminato
first the civil population. Tbese efforts will
have spent tbemselves io the first week cf
the w-ar, and our participation two or tbree
months inter, at the earliest, would quite
likely assume the form cf the still more
gruesorne task cf restoration.
If the referendum, as suggestcd, is te be
oui national policy wvîth respect te war, wliat
could be mcre disîcyal te Great Britain than
cur failure te make that fact clear te hier at
this time? Why should we net make it
clear before, sle bias given ber assurances,
made bier treaties and assumed bier obligations? We must not wait until war is upon
ber, andtiten run eut. Let those who deprecate this discussion cn the League cf Nations keep this fact in mind. I do not believe
in the policy of wait and see wbat wil
happen. ýIt lias been truly said that "the
pcliey cf drift may place Canada at the
mercy cf accidents beyond lier control.' For
these reasons I advocate that Canada should
withdraw frcm the League new, when we can
do so with bonour.
As te the fairness cf a referendum, may
I assure those wlio fear the w'ar sentiment
might not be fully recorded, tha.t a referendum taken under the excitement cf war, with
the waving cf tbe flag, the cry cf loyalty and
the desire cf youtb for adventure, would at
least muster for tbe war party ail the strength
they can ever hope for.
Honourable senators, I trust I have sbown
ample grounds te ju.stify me in bringing in

APRIL 17, 1934
this motion at the present time, and the need
for the discussion which I anticipate will
ensue.
Fifteen ycars ago the League of Nations
was launched on the world with the active
membership support of more than fifty
nations, and the prayers of the war-weary
people throughout the universe. The possibilities of the League were immense. There
was to *be no more war. The League was
regarded as the grcatest effor.t for peace that
the world had ever known. Had it accomplished its objective the millennium wou'd
now be with us.
Mfter ail these years let us sec where the
League stands to-day. Two great nations,
Germany and Japan, have withdrawn. Russia
was neyer a member. More than a dozen
countries are not paying their ducs, and this,
I submit, should be equivalent to withdrawal. It is said that as late as September
of last year only fifty'-five per cent of the dues
were being paid and that the arrears werc
then £8911Î27, or over four and a half million
dollars. The report of the League for 1932
shows arrears at the end of 1932 of 24,000,000
Swiss gold francs, a sumn equal to $4,800,000,
These arc ahl round figures.
or £950,000.
Referring to the subject of dues, the Rigbt
Hon, W. Ormsby ore, as quoted in International Affairs, London, had this to say.
Quite spart from the questionable morality
of not paying your club subscription, the
failure to pay and the consequent uncertainty
and precarions character of the League revenue
have resulted in a very bad systemn of League
As experience shows that seme
budgeting.
countries do net pay, it is necessary, in order
te makze the Leagne incomne and expenditure

to the League, and is definitely unfair to France
and ourselves, who do pa up promptly.

psy promptly ail that is asked from us by
the League.
In connection with League dues I might say
that the annual expenditure of the League as
budgeted for 1932 was 33,000,000 Swiss francs,
or nearly $7,000,000. Our annual contribution,
beginning with $64,000 for the first year, bas
increased to $278,000 for the year 1932-33.
Our total contribution in the fifteen years
we have maintained our membership in the
League is somewhat over two and a haif
million dollars.

239

It is interesting to note that our dues as
a me.mber of the League are exactly onethird of the ducs paid by Great Britain;
forty-fivc per cent of dues paid by eithcr
Germany or France, each pay'ing the same
arnount, and fifty-eight per cent of the dues
of Italy or Japan, who are assessed equally.
So it would appear that for a nation of only
ten million people we -are paying our fui]
share. I might mention that the withdrawal
of Germany and Japan, who have heretofore,
by way of ducs, been contributing thirteeTi
and one-half per cent of the League's expenditure, is going to resuit in a ccrresponding increase in the dues which Canada will be
calcd upon to pay as a continuing member
of the League. An attempt to reconcile our
annual cash payments with our percentag1ý
allotment and the budge.t for the year lends
support to the Right Hon. Ormsby Gore's
criticism.
The League up to the end of 1932 has spent
more than $50,000,000, and at the present
time is spending, according to the budget,
33,000,000 Swiss francs, or slightly in cxcess of
six and a haif million dollars a year. There is
little evidence of any reduction of expenditure
in kecping with the urgent need for economy
throughout, the nations that compose its
mcmbership. In any event, the evcr-growing
annual expenditure in connection with our
membership in the League, aggregating now
nearly $300,000 a year, is an item which cannot be overlooked in these times of financial
stringency.
There are on the pay-roll of the League
1,150 persons, in ail departmcnts. The general staff numbers about seven hundred-698,
according to the 1933 report. A London dispatch refers to thcmn as 698 who are unknown
to the outer world, employed year in and
ycar out, drawing a total salary of £534,000,
or two and three-quarter million dollars. If
this figure is correct, at $5.15 to the pound
it would work out roughly at $3,900 for ecd
member of the genral staff, ineluding office
staff. This is certainly a very large average
salary. I find that by pro-rating that suma
over the total number of 1,150 cmployees, it
works out at roughly $2,400 a head, and this
too, I submit, is a high average, particularly
in Europe. Besides, the League is providing
a pension fund for its employees. The salary
list is headed hy Mr. Avenol, the General
Secretary, who is rcported as getting an
annual saiary of 90,000 Swiss gold francs, with
an entertaining allowance of 40,000 Swiss
francs additional, a total in dollars of approximately $26,000 a year.

Appeals to
Europe fall on deaf ears if they ask that international idealisma be considered before national and racial aspirations. So far the
League bas not sueceeded in getting a single
nation to allow international peace to take
precedence over national interests. Human
nature remains the sarne.
We must take the world as we find it, not
as we should like it to be. Ideals in international relations -cannot take the place of
certain and practical results. To-day Europe
is full of racial hatreds, grievances, ambitions,
suspicions and fears. Let me quote what one
of our well-known British statesnien has to
say about the League in this regard. I quote
Mr. Amery:
The realities of the world have flot changed;
they have not been cbanged by the Covenant
of the League of Nations, and they will continue
long after the Covenant bas disappeared....

deal of conscious or unconscious hypocrisy when
we talk about the League of Nations, about
disarmament, and about peace.
Then, the Rigbt Hon. Lord Dickinson in
The Conteinporary Review, London, states:
It is this that lies at the root of tbe trouble.
The world is losing the spirit of internationalism, and, unless this can be revived, it
is of littie use to talk about "reforming the
League."' . .. Men still talk of the brotherhood
of man and the federation of tbe world; but
we are in reality farther away from that ideal
than w-e were twenty years ago.
We bave
assunied too rasbly that when once a League of
Nations w-as set up human nature would change
of its own accord.
It is reported that even Mr. MacDonald
made no secret of bis aversion to the League.
Tbis it is said is borne out by bis repeated
and strenuous effort to revive the pre-war
Council of Great Powers. According to the
press bis recent negotiations with France may
result in a treaty guaranteeing security to
France.
International conferences bave replaced and
tbereby discredited tbe League. With the
single exception of Locarno, every international political con£ference is said to have

approaching this side of the picture, firet
permit me to quote a very frank statement
of a well-known British statesman, Sir Nairne
Stewart Sandeman. Hansard reports him as
saying:

will settle the question in Manchuria and
settle it very quickly, and the less time that

We frequently have assurance of peace from
quarters apparently close to the war racketeers of Europe. I refer to the armament
manufacturers, who are the power behinI
the arming and counter-arming of nations and
who are said to dominate the governments
of their own country. We are told that the
sale of armaments through Vickers-Armstrong
to foreign nations amounted to as much as
$100,000,000 last year. This would constitute
a large part of the increase in British exports
of steel in 1933. The revival of the steel
industry was the source of much gratification
in England. What a travesty on peace! While
the British steel and iron foundries are working overtime supplying the nations of Europe
and Asia with war materials, Mr. MacDonald
and Mr. Baldwin are working equally long
hours trying to bring about peace in Europe.
The Armament Trust of France, which is
said to control 182 French companies manufacturing heavy ordnance, machine guns,
tanks, shells, munitions and warfare chemicals, is said to have produced $300,000,000
worth of war materials last year. This Trust
controls the armament
manufacture
in
Czechoslovakia, whose exports of war material
were estimated last year at $30,000,000, which
constituted ten per cent of the country's total
exports.
While the statesmen of various countries in
Europe are holding conferences looking to
disarmament, factories in the same countries
are working overtime providing armaments
for the next war. With such glaring inconsistencies questioning international honesty,
is it any wonder that Europe is seething with
suspicion and distrust and that no nation
believes the professions of its neighbour?
Under these conditions it can well be said
that "war is a racket."
France stands for her right to security.
Germany wants a revision, with a return to
her of the Corridor and other territories taken
from her. Poland and the Balkans want to
maintain the status quo. Austria wants union
with Germany. Italy wants additional territory, particularly an adjoining section of
France. These territorial issues are insoluble,
because the racial spirits of the people are
uncompromising. Britain is as helpless to
remedy this situation as she was in 1914.
So that we may all appreciate our responsibility as a member of the League of Nations,
permit me to read Article 10 of the Covenant.
The members of the League undertake to
respect and preserve as against external
aggression, the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of
the League. In case of any such aggression,
or in case of any threat or danger of such

aggression, the Council shall advise upon the
means by which this obligation shall be
fulfilled.
Article 10 is a definite pledge which binds
Canada as a member of the League. Mark
the phrase, "this obligation"-for so it is.
Undoubtedly the practical enforcement of the
article when the time comes will mean armed
intervention.
There are those who think that the League
in order to enforce its decisions should have
a standing army, a sort of super-force drawn
from the member-nations of the League. A
military-equipped League of Nations is as
unthinkable as it is unworkable. It would
lack a common language and a satisfactory
single command. Wars would be certain and
frequent. In every war the soldiers composing
the international force, from several nations,
would be called upon, some of them to fight
their brothers or cousins. There would be
no unity. Disloyalty and espionage in the
League force would be sure to arise. Such
a force certainly can not be advocated by
those who want peace. It would mean just
Then without an army to
the opposite.
enforce the League's command what happens?
Witness Japan.
,Not only bas the League of Nations failed
to attain its original objective, world peace;
it bas even failed to restrain the coming
eruption. The League bas failed to condemn
the high-handed action and appears to give
the most careful consideration to the interests
of its powerful members. In short, it takes
no serious objection to the decisions of those
who defy it.
And what is more, the League bas failed
to be helpful in the economic crisis which bas
engulfed the world for the last five years.
It is as little effective in world prosperity as
it is in world peace.
The League bas been torpedoed by its
leading members, who now resort to secret
negotiations with other countries, also members of the League, and in some instances,
no doubt forced by the need for self-preservation, they are returning to the old pre-war
plan of coalitions. These members, the most
powerful in the League, appear to use it only
for lip service to peace.
Sensible men want facts, not fiction. Boys
in Europe are being trained for war; the
nations are in the spirit for war. Nationalism
is growing, the air of Europe is thick with the
talk of war. All old-world countries are engaged in mechanical war experiments. We
hear of new explosives, new gases, new guns,
new tanks, new battleships, new submarines,
new aeroplanes and many other contrivances,

APRIL 17, 1934
new and still more destructive-all surpassing
what has gone before, and designed to bring
death to the nation against which they are
first used.
Honourable senators who remember the ten
years preceding the outbreak of war in 1914
will recall the then current conviction that
war was inescapable. Many of us did not
believe it at that time. To-day the ambitions
and policies which made the World War certain exist unmodified. They are equally
irreconcilable, and war is certain to result.
The horrors of the last war have not been
forgotten. That the next war will be infinitely
worse is generally appreciated. People, as
always, have learned nothing and forgotten
nothing, and in the circumstances there will
be war in Europe. The situation presents
this remarkable paradox, that while the
nations all agree that another war will mean
the end of European civilization, the same
nations are to-day preoccupied in preparing
for that war! Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler
says. " The safest nations in the world are
the unarmed nations, the Switzerlands, the
Denmarks, the Norways and the Swedens."
Let us add Canada to this list.
I have a very definite opinion that the
people of Canada do not clearly understand
the responsibilities we have under Article 10
of the Covenant of the League of Nations.
Unless we are to regard our membership in the
League as a scrap of paper, our responsibilities
may mean another foreign war for Canada.
Not for the veterans of the last war-who,
with rare exceptions, are no longer fit for
active service-but for those who have come
of age since the last war; for the young men
in their 'teens who are not yet of fighting
age, and perhaps for some of our sons still in
their cradles.
The bonusing of large families by Germany
and Italy, both countries already over-populated, can only be to provide the human element still necessary to guide the modern
instruments of war. It is bad enough to send
our boys to kill in defence of their country. It
is unthinkable that Canadian sons should be
sent to Europe to war with these nationmade sons of a decaying civilization.
I wish I could arouse in the heart of every
Canadian mother with a son who is of military
age, or will become available for service in
the next ten years, a realization of the obligation which, with our high ideals, we are liable
to incur if we continue as a member of the
League to sit at the European council table,
surrounded as it is with distrust, disloyalty,
racial hatreds and ambitions, all of which lead
to war.
74728-161

My remarks might well be criticized were
I not to suggest to this honourable House
some avenue through which I think the objective of the League of Nations might be
attained. After fifteen years of futile effort
for international peace there remains but one
way ito obtain the abolishment of war. The
road is open, clear and certain, and tests the
sincerity of the nations that say they want
world peace. I refer to the total discontinuance by all nations of the manufacture and
sale of armaments and munitions of war.
Such a policy fully enforced would end war
at no distant date. Armaments soon become
obsolete, and if they are not replaced disarmament comes about by force of circumstances
in the course of time; for armies no longer
efficiently equipped would soon disintegrate
and without outside pressure reduce themselves to the strength of a national police
force. This more than anything else would
tend to restore confidence throughout the
world. There would then be reason to expect
that the present racial fears and suspicions
would gradually give way to that neighbourly
confidence and friendship which the world
so sadly needs to-day.

I have read the piffle about nickel being
essential to the manufacture of war equipment. There are substitutes for nickel, and in
any event there are dozens of commodities
equally indispensable to armament manufacturers. Why pick out the one thing whose
production Canada controls? After all, nickel
is entering more and more into the manufacture of domestic articles-a fact which should
be very gratifying to Canadians.
Why not recognize and deal with the real
trouble? If the nations believe in peace, let
them outlaw the armament racketeers as they
suppress other enemies of society. There are
not many armament manufacturers in the
world to be put out of business. The sincerity
of the nations' profession of peace depends
on this being done. Without such action we
may as well sit down and accept the world's
return to the pre-war policy of coalitions,
which may maintain peace for a while, but
in the end, as has always been the case, will
bring about war.
Last month as I stood in my room and
watched the veterans, in Ottawa for their
annual convention, marching up to lay a
wreath at the foot of the Peace Tower, I was
struck by the prematurely aged appearance
of the men who, less than a generation ago,
were the equal of the best soldiers in the
War. This was the result of war service.
So often we hear expressions of disappointment that to-day there are not more men

244

SENATE

qualified for public service in Canada.
I
would remind honourable members that
500,000 of the pick of our young manhood of
less than twenty years ago went overseas.
These were about all our physically fit young
men of that generation. Many did not come
back. Others were wounded and incapacitated, and virtually every ex-service man,
owing to long absence from home and to
life in the trenches, returned minus those
years of experience in private life which
educate and develop men along the lines that
lead to successful, peaceful vocations. That is
why to-day Canada seems so short of men
between the ages of 35 and 55 years. It is
one of the great, immeasurable national
losses due to war which are seldom, if ever,
referred to.
As I thought of the urgent need of assistance for so many of those veterans of the
last war, I wondered what was to become of
the living victims of the next war. There is
no language that can describe the horrors of
war. The few real battles I saw in the last
war left me always with the same impressionthat the world had gone mad. No words can
describe a modern battle. That is perhaps
why it is so seldom discussed. It is agreed
that the next war will be infinitely more
horrible. I am appalled at the very thought
of it. Call me an international pacifist if you
will, for I would have Canadian boys fight
no more in foreign wars.

In the "Intimate Papers of Colonel House,"
in his correspondence with Sir Edward Grey,
I find a letter of the 26th of August, 1915, in
which Sir Edward suggests that future generations should be protected against such a
catastrophe. That letter is followed by an
exchange of cablegrams between Sir Edward
Grey and Colonel House, and by a letter from
Colonel House to President Woodrow Wilson.
I have taken from them the following extracts:
London, August 26, 1915.
Dear Colonel House:

through mediation, I believe it must be through
that of the United States. All our efforts are
of course concentrated on saving ourselves and
our Allies by securing victory in the war. But

and in material interests, you have a great

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
MeRae) has given us his reasons in support
of his motion. It is quite apparent that he
supported the theory of the basic principle
of the League, but he has lost faith in its
application. Let us withdraw, he concludes,
and let us resolve to disinterest ourselves in
the fate of Europe, so as not to be drawn
into the vortex of the next confliet.
I readily admit that the League bas not
yet reached its objective, but I refuse to
accept the conclusions of my honourable
friend.
What was the object the creators of the
League had, in view? What was the origin
of the League? It is generally affirmed and
believed that President Woodrow Wilson
brought the idea to Europe. In reality the
suggestion came from Sir Edward Grev. We
all know the persistent and heroic efforts of
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs to prevent
the calamity which befell the world in August,
1914, and how he failed, through the duplicity
of the Wilhelmstrasse.

New York, October 17, 1915.
Dear Sir Edward:
. . . It bas occurred to me that the time may

On November 9, in a cable to the Colonel,
Sir Edward Grey asked whether that proposal
was to be taken in conjunction with his proposal for a League of Nations after the war,
as made in his letter of Septernber 22. To
this Colonel House, with Wilson's approval,
answered in the affirmative.
Then Colonel House wrote, in part, to the
President:

Truly Mr. Woodrow Wilson made himself
the champion of the idea, and when he declared war upon Germany he declared that
the United States was waging war to abolish

Nations for the maintenance of peace was
universally acclaimed. It was the fruition of
the first attempt in history at universal collective action towards peace.

re-armament. It could only be restrained by
the collective will of the Allies.

"But," says the skeptic, "the ideal is unattainable. The proof lies in the failure to
maintain peace in A.sia and to bring about a

rcduction of armaments." It is indeed surprising to see the rapid discouragement of
people when confronted wîth so formidable
a problem. It is not to be expected that the
habits of the world can be changed in a day.
I absolutely refuse to write the word "f ailure"
because of difficulties and reverses encountered.
Could it not as weIl be said that Christ's

from generation to generation.

The League

of Nations is stili in the experimental and
formative stage, and my experience leads me
to say that it is full of promise. In their
short lives men are kept at school from ten to
fifteen years. Governments and nations as
well must go 'to school, to a 'reformatory
where traditions will be transformed, and
instincts and passions curbed. The process
may be slow indeed, but the world is growing smaller, and more and more it will hear
and heed the voice of Geneva. Ail the
peoples of the world want peace. Through
the League of Nations tbey will more easily
find the evil-minded.
The League aimed at universality, but was
handicapped at the outset by the unpardonable egotism of the United States and the
lack of co-operation of the great powers.
Under the disin.terested guidance of the
United States that co-operation would have
been assured. What was the problem? It
was the execution of the Versailles Treaty,

seriously, or was it simply a stop-gap agreement or a truce? Whose duty was it to see
to its application if it was flot that of the
Allies who signed it? Germany was defeated

and disarmed. What was the danger to
guard against? Evidently it was Germany's
Count Apponyi, the great Hungarian orator
and pre-war pacifist, said more than once in
my presence, in 1900 and later, that every war
in the world's history was but one bloody
chapter which called fatally for another.
Who but Cermany can long to write the next
bloody chapter?
The Allies had won the war. Their elementary duty was to win peace. They could
do it only by co-operation. The representatives of the United States went back home,
and Lloyd George, who unfortunately was at
the helm in Great Britain, decided to revert
to the traditional policy of England and
appose the strongest. power in Europe. He
had the mistaken notion that France was the
dominating power, but Germany on the
morrow of defeat was, in passe, and still is,
the strongest power on that continent. Great
Britain and France clash nowhere. They have
both attained and exceeded their objective,
and they need nothîng more. If there are
two nations interested in maintaining the
status quo, it is they; whereas Germany wants
to recover its possessions and lost prestige.
Now Germany is on its feet, defiant and
.threatening. Is the League of Nations at
fault? It bas no armny to impose its will; it
bas but a moral force.
In the Manchurian confliet the League did
not falter. It laid down the law, but the
great powers alone could apply sanctions. In
the face of the complex nature of the problem
tbey did not choose to act or to impose
economic sanctions. Who will sit in judgment on their abstention? I will not attempt
to do so.
Some writers have suggested that for the
maintenance of peace the world should be
divided into three parts: the Orient, Europe
and America, each baving its League of Nations. The world is growing too small for alI
the nations not to be interdependent. A
maharajah of India told me that the news
from abroad and from ail over India was
circulating daily throughout bis principallty,
and that by means of radio modern ideas
were penetrating everywhere.
Now, as to the apparent failure of the
League to bring about a reduction in arma-

246

SENATE

ments, Jet us examine the problem at hand.
Article 8 contains the mandate to the League,
which reads as follows:
The mienbers of the League recognize that
the miaintenance of Peace requires the reductin of national armarnents to the lowest point
-consistent with national safety, and the enforcemient by conimon action of international obligatiosol.

The Conneil, taking acconnt of tihe geographical situation and circumstances of each
Statc, shall formulate plans for such reduction
for the consideration and action of tIse several
Governnments.
It is evident thaýt each nation, unless it
je assured of secnrity by common action, is
the sole judge of its nccds as regards its
national safety. At the meeting of the
League in September last it was quite apparent that Germany's position was untenable,
becanse its policies were repngnant to ahl the
nations; and when it realized that Great
Britain, the United States, France and Italy
were in agreetnent ini regard to imposing control of armamonts as a condition of disarmament, it hastened ta withdraýw. Thýere is no
need to look for any other cause.
Germany is bent upon re-arming, perhaps
not primarily ta wage war, but in order to

Germany. How can she pre tend she is arming for defence? In Streseman's Meoirs 's
ta, be found a statement ta the Crawn Prince
that the aim of Cermany in entering the
League 'vas ta obtain the Anschluss, the
Corridor and Upper Siiesia. Hitler's Bible,
"Mcmn Kanpf," states that there is but one
obstacle ta Germany's hegemony-the French
army.
Hence the impasse in which tbe Conference found itseif. Undaubtedly the situation
is a perilous ane. It contains a menace whichi
cannot be wvarded off unless the advice of Sir
Edward Grey and Woadrow Wilson is beeded
and collective action accepted.
The British leaders have not lest faith.
My bonourable friend (Hon. Mr. Mcflae) bas
said that same seemed ta express hostility
towards the League. It was net apparent in
the large meetings for peace heid quite
recently in London. The British leaders have
net lest faith. They stand by the League.
It is the only link hetween the nations whicb
desire peace. Tbe fate of Europe is ta-day
in tbe lap of Great Britain and the United
States.

and political -complications from which the
world sutl'ers at present, the United States

This reminds me of the indignation of
Senator Borah, who xvas incensed at the
statement af Mr. Stanley Baltdwin that the
root of the European difficulties wvas the
abstention of the United States. If he would

draws, there can bo ne League of Nations

Yet, incredibie as it seemed at the time, hanourable gentlemen, it came te pass. It is quite
true that we have net the sa-me League as

APRIL 17, 1934
devised in Paris; but, in spite of the betrayal
of the legitimate ambition of mankind by
the United States, my experience at the
League, and a closer study of the Covenant,
have radically altered my view and made me
a firm supporter of the League as it is.
What are our legal obligations under the
Covenant? They are to be found in articles
10 and 16. Article 10 reads as follows:
The members of the League undertake to
respect and preserve, as against external
aggression, the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the
League. In case of any such aggression or in
case of any threat or danger of such aggression, the Council shall advise upon the means
by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.
The withdrawal of the Unîted States left
Canada uncovered, and our governmentsand I use the plural-looking at the stringent
terms of this obligation, moved for an interpretation by the Assembly, which would take
due account of the geographical situation and
the special conditions of each state. This interpretative resolution reads as follows:
The Assembly, desirous of defining the scope
of the obligations contained in article 10 of
the Covenant so far as regards the points
raised by the Canadian delegation, adopts the
following resolution:
It is in conformity with the spirit of article
10 that, in the event of the Council considering
it to be its duty to recommend the application
of military measures in consequence of an
aggression or danger or threat of aggression,
the Council shall be bound to take account
more particularly of the geographical situation
and of the special conditions of each state.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And that, as far
as Canada is concerned, was interpreted as
the destruction of article 10. It was supposed
to have wiped out the application of article
10 to Canada. That was the construction
put upon it in the other House at the time.
But the resoHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
lution was a general one. It was moved by
Canada.
So far as our
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
obligations are concerned, we have repudiated
article 10. We are not bound by it. Is not
that the fact?
I have not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
finished reading the resolution. That resolution had the unanimous consent of the
Assembly with the exception of one vote;
so the President said that the resolution,
although not adopted, would be transferred
to the Council of the League, which might
take due notice of it. The resolution continues:
It is for the constitutional authorities of
each member to decide, in reference te the
obligation of preserving the independence and

247

the integrity of the territory of members, in
what degree the member is bound to assure the
execution of this obligation by employment of
its military forces.
The recommendation made by the Council
shall be regarded as being of the highest
importance and shall be taken into consideration by all the members of the League with
the desire to execute their engagements in good
faith.
This resolution, as I have just stated, did not
meet with unanimous endorsation, because
of the dissidence of one member-Persia.
The Assembly has more than once recognized that the geographical position of a
country had to be taken into consideration.
The Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of
1923 left each continent to defend itself
against an aggressôr from within, and article
Il of the Protocol of 1924 stated that when
sanctions were called for, each of the signatory states would co-operate loyally in support of the Covenant and in resistance of any
act of aggression to the degree which its
geographical position and its particular situation as regards armaments allowed. Likewise, article 8 states that the Council, taking
account of the geographical situation and the
circumstances of each state, shall formulate
plans for the reduction of armaments.
If we examine article 16, which speaks of
our obligations, it will be seen that the sanctions mentioned against an aggressor are twofold-economic and military. They read as
follows:
Should any member of the League resort to
war in disregard of its covenants under articles
12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to
have committed an act of war against all other
members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance
of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals
and the nationals of the covenant-breaking
state, and the prevention of all financial,
commercial or personal intercourse between the
nationals of the covenant-breaking state and
the nationals of any other state, whether a
member of the League or not.
This covers the military sanctions:
It shall be the duty of the Council in such
case to recommend to the several governments
concerned what effective military, naval or air
force the members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used
to protect the covenants of the League.

The economic sanctions would, I am quite
sure, be the sole contribution that Canada
would be called upon to make in the case of
European war. Our country, to my mind,
would not hesitate to sever all trade and
financial relations with an aggressor if it were
requested so to do by the Council of the
League. We surely could net do less in duty
to ourselves and to humanity. We would

248

SENATE

not do less under the Briand-Kellogg pact.
Mr. Stimson, ex-Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
intimated that the United States would be
forced to apply such sanctions against a
violator of the pact. It is my profound conviction that if the President and the Senate
of the United States officially said as much,
it would be a potent factor for the maintenance of peace in the world.
With respect to military sanctions, our
Parliament is supreme, under our interpretation of article 10. That is an opinion shared
in by my honourable friend from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach). The Council of the
League must be unanimous in its decisions as
to such sanctions. In a European conflagration the Council would surely not call upon
the two Americas for military contribution.
The United States expressed the fear that they
would be

called

upon

to intervene

if they

entered the League. If they did join the
League there would be no conflagration in
Europe. The Council contains three South
American coutries which would not lightly
assume military obligations in Europe. Like
Canada, they would be agreeable to the imposition of economic sanctions.
Since the foundation of the League Canada
bas been in less danger of being drawn unwittingly into war for purely sentimental
reasons, because Great Britain lias accepted
the obligations of the Covenant, and because
we are now in a position to inform ourselves
on any complication that may arise, and in
due time to exert our influence towards a
peaceable solution. In 1899 public opinion in
England was sharply divided on the causes
which led to the South African War. It is my
opinion that had there then been a League of
Nations, we should have been saved such a
humiliating conflict.
Verily something bas changed in the world.
Aggressive wars will become more and more
difficult because of the search-light at Geneva.
The fear of public opinion will curb the evildoer. We al] know the efforts Germany made
in 1914 to froe itself from the odium of
denunciation as the aggressor, and how in an
attempt to save its face it manoeuvered in the
last days of July to saddle the guilt on Russia.
Governments will henceforth have great
difficulty in hiding their secret ambitions and
their insincerity. A grand jury formed of
fifty or more nations which all ardently want
peace will not be slow to detect the false note
in the special pleadings of one which has
something to hide. No nation wants to appear
at the bar under the slightest suspicion of
evil intentions.
When the age-old policy of conquest was
vetoed by Woodrow Wilson and an effort was
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

made to provide for control over certain territories through the creation of mandates, little
did the beneficiaries realize that they would
be held to account by the League of Nations.
Its Mandate Commission bas exercised an
admirable
supervision.
When complaints
reach it, the mandataries are eager to justify
themselves in open session at Geneva.
Who would hear of the complaints and
grievances of minorities if there were no
League of Nations?
More than 25,000,000
people are under the protection of the League.
Who outside of the League of Nations would
have concerned themselves about bundreds of
thousands of refugees? It is most interesting
to watch the exertions of all the nations to
show the strictest regard for moral laws and
the highest ethics obtaining in a civilized
world. They are all on their good behaviour
in the presence of their peers. More and more
the secondary and smaller nations will become
conscious of their role and dare to speak their
mind. There are certain questions upon which
they hesitate to express themselves, fearing to
displease the great powers. But that is not so
with Canada.
When your representative
raised the question of the treatment of minorities' grievances, Mr. Motta, the then President of Switzerland, told *me that no European nation would have dared raise such a
debate, because its good faith would have
been suspected and questioned.
This brings me to the rôle which Canada
bas played and may continue to play at
Geneva. Canada is not entangled in any
embarrassing situations. It bas no possession
nor protectorate to guard, near by nor afar,
nor any ambition nor aspiration to achieve.
In other words, the imperialistic microbe bas
not affected our body politic. Canada has
the proper perspective and a clear vision.
Canadians enjoy absolute freedom and do not
understand why it should be denied to other
nations. They hate war and want all international differences to be solved by the peaceful means of arbitration.
All the nations which have not might to
defend their just cause prefer a tribunal or an
arbitral court to the battle-field.
This
appeared clearly in the course of a debate
at the Assembly of 1924. I recall it with a
double object: to show the intense feeling
of all the nations gathered at Geneva in
favour of peace, and to show what a factor
Canada can be in furthering that cause. In
September of that year the Prime Ministers
of Great Britain and France, MacDonald and
Herriot, agreed upon submitting to the
Assembly the principles of compulsory arbitration, security and disarmament.
These
three points formed the basis of Covenant

APRIL 17, 1934
amendmnents called the Protocol, which aimed
at closing certain gaps in the Covenant and
making more certain the prevention of war.
That basis, which the Assembly had been
seeking for four years, was acclaimed with
enthusiasm by aIl the delegations.
A month later the MacDonald Government
was overthrown in England, and succeeded
by the Baldwin-Chamberlain Administration.
That Government rejected the Protocol, as
we did. But it went further and rejected as
well the principle of compulsory arbitration,
to the utter dismay of the Assembly, and also
refuseýd to accept the compulsory jurisdiction
of the Permanent Court of International
Justice. Canada's stand was different. By a
dispatch of the 9tb of March, 1925, the Prime
Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, declared this
country would not adhere to the Protocol because of "the effect of the non-participation
of the United States on the enforcement of
the sanctions, in the case of a contiguous
country like Canada," but that Canada would
be prepared to consider acceptance of the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent
Court in justiciable disputes, and to consider
methods of supplementing the provisions of
the Covenant for settiement of non-justiciable
disputes.
During the four years which followed, 1925
to 1929, the Assembly made yearly attempts
to further the cause of compulsory arbitration,
but could make no headway because of the
constant obstruction by Sir Austen Chambe-rlain. Canada could not change its stand to
suit the polîcy of the new Government in
England and the varying moods of the British
electorate. On the contrary, this country
more than once reaffirmed its position. In
1927 the Netherlands Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Mr. Beelaerts von Blokland, moved
that the Assembly, without attempting to
resurrect the Protocol, examine anew the
principles underlying that instrument. Sir
Austen vigorously opposed that motion because it involved compulsory arbitration. The
Canadian delegate reaffirmed our position,
and it was recognîzed on ail hands that
Canada was elected to the Council on account
of its policy on the question of arbitration.
In June and July of that year there was a
Conference on Naval Disarmament in Geneva,
at which Canada was represented by Mr.
Lapointe. That conference failed because the
naval experts of the United States and Great
Britaîn had disagreed. Lord Robert Cecil,
who represented the British Government, was
dissatisfied with the instructions hie had received from London and hie retired from the
Government. H1e coined at that time this
neat phrase: "The naval experts should be

249

on tap, not on top." It was at that conference that an American delegate was accused
of holding a brief for and receiving a fee fromn
some steel or shipbuilding firm. Lord Ro~bert
Cecil înformed me that Canada could give
a very effective lead to the people of Great
Britain if we acted upon our expressed intention of accepting the optional clause. H1e was
most happy to learn that we were moving ini
that direction.
At the Imperial Conference of 1926 in
London the Dominions had been led to consent not to adhere to the optional clause until
they again conferred over it. This was a
shrewd move of Sir Austen Chamberlains.
Sir Cecil Hurst, the then legal expert of the
Foreign Office, who is now one of the judges
of the International Court, expressed surprise
when I informed him in -the autumn of 1928
that we werc about to accept the optional
clause, for hie thought we were bound to await
another conference. I told hiým in a bantering
tone that hie had drafted the 1926 resolution
badly, and that we were conferring through
the circularizing of the sister-nations, without
waiting for an Imperial Conference. And ini
February, 1929, our Prime Minister, Mr. King,
an înformed the Commons. The negative attitude of the Baldwin-Chamberlain Government
at Geneva was violently assailed during the
May elections in Great Britain, and after its
defeat Lord Robert Cecil puhliely expressed
gratefulness to Canada for taking the initiative
and dispelling the impression that the
Dominions were opposed to compulsory
arbitration.
When Mr. Ramsay MacDonald announced
to the Assembly of September, 1M2, that
Great Britain was adherîng to the optional
clause, the Canadian representative stated tha-t
Canada had neyer faltered in leading the
Commonwealth towards its position. Canada
announced its decision to sîgn the compulsory
ýarbitration clause on the 6th of September of
that year, and next day the Winnipeg Free
Press, in applauding this action, stated that
in 1927 Sir Austen Chamberlain had explained
at Geneva bis refusaI to sign on the ground
that such obligations could more easily be
accepted by a homogeneous state than by a
great community of free and equal nations.
Mr. Dafoe, the writer of that article, said it
was somewhat remarkable that these difficulties had so suddenly disappearedl And hie
added:
This attitude was rooted in a distrust of the
World Court as a foreign body that might
interfere with British policy and interests.
It was fitting that, with the removal of the
obstacles through the defeat of the Baldwin
Government, Canada should be the first of the

250

SENATE

British nations to announce to the Assembly
its intention of signing the optional clause.
Cana-da had been desirous of signing the clause
since 1925, as the record shows.
When Ramsay MacDonald announced to
the House of Commons his adhesion to the
optional clause on compulsory arbitration, Sir
Herbert Samuel, speaking for the Liberal
party, commended his action in contrast with
that of the preceding administration, and
cited an article on this subject by Madariaga,
the brilliant Spaniard who was then professor
at Oxford and is now Spanish Ambassador
at Paris, from which I will read a brief
extract:
The period of stagnation in the League was
due to England's policy of inaction.
The
impetus given to the League by the MacDonald
Ministry accounts for the activity we are
witnessing to-day.
This spectacle should make the English
understand what an enormous responsibility
rests upon them in international affairs. If
they halt, the League of Nations halts; if they
advance, the League of Nations advances.
Not only did Great Britain and Canada
adhere to the principle of compulsory arbitration in justiciable matters before the Hague
Tribunal, but at the Imperial Conference of
1930 they decided to sign also the multilateral
treaty, called the General Act, by which they
agree to submit all cases of non-justiciable
nature to an arbitral tribunal. The ratification
of that treaty was moved in this Chamber by
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) in 1931, and was unanimously
passed.
All these forward steps leading to peace were
the work of the League of Nations. Since our
relations with Great Britain are so intimate,
we are perforce highly interested in Great
Britain's foreign policy, which directly or indirectly may seriously affect us. As we have
seen, that policy bas varied in the past from
one government to another. And it is apt to
vary likewise in the future. Canada may
have some difficulty in following these variations.
Its only safe course will be to
encourage the peaceable solution of all international differences, as it is solemnly bound
by treaty to do.
When Mr. Kellogg asked the world to renounce war as an instrument of national
policy, Canada unhesitatingly gave its signature without cavil or reservation. But Sir
Austen Chamberlain made a reservation that
Great Britain should have freedom of action
in certain regions, comparable to the noninterference upon which the United States
insist with respect to South America. This
surprising reservation in a document designed
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national
policy was generally
commented upon at Geneva, and many diplomats claimed to find therein the reason for
Sir Austen's refusal to accept the principle of
compulsory arbitration. And the Senate of
the United States, when it ratified that treaty,
declared the Monroe Doctrine was in no wise
affected by it. This goes to show that it is
hard for great powers to discard their instrument of domination-force-and to accept a
common measure of justice, equally distributed
among the mighty and the weak.
There will have to be a long process of
self-denial, of resignation and of assimilation.
Canada, free and untrammelled, will more
and more, and fearlessly, raise its voice to
hasten this evolution. The "Reformatory
School" bas just been opened, yet some people
want to close it because no tangible progress
is apparent. They evidently do not know
what spirit animates the class, and have not
followed the progress which bas been made.
The world is so much in need of peace that
pessimism offends its natural aspirations. The
League of Nations exists. All our best efforts
must be to guard it and to strengthen it.
To abolish it would be to abandon humanity
to fatalism and despair. The existence and the
history of the world are not reckoned by decades. When asked my opinion as to the
future of the League, I would suggest that
the answer be postponed until the League
reaches two score and tan. But it may be
possible to make a satisfactory reply much
earlier. We need not be impatient. We are
building for geneiations to come. I am
satisfied to lat them judge.
The honourable gentleman from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) would like to economize
on the annual sums which we contribute to the
League. Yet we spent last year less than
$300,000 in furtherance of world peace. Our
yearly budget for national defence totals
$13,000,000, exclusive of any capital expenditurc. What part of that sum would be needed
to ensure our domestic peace? Surely less
than half that amount. Of what real use can
the other half be. which we spend to guard
against outside danger? For our protection
against foreign assault I would rather rely
on the co-operation of the international
gathering at Geneva, at a cost to Canada of
$300,000, than upon the millions which we
spend annually for the protection of our
frontiers. And I humbly suggest that my
honourable friend the mover of this resolution
could easily find means of saving $300,00[ in
the restriction of our military, naval and air
force budget. I am quite willing that we

APRIL 17, 1934
should pay the premiums for two policies of
insur'ance. Only the future can prove which
will be the more effective of the twe.
Hon. E. MICHENER: Honeurable members, the heneurable leader on the other sîde
of the Huse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), as a
fermer Presîdent of the Assembly of the
League of Nations, speaks with authority on
the subject-matter of this débate. By bis
appeintment the Assembly did bonour net
only te our distinguisbed celleague, but as well
te the Dominion wbicb lie se ably represented.
In my opinion hie bas very effectively answered
the arguments udvanced by my honourable
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae),
but as I occupy the office of President of tbe
League of N&tions Society of the city of
Calgary, I desire to 'make a few supplementary
observations.
My main criticism. of the bonourable gentleman frem Vancouver is that lie made an excellent speech on the wreng side of the question.
0f course the League of Nations is net above
criticism, but I submit at this stage of its
existence any criticism. sbeuld be censtructive
rather than destructive. He based bis main
argument for our witbdrawal from the League
on article 10 of the Covenant, whicb in lis
view migbt involve Canada in war. In my
opinion ,that centingcncy is very, very remete.
If any member-nation or a nation outside the
League sbeuld resert te war, its members are
pledged te witbdraw their nationals from, and
te terminate alI financial and commercial
intercourse wîtb, the offending country. In
other words, the League members would eutlaw any nation wbich refused te submit the
dispute te the court of the League.* It can
hardly be conceived that any nation would
place itself in that unenviable position.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What about
Japan?
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: Japan is an exception, but there wereHon. Mr. LYNCJI-STATJNTON: Japan was
net a member of the League.
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: She was at that
tiýme; sbe is net now. The two great powers
mest vitally interested in Japan's eperations
in China were Russia and the United States,
and the fact that they were net members
made it &till more difficult for the League te
exercise its authority.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Ahl the great
powers had signed the Kellogg pact.
Hon. Mr. MIÎCHFNER: Yes; and if tbose
signatory powers weuld regard the pact as
sacred, there would be ne more war. But let

251

me say this to, my bonourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. M.r. Griesbach). The case
of Japan and China is -the only one with respect to whicb -the League failed to bring
about a settiement. As I have said, there
were difficiilties and complications which apparently the League could flot overcome, and
the sanctions under article 16 were flot enforced. Rewever, because it failed in one
case out of fifty, should we decry the
League or throw up our hands in despair and
cease to give it our support? If upon the flrst
reverse of the Allied cause in the Great War
we ýhad taken the samne stand and had withdrawn our forces, what would the rest of the
world have thought of Canada? Likewise,
what would the fifty-five nations now members of the League say if Canada, upon the
first failure of the iLeague's effort at peace,
should decide te withdraw hier support?
I agree witb my bonourable friend's contention that Canada sbould net engage in war,
especially in Europe, witbout first submitting
the question to the electers. War is such
a serious undertaking that I think the people
of a democratic country should be consulted
before this extreme step is taken.
The honourable gentleman from Vancouver
criticizes the League on economic groundson the cost of its operations. These cannot
be estimated in dollars andl cents. The
League is the only effective organization teday te premeote the settlement of international
disputes by peaceful metbods. If it bas laid
the foundation for ultimate success-and I
submit it has-then it has accomplished something wbicb bumanity has boped and longed
for through the centuries.
Let us, however, look at the question from
the monetary standpoint. The honourable
member says that the annual cost of our
membership in the League is $278,000.18,
whicb, after alI, is only a small fraction of
our interest payments on indebtedness incurred through the last war. The Finance
Department charges te war and demobilization $1,695,912,8W0, and war pensions te
date aggregate 3592,619,334-a total cf
$2,288,532,194. The interest on this huge sum
is over $100,000,000. The annual burden may
become very much beavier if the League of
Nations is net successful in preventing anotber war. This beavy interest payment is
400 times more than our yearly contribution
towards the League's efforts te promote peace
in the world. Tbe man Who pays $1,000
income tax pays just one-tenth of a cent as
bis contribution te the League of Nations.
Se, after aIl, in relation te the cost of
war the cost of organization for peace is
infinitesimal.

252

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does the
honourable gentleman mean to say that if our
total annual contribution to the League were
assessed against the income taxpayers of
Canada, they would each have to pay onetenth of one per cent?
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: No. I say if a
man pays $1,000 income tax he pays only onetenth of a cent as his contribution to the
League.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
That is
to say, if they were the only taxpayers?
Hon. Mr. MICHENER:
Of course it
amounts to a little more per capita. The cost
is infinitesimal as compared with the interest
on our expenditures in respect to the late
war.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I agree
with that.
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: The total yearly
budget of the League of Nations is £1,233,112.
This, divided among fifty-seven nations, is
only about one-half the cost of one battleship.
The late Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig,
shortly before his death, stated: "We have
one more victory to win-the victory of
peace." The "victory of peace" cannot be won
for the world by criticism, indifference or inactivity. It must be fought for, struggled
for. The length of time within which the
victory can be accomplished will depend upon
the efforts put forth by the various nations
of the world through the League or some other
effective agency.
To-day the only organization through
which the different nations can co-operate is
the League of Nations. Until a more effective
organization can be created, it is the one
hope of the world for a better understanding
among nations, so that international disputes
may be settled by Courts of International
Justice instead of by brute force. We must
have either international law, justice, and
government as initiated by the League, or
international chaos, race of armaments, and
Armageddon.
I repeat, the critics of the League cannot
justify their opposition on financial grounds,
as the yearly cost of its peace efforts is
only a small percentage of the yearly cost of
preparation for war.
Let me review briefly what the League of
Nations has accomplished in the fourteen years
of its existence. We must bear in mind that
for centuries the world had decided its international disputes by force. Therefore, if in
the few short years of the League's existence
it has been able to effect even a partial
settlement of international disputes, I submit
Hon. Mr. MICHENER.

it has justified its incorporation and its efforts.
Since the League was organized fifty international disputes have been submitted .to it,
all of which but one have been settled
satisfactorily to both parties. In five cases at
least war had already begun, but it was
stopped by the League and a settlement
effected.
One of the examples of settlement is found
in the Anglo-Persian Oil dispute. On November 27, 1932, the Persian Government cancelled the concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil
Company, in which the British Government
was a large shareholder. Britain appealed to
the League under article 15. The parties
agreed to suspend further action pending
negotiation, and a new and satisfactory contract was arranged.
The principal criticism of the League, in my
opinion, comes from armament manufacturers.
There are those, on the one hand, who
think that the League devotes too much time
to secondary affairs rather than to the direct
promotion
of international
peace.
The
League, after the War, did a great and
effective work in the reconstruction of
Europe. It looked after the repatriation of
war prisoners, as well as refugees from different
European countries. It
also helped the
financial reconstruction. It loaned, upon international guarantee, $27,000,000 to Austria,
to re-establish ber finances.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Was the loan
not made on the guarantee of Great Britain
as a matter of fact?
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: All the members
of the League joined in the guarantee. Great
Britain received repayment of a debt of
£2,500,000, which probably Austria would net
have been able to meet but for the international guarantee of the $27,000,000 loan.
The League also made a loan to Hungary,
and provided financial assistance for other
international purposes.
The League organized a Permanent Court
of International Justice at The Hague. This
to my mind is one of the most important
movements in the history of the world. The
court is composed of fifteen judges of the
highest international repute. The first meeting was in 1922, and by December, 1933, the
court handed down twenty-one judgments,
twenty-five advisory opinions and nineteen
orders, which form a new body of international case law.
The League also organized the International Labour Bureau, taking the view that
peace could not be attained without social
justice. It co-ordinated labour conditions in
different countries and secured the adoption

APRIL 17, 1934
of labour standards to guard against abuses
in international competition. This in itself
is a very important work on the part of the
League. During these fourteen years, by
bringing about improved social conditions, it
bau done a great deal of humanitarian work
among the nations of the world.
Now let me refer to the effectiveness of
the League. In order to enforce its mandates
one sehool of thouglit believes that an international police force should be set up. This
would appear to be the logical means of enforcement. On the other hand, there are
those who believe that only moral and
educational suasion should be used. To establish an international force to back up the
decisions of the League involves the question
of national sovereignty. Many nations hesitate to face this issue. However, as a mesuit
of rapid transportation and improved communication, the womld lias in some respects
virtually become one family or nation. Therefore, international law and regulation must lie
established among the nations to govern their
actions one with another. This the League
is accomplishing by its Court of International
Justice and its interchange of opinion among
the different member-nations of the League.
Someone has said, "As nations we must now
ahl hang together or bang separately." To
"hang scparately" is another terra for cornmitting nati-onal suicide. If each membernation were to withdraw fromn the League, as
my bonourable friend recommends Canada
should, then surely there would lie chaos and
we should lie f ar more likely to have to
defend our country froma attack than if we
hang together as members of the Leýague.
No nation liveth unto itself any more
than any person liveth unto himself. We
must be controlled by established laws, as
well internationally as nationally, if we are
to have order and peace throughout the world.
There is no doulit, in my opinion, that the
League is the inspimed effort and organization
of the best thought througbout tbe worid.
Doubtless theme will lie reaction against proBut as
gmess towards world-government.
nations we must lie prepamed to give up Our
sovemeignty for the greater freedoma and peace
of the world.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1s my honourable friend advocating a super-state?
Hon. Mr. MIiCHENER: I sulimit that if
we agree to give militamy power to the League
of Nations, we must to that extent surrender
our national sovereignty in order to ensume
world peace. I have not the slightest doulit
that we must lie willing to lie governed by the
majority opinion of the nations as expressed

through the League. The League is only in
its infancy. For centuries there was no international law or justice, and war had been the
arbiter of disputes among nations. In the
light of its great achievements in these few
short years of humnan bistory, doubtless the
historian of the future will regard the estabilishment of the League as the most important step towarde human betterment and goodwill among nations.
.1 arn confident there will be progressive
efficiency ini the development of the League
as we realize its weaknesses. We must at ail
hazarda go forward, forThro' the ages one increasing purpose mons,
And the thouglits of men are widen'd with
the process of the suns.
And one thing is sure-the more people of
goodwill of ail nations get behind the League,
the sooner shall we realize the prophetic
vision of Tennyson:

INITIATION 0F PRIVATE BILLS
AMENDMENT

0F

rIULE

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN rose to
move:
That Rule 114 be amended by deleting therefrom the following words which appear in lines
3 and 4 thereo: 'eight clays before the meeting
of Parliament."
He said: ilonourable members, this is the
motion of which I gave notice last Thursday.
It is the culmination of efforts made by this
House over a period of several decades to
obtain from the other House such a degree of
complementary legisiation, or such an alteration of the mules, as would more evenly divide
the labour and esponsibilities of legisiation
'between the two Chambers.
This House bas suffered more than it bas
merited by meason of the fact that in the
Senate, mucli more than in the other
Chamber, the womk is done in committee.
The degmee of energy and efflciency which our
committees give to pondeming over and
threshing out not only the detail, but the
substance of legisiation, is wholly out of proportion to the attention whicha the public gives
this assembly. This is a condition which we
should not pamticulamly lament. I do not
know that it meally makes mucli diffemence.
The important thing to us ail is to secure
what we feel are woth-while resuIts, regardless of whethem our work attracts the attention of the public or not.

SENATE
However, we recognize that the work of the
two louses is different in character. The
practice has grown up-in fact it bas existed
from the very beginning-of initiating the
preponderance of legislation in the other
Chamber. In the speech that I made on this
subject when the inquiry of the honourable
senator from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy) was
under review, I expressed the opinion that
with only one member of the Government in
the Senate it would not be possible to increase to any great extent the proportion of
legislation now initiated here. A bill introduced into this Chamber must be guided
through committee.
Ifs long and ardous
journey necessitates on the part of the person
guiding it a thorough command not only of
the history of legislation on the subject
treated, but of the details of the particular
measure under consideration, and on the part
of each member of the committee ability to
understand the viewpoint of various intorests
affected and to weigh all the representations
advanced. While the burden of guiding
Government legislation continues to rest upon
the single member of the Government in this
Chamber, it is not possible to increase very
greatly, beyond what has been the practice
in these three sessions, the volume of Government measures introduced here.
In the debate to which I have referred the
Senate considered the wisdom of enabling
ministers from the other House to enter this
Chamber in order to conduct their legislation,
and of securing a similar and complementary
concession from the House of Commons.
This idea received considerable support from
both sides of the House. I ventured to express the view that no great danger was to
be apprehended from such procedure, and that
it had many advantages. The proposal did
not meet with universal favour in this
Chamber, however, and in any event it seemed
wise that we should proceed step by step,
moving where we felt surest of our position
and taking care that we made no mistake
in
effecting a reform along this line.
Consequently, what emerged with universal
support, namely, the proposal which looked
to the initiation in this Charnber of all the
private bills presented to the Parliament of
Canada, was seized upon as likely to afford
the groundwork for an advance.
Though the proportion of private legislation as compared with Government legislation is not increasing, being, I believe, about
the same now as it was twenty or thirty
years ago, yet there is a continuous expansion
in the volume of private bills, with the growth
of the country, and if this Chamber underlion. Mr. MICHENER.

takes to conduct the initiation of all private
measures it will take upon itself a measure
of work and responsibility which will very
considerably increase its activities.
With this object in view I held conferences
with other members of the Administration,
the result being that on the same day upon
which I gave notice here the Prime Minister
gave notice in the other Chamber of an
amendment of the rules of that House looking to the attainment of the end to which
common assent had been given.
I shall now read the rule to which the
present motion refers, and make clear its
application. The rule, which is No. 114, reads
as follows:
Any person seeking to obtain a private bill
shall deposit with the Clerk of the Senate,
eight days before the meeting of Parlianient,
if it 1s intendeld that the bill shall originate
in the Senate, a copy of such bill in the English
or French language, with a sum sufficient to
pay for the translation of the same by the
officers of the Senate, and the printing of six
hundred copies in English and two hundred in
French. The applicant shall also pay the Clerk
of the Senateand so forth. This is the rule which it is
proposed to amend by deleting the words
"eight days before the meeting of Parliament."
The omission of these words, as proposed
by the amendment, would appear to have the
effect of permitting the introduction of a
private bill into this House at any time.
Honourable members might appreiend that
inconvenience would result from the opening
wide of the door for the whole session; but
I draw attention to rule 110, which says:
No petition for any private bill is received
by the Senate after the first three weeks of
each session; nor may any private bill be
presentef to the Senate after the first four
weeks of each session; nor niay any report
of any Standing or Special Coimittee upon a
private bill be received after the first six
weeks of each session.
Clearly, under this rule, the Senate has
effective control over the time during which
private bills may be presented. Indeed honourable members may even consider the
control too rigid. I am advised, however-and
such has been my experience over a brief
period-that notwithstanding the rigid terms
of rule 110 we have virtually never, on a
proper case being made out, refused a private
bill the right of admittance to this House.
The Senate, on the recommendation of the
Committee on Standing Orders, grants an extension of time, particularly when long
adjournment inconveniences those intending
to bring in private bills. The Committee on

APRIL 17, 1934
Standing Orders has very seldom refused te
extend the time for the introduction of such
legislation into the Senate. All that I desire
te emphasize is the fact that under the proposed amendment the introduction of private
bills into this House is facilitated by the
sweeping away of the restriction which requires them te be introduced eight days
before the meeting of Parliament. Thus an
invitation is extended te those who desire
private legislation te submit their case te
this House; and only such control is reserved
as may be necessary te prevent the abuse of
the open door.
In order te see that the effect of this amendment shall be what is desired, namely the
transference of the initiation of private bills
te this Chamber, it is necessary te bear in
mind the action -that is being sought in the
other Chamber. The rule of the other Chamber which it is sought te alter is Standing
Order 93. It reads as follows:
Any person desiring to obtain any private
bill shall deposit with the *Clerk of the House
not later th-n the first day of each session, a
copy of such bill in the English or French
language. with a sum sufficient te pay for
translating and printing the same; the translation to be done by the officers of the bouse,
and the printing by the Department of Public
PrintingI ask honourable members te note that what
follows is te be struck out by an amendment
proposed.
-and if such bill is not deposited by the time
above specified, the applicant shall, in addition
te the charges for printing and translation, pay
the sum of -five dollars for each and every day
which intervenes between the first day of the
meeting of the House and the date of the
filing of the bill; but such additional charge
shall not exceed in the aggregate in any one
case the sum of one hundred dollars.
This latter portion, which will be stricken
out if the motion in the other House is
accepted, had the effect of enabling the introduction of legislation into that House upon
the payment of a penalty. Furthermore, the
tax of $200 which is imposed by the succeeding part of the same rule for the introduction
of a Bill in the other Chamber is te te increased te $500, while the tax in this Chamber
remains the same.
The main feature of the alteration now proposed te be made by concurrent action in the
other House is, of course, the increase in the
fee; and. I think honourable members will
concede that the increase is se substantial
that it will be te the interest of those who
have private legislation to advance te have
it introduced here. While this increase is
the main feature of this proposal, the other
features also are important, because in the

case of the Senate the door is more widely
opened, and in the ,case of the House of
Commons it is more narrowly closed.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: Is there
any definition of a private bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Every bill
is a private bill that is net a Government
bill and does net affect a public general Act.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is a bill
introduced by a member of this Chamber
always a private bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I do
not know that I should attempt the exacting
task of definition without more adequate
preparation. A bill which relates te the general
public interest or affects a general publie
Act is net a private bill even though it is
introduced by a private member; but a bill
relating te a private interest or affecting a
private Act is a private bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: A public bill in
the Senate becomes a private bill in the other
House, even if it affects the public interest.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Every bill
is of publie interest. I think the line I have
drawn is fairly clear and correct, though I do
net wish te say with finality that I am
absolutely right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do net think
anybody will object te the statement of my
right honourable friend as now qualified. A
private bill concerns private matters, and any
private member may further a public bill,
even if it affects a general Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do net suppose that any objection can be taken te the
motion of my right honourable friend, because
even if there were no action in the other
House we could dispense with the part of
rule 114 which it is proposed te delete. As
my right honourable friend bas stated, the
more important part of the change is the
increase in the fee by the House of Commons
I rose only te express surprise that this
motion te amend one of our rules should be
made without previous and special notice te
each of the members of the Senate. But I
am told that rule 29, to which I refer, applies
net in the case of an amendment, but in the
making of a new rule. Rule 29 says:
No motion for making a standing rule or
unless two days' notice
arder can be adopted, given thereof, and the
in writing has been
senators in attendance on the session have been
summoned to consider the saine.

SE NATE
I do flot remember wbether that clause
bas
been in our rules from their inception.
1
I
think it bas been. In 1906 or 1907, when we
revised the rules of the Senate, we retained
this one, and, in order to give more solemnity
to our rules, enacted that no change in any
rule or no new rule should bc brought in
without the senators being specially summoned to examine the motion. As a matter
of fact, when a rule was to be moved, we
were generally called to the Senate half an
hour before the officiai meeting time by
a
special notice, for the purpose of taking
cognizance of the motion and passing upon
it. I was wondering whether an amendment
to the rules would flot fall under rule 29,
because some amcndments may so vary a
rule as to constitute a new rule. 1 have an
open mimd on the question, and as the proposed amendment is flot of any great importance, I do flot press the point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
Notice, of
course, was given, and very amply given, on
Thursday last. Rule 29, to which the honourable senator refers, gocs on to say:
-and the senators in attendance on the session
have been summoned to consider the same.
I do flot know wbat that can mnean except
such procedure as bas been followed.
If a
notice is given of a motion to be put before
the flouse and considercd to-day, are
not
senators summoned to consider it? And
how
are you to summon them more solemnly than
by saying that on Tuesday, the l7th
of April,
this motion wilI be presented for consideration? The Senate is summoned to meet
on
this day. I do flot think the summoning
is
any more emphatic or carrnes any more
prestige because senators are summoned
bialf
an hour earlier than usual.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:
I am flot discussing the value of the rule; I only mention
it. This rule may not be applicable to
an
amendinent. Nevertheless I would draw
the
attention of my right honourable
friend to
the fact that rule 29 provides:
No motion for making a standing
order con bo adopted.* less two days'rtide or
notice
iii writing bas been given thereofMY right bonourable friend has complied
witb
that part of the rule.
-an(I
the senators in attendance on
session have been sunmmoned to consider the
the
same.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Are we
not
summoned?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But not specially.
Ever since I came to this flouse it bais
been
the practice to send to ail the senators

DANDURAND.

attendance a special printed notice of any
motion for a new rule, and a summons for a
certain day and bour. At first it was customary to meet for the consideration of such
motions haîf an hour before the usual time
of opening, but this was considered to he
inconvenient, and later we were specîally convened at tbree o'clock. I would point out to
my right honourable friend that the intention
of the Senate, as expressed by tbe rules, bas
been that tbey should flot be changed by a
new rule, or the repeal or amendment of an
existing one, unless honourable members were
specially notified of the motion for the proposed change.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN:
How were
they specially notified? Through the mail?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I tbink we have
always reccived -the nlotice through the mail.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: There are two
rules respecting notice of motion concerning
the Hules and Orders. Rule 23 says:
Two days' notice must be given of a motion
for any of the following purposes:
(a) To make a new rule or standing order.
or to repeal or amend an existing rule or
standing order.
This I tbink applies to the present motion,
which is to amcnd a rule. Then rude 29 reads:
No motion for making a standing
order eau ho adopted, unless two days'rule or
notice
in writing bas heen given tIesuuf, and the
senators in attendance on the session have been
sumnmoned to consider the same.
This rule, wbicb mneans that each senator in
attendance on the session must receive a
written notice of the motion for making a
new standing rule or order, does nt apply to
an amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: May I ask,
Mr. Speaker, where is the rule which says that
before the Senate is summoned to consider
any motion each senator must receive a
written notice? Is that in the rules?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is the practice
under rule 29.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Rule 29 does
not say there must be a written notice to
eacb senator. It simply says that two days'
notice of the motion must be given in wnîting,
and that the senators must be summoned to
consider it. Surely the Senate is summoned
to meet to-day to consider this motion.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTO,.N:
Is this
case not similar to that which arises when
a matter out of the ordinary comes up bef ore a company meeting? In sucb instances
a special notice is always given and the com-

APRIL 17, 1934
pany's shareholders are usually summoned to
meet haif an hour earlier than the regular
hour.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly
special notice is given in such a case, but it
is not more specific than the notice 1 gave
of this motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But our coming here to-day was to attend to the general
Orders of the Day.
-Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: We corne
witbout a summons when we meet ordinarily.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We cannot
have any stronger summons than we have for
our meeting on any day.
.Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does the
word "summoned" there mean the giving of
a notice?
Right Hon. Mr. ME'IGHEN: There has
been notice. The idea that each senator must
be notified in writing is certainly not borne
out by any rule which bas been drawn to
my attention. If it is something that is a
result of hoary tradition, it seems to me it
will soon be fit for burial.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTION: Must we
not give some special interpretation to the
words in the rule?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHLN: 1 should say
that the only special interpretation required
is what the words say: the senators in
attendance on the session must be summoned
to consider the motion.
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-iSTAUNTON: Why are
those words there?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think they are very useful, but I cannot see
anything in them requiring the Clerk to send
out a special letter to each senator. I hope
the practice of sending letters in such cases
bas not been followed to such an extent as
to make it a binding obligation for the future.
Hon. Mr. DýANDURAN'D:- It bas always
been the practice during my time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: 1 arn informed
that it has been the practice for the past
twenty-five years. Bourinot says:
That a motion for a new rule cannot be
adopted unless two daye' notice is given, and
the senators have been specially summoned to
consider the same.
The use of the word "specially" might justify
the practice of sending out written notices.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is an
*additional word which Bourinot put in without autbority.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND:
At ail events
His Honour the Speaker declares that this
amendment can be made without special convocation, under rule 23, and that rule 29
deals only with motions for new rules and
orders.
The motion for the amendment of rule 114
was agreed to.

like the Bill to be read the second time today, but I will not ask the House to go

Hon. Mr. DAND'URAND: Then perhaps
my right honourable friend would be agreeable to the second reading being moved

look over the Bill. We have heard of it

Transcontinental Railway of certain tracks
and premises of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company at Quebee.
Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable members,
when this Bill came before the Standing
Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, of which I am a member, I asked for
certain information from officials of the
Canadian National Railways. Since that
time I have been away, and I understand that
during my absence someone appeared before
the Committee and stated that the city of
Quebec, the Canadian National Railways, His
Majesty the King, and the Canadian Pacifie
Railway had no objection to the provisions of
this Bill. In the circumstances I wish to
make a few observations. In the first place,
I do not sec any necessity for this measure.
If the Canadian National Railways and the
Canadian Pacifie Railway were able to concude a certain agreement without any legislation by Parliament in 1914, there is no
reason why they cannot do the same thing
to-day. In 1930 certain changes were made m
that agreement, and still it was not thought
necessary to have a law passed on that
account.
I submit to this honourable House that
before we pass this Bill we should know more
than we know to-day about the things that
were done in 1914 and 1930. The first party
mentioned in the Bill is the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company, the second is His Majesty
the King, and the third is the Canadian
National Railways, or in other words the
Canadian people. For some time now steps
have been taken with a view to developing
co-operation between our two great railwayc,
and I think it would be a mistake to put on
the Statute Book of Canada a law confirming a contract affecting those railways for 99
years, when the people of Canada do not
know what the contract is about. The contract affects property rights, and I ask the
right honourable leader of the House if it
has ever been registered-if the agreement
bas ever been known in the communities concerned. In my opinion we should not pass
the Bill until we are given further information, and I therefore move, in amendment,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

that the Bill be not now read a third time,
but this day six months.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, one is never finished with surprises
in the long journey of life. I had no notion
that there was even any difference of opinion
over this measure, but, as there is, I think
that the discussion should be adjourned until
the Chairman of the Railway Committee is
I presume he will be here to-morpresent.
row, and I am sure he will be able to answer
the honourable gentlemans questions better
than I can.
I had thought that the brief explanation
I gave of the measure on second reading was
sufficient. Seemingly the only new point
raised by the honourable gentleman is that
there bas not been any registration of the
agreement which it is now proposed to ratify.
I think the people of Canada know, and
always have known, that any agreement with
His Majesty the King in relation to railways
is necessarily a part of the record of the
Department of Railways and Canals of Canada, and that a copy of it can be obtained
there. I do not know of any registration
that would be more available for search
than one such as that.
However, as I have already suggested, I
think that it would be better that I did not
attempt to answer the honourable gentleman's questions and that we postponed the
motion for third reading until the Chairman
of the Committee on Railways is present.
The right honourHon. Mr. PARENT:
able gentleman bas been a member of the
House of Commons, and ho knows that anyone who requested information concerning
the National Railways was always told that
it was impossible to get any.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That must
have been during the period of 1921 to 1926.
I cannot dispute the statement of the honourable gentleman in that respect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think that
from 1921 to 1926 there was a special committee of the House of Commons appointed to
look after matters concerning the Canadian
National Railways.

260

SENATE

Having read the Bill, I do net see any
objection to it at all. Its purpose is merely
to ratify a contract made some time ago;
and I presume this is essential because His
Majesty the King-that is, the Government
of Canada-was a party to the contract. The
Government can make no contract withoul
secu-ring the authorization of Parliament. The
effect of the Bill is to give this authorization.
I have no doubt that an answer to the
honourable senator from Kennebec could
better be given by the Chairman of the Railway Committee than by myself.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I gladly accept the
suggestion that I repent what I said, or meant
to say, yesterday. I take it that this Bill
speaks for itSelf. As a citizen of Quebec 1
am entitled to examine it, and after doing so
I wondler why it should have been brought
into the Senate at the present time. As the
right honourable gentleman has said, it is
clear that the purpose of this Bill is the
ratification of contracts between the Canadian
Pacifie Railway and the Canadian National
Railways, represented by His Majesty, which
contracts were entered into in 19'14, twenty
years ago, and modified by a few amendments
made in 1930, four years ago.
Anyone who knows local conditions in the
city of Quebec will realize that, owing to
industrial developmcent, they have changed
greatly since 1914. The centre of population
has moved, and if the opinion of the people
of the city could be secured to-day they
would very likely say that it is a mistake to
have the C.P.R. station right in the heart of
the city. By this Bill you give the effect of
law to agreements which may have been good
twenty years ago, but place the city of Quebec
in an unfair position to-day. Take for instance Dalhousie street, where the C.P.R. has
had tracks since 1914. The people of the city
desire to have those tracks removed, because
they interfere with traffic. Anyone who tries
te cross over to Levis by means of the Quebec
and Levis Ferry will find a great congestion
of traffic at St. Andrew and Dalhousie streets,
one car after another waiting, just because
the tracks of the C.P.R. are there. Years ago
this did net matter, but to-day it is different.
By this Bill, giving the effect of law to an
agreement between the Canadian National
and the Canadian Pacifie railways, you bind
the people of the city of Quebec to that agreement for ninety-nine years to come. The
reason for this I do not know. I have tried
to ascertain why this Bill is before us. Up
to the present no one has been able to show
justification for it. Surely it is net in the best
interest of that city.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. LUCIEN MORAUD: Honourable
senators, I think my honourable friend from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent) is right. The
contract may have been a desirable one when
it was made, but I suppose that at that time
the Government hoped the Canadian National
would build its own terminal facilities in Quebec within twenty years, which was to be the
life of the agreement unless there was ratification by Parliament. We are now being asked
to agree to ratification which would make the
agreement effective over a term of ninety-nine
years. This Bill may be in the interests of
the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian
National Railways, but would it be fair to
bind the people of Quebec to the contract for
such a very long time?
Up to 1930 the Canadian National was
forced to bring all its freight traffic to the
Canadian Pacifie terminal, but in 1930 the
contract was amended, and the Canadian
National now bas the right to handle freight
at its own sheds. Neverthcless it lias to pay
a proportion of the maintenance costs and
interest on the capital investment in connection with the Canadian Pacifie sheds.
I say again that I think my honourable
friend from Kennebec is right, and I repeat
the question: Is it fair to bind the people of
Quebec for ninety-nine years to a contract
to which the people themselves are net a
party?
Right Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: Honourable senators, as this is a Government measure and I was not present at its incubation,
I hesitate to say anything about it. But had
I been given the opportunity, perhaps I
should have taken the same ground that the
right honourable leader of the House takes
now.
Dissatisfaction with the railway arrangements in Quebec is net new. In my time
we had arranged to have a lino extended from
the Quebec Bridge along the river front to
deep water.
I am speaking entirely from
memory. That line was extended to make a
connection with the Champlain market. It
was thought by engineers and persons interested in the railway that it would be beneficial te Quebec and to shipping generally,
particularly to passenger traffic, to have docks
down along the river front at deep water, in
proximity to the bridge, for the greater convenience of handling traffic across the bridge,
in either direction. That plan was approved
by the city of Quebec, if I remember correctly, and in order that it might be carried
out the railway purchased some property.
Later a piece of railway, which I think belonged to the Canadian Northern, was

APRIL 18, 1934
acquired for the purpose of running a line
farther east, on the other side of the city,
and the plan for making a deep water port
on the river front a few miles east of the
bridge was abandoned. After that time it
was suggested, as honourable members may
remember, that a tunnel should be built
underneath the city to make a connection
with what I call the eastern terminus. However, the tunnel project was never gone on
with.
In the course of time the Grand Trunk
Railway, which is now part of the Canadian
National System, became a party fb the
operation of joint terminals in the new port.
I am not telling any tales out of school when
I say that ever since there has been dissatisfaction with the course that was taken, and
the people of the city of Quebec-in part at
least-have been unhappy because they did
not get the deep water terminal on the river
front as contemplated when the Quebec
Bridge was constructed.
At Quebec the two railways have made
arrangements for the joint use of terminals,
as has been done in many other places. In
nearly every one of these instances the Canadian Pacifie, .I understand, has taken the
initiative. The arrangements that have been
made at Quebec have been approved, though
I would not say by all the people. At any
rate, the two railways have made an agreement. It is now presented to Parliament for
ratification. Why is this done? I am not a
lawyer, but I think one reason is that since
the Canadian National is a Governmentowned road, parliamentary sanction is necessary for such an important agreement, lasting
more than twenty years, which is the
statutory limitation.
- I do no.t subscribe to the view that if we
ratify the contract no change in the location
of the railway tracks at Quebec can be made
until the expiration of ninety-nine years;
though it may be that the existence of the
contract would tend to make more difficult
any attempt to bring about a change. If
any railway or group of railways is doing
something contrary to the interest of a community, irrespective of whether there is a
joint agreement, the community can apply to
the Board of Railway Commissioners, and if
it is successful in proving its case a remedy
for the evil will be found. But there would
be no remedy in the refusal of Parliament to
ratify an agreement sent to us at the request
of both roads.
When this Bill came before the Railway
Committee it appeared that the honourable
gentlemen from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent)
and La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) felt, as they

261

have said to-day, that it was inadvisable to
ratify the agreement. At the suggestion of
these two members the Committee adjourned
further consideration of the Bill for, I think,
two weeks, to permit the corporation of the
city of Quebec to send a deputation or make
protestations in any other way it desired. But
no protestations were made. Consequently
the Committee passed the Bill. I am strongly
of the opinion that while the six months'
hoist might inconvenience the two railways
it would not in any way benefit the city of
Quebec. The city of Quebec will not be prejudiced in any way by the ratification of the
agreement. It will always be at liberty to
apply to the Board of Railway Commissioners
should it consider its rights to be adversely
affected.
In a measure I sympathize with the people
in their dissatisfaction with the pool train
service between Montreal and Quebec. Quebec feels that the operation of the pool trains
is unsatisfactory, and is inclined to retaliate.
But to refuse to ratify this agreement would
neither accomplish the purpose in view nor
help the city one iota.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would the position be
aggravated if the Bill were passed?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No. The Bill
simply ratifies an arrangement that has been
in force for twenty years.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable senators, I gather that this legislation has

been inspired by the Board of Trustees of the
Canadian National Railways. As I have said
before, in view of the very serious financial
condition confronting the country I must
stand by the decisions of that Board. I have
full confidence that before the ninety-nine,
year term has elapsed, Mr. Fullerton, Mr.
Labelle and Mr. Morrow will see that justice
is done to the old city of Quebec.
I was a member of the Government with
my right honourable friend from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham), who was then
Minister of Railways, when the question of
the Canadian National Railways terminus at
Quebec was discussed in Council, and I remember that he and the late Sir Wilfrid
Laurier did their utmost to protect the city's
rig:hts. The selection of the first site was made
by the late worthy mayor of Quebec and expremier of the province, the father of my
honourable friend from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Parent), the Hon. S. N. Parent. At the time
he was President of the Transcontinental Railway Commission. Everything went along
smoothly until 19111, when there was a change
of government at Ottawa. Then the site was

262

SENATE

changed at the request of the late Hon. Mr.
Pelletier, a very able representative of the
district and city of Quebec. It was agreed
that the terminus should be located at the
water's edge on Champlain market, the most
prominent and probably the most historic
place in the old city, for it is there that Champlain landed and built his famous abitation.
It is there also that the old church of Notre
Dame des Victoires was erected to commemorate a defeat of the British navy. That
site was selected only after keen controversy.
The city considered the land was worth much
more than the price offered by the Government. The late Sir George Garneau was then
mayor of Quebec, and I well remember how
frequently he came to Ottawa and urged the
Government to pay an adequate price for the
valuable property. Ultimately terms were
arranged and everyone expected that suitable
terminal facilities would be provided. But
war intervened and all public expenditures
were suspended.
I sincerely hope that the Board of Trustees
will within a relatively short time see its way
clear to rcndor justice to the old city of Quebec., which, with Toronto and Montreal, has
been a pioneer in railwav building. At a time
when it bad onIy a small population Quebec
heavily mortgaged its future to ensure the
construction of the North Shore Railwav.
It was not until many ycars later that the
city was reimbursed its expenditure on this
accou nt.
The Canadian National Railways terminus
is not located where it should be. It is true
that as in the city of Ottawa the two large
raihway systems are co-operating at the Central station, so in Quebec they have joint
facilities at the Palais station. But whenever
I travel on a Canadian National Railway
train and reach Quebec in the early morning
I feel that I am indeed a poor relative, because I never hear so much clanging of bells
and so many shrill whistles as when I am
being shaken about in my berth by frequent
sbunting before the train comes to a standstill.
By eontrast, the Canadian Pacifie train comes
in smoothly and its passengers look withshall I say?-some disdain on the poor Canadicn National travellers.
While, however, I have every sympathy
with the plight of the old city of Quebec, I
repeat, we must not interfere with the Board
of Trustees of the Canadian National Railways. We must never forget that we are
passing through a terrible crisis and must be
careful about the expenditure of public money.
I quite agree with what has been said by
the boonourable senator from Kennebec, the
son of my old friend the Hon. S. N. Parent,
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

who did so much for his city and his province.
I am also in sympathy with what my friend
from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) has stated,
and I hope that as soon as the revenues of
the Canadian National Railways justify the
expenditure the Board of Trustees will do the
right thing by the old city of Quebec.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, as one who for several years bas
had something to do with the railroad game,
I wish at the outset of my remarks to say
that I am opposed to railway amalgamation
as suggested in certain quarters.
Last session Parliament enacted legislation
providing for co-operation between the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railways in order to bring about coordination of services and consequent reduction of expenses. That legislation, however,
bas nothing to do with this measure except
from the standpoint of consistency.
What is involved in this Bill? In 1914
the 'Canadian Pacifie Railway had in the city
of Quebec a passenger station, with roundhouse, freight shed and other facilities necessary for handling its business at that important terminal.
The city was at that time
served also by the Quebec and Lake St. John
Railway, a small privately-owned line, and
the Canadian Northern Quebec Railway, running from Montreal through Shawinigan and
along the shore of the St. Lawrence to Quebec.
On the completion of the Quebec Bridge and
of the National Transcontinental Railwav east
from Montreal to Moncton at an expenditure
of millions of dollars, it appeared to be a
reasonably good business proposition to provide for the additional traffic to be developed
as a consequence of the entry of the National
Transcontinental into the city of Quebec.
Accordingly an arrangement was made as set
out in schedule A to the Bill. It is a businesslike arrangement, and if twenty years ago it
had not been entered into and the National
Transcontinental had built its own terminal
facilities, we should to-day be shedding tears
over the heavy expenditure thus involved.
Now, if we are to be consistent in our
effort to bring about proper co-operation
between the great privately-owned and the
great publicly-owned transcontinental systems,
why should we not now ratify and confirm
this twenty-year old plan for reasonably
cheapening the cost of operation on a joint
basis? Will anyone suffer by the continuance
of the agreement? Certainly, even as a representative of unemployed railway men I cannot demand for the Canadian National employees in the city of Quebec a share of the
work that the agreement may bo alleged to
take away from them. In my judgment, in

APRIL 18, 1934
the existing circumstances the agreement is
hogical and consistent and entirely in line witb
the raihway legislation enactcd last session,
and for the hife of me I cannot sce wby
there should be any objection ta the Bill.
My bonourable friend who last spoke (Hon.
Mr. Lernieux) intimated that we must not
interfere with the decisions of the Raihway
Board.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Board of
Trustees.
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK: I understood him
ta say the Raihway Board.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: No, the Trustee
Board.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As I understand,
the iRaihway Board, or, ta give it its fuhl title,
the Board of Raihway Commissioners for
Canada, would not have anything ta do with
the decisions of the executive officers of the
two railway systerns.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: The Ilailway Board
is a court; the Board of Trustees is an executive body.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This instance cf
co-operation bctwcen the two railways had
been in existence long bef are we passed the
railway legislation last session.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: The agreement ta be ratified by the Bilh was entered
into twenty years ago.
Hon. Mr. 'MURDO'CK: Yes. Under the
legisîstion enacted hast session the two railway
systems were directed ta co-ordinate their services as far as possible. This Bill sirnply
ratifies a consistent and logical agreement
along similar lines that bas been in effect
for the past twenty years.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGUEN: Honourable memibers, the motion in amcndrnent
by the honourable senator frorn Kenncbec
(Hon. .r. Parent) has at least had the result
cf canvincing me--I hope, intelligently'-that
the Bill is essential. Sa firnl.y arn I convinced cf this that I hope no shadow cf
doubt wilh be expresscd in the judgment cf
honourable members. I cannot conceive cf
the 6enate presenting a more pitiable spectacle than in seriausly hesitating over this
Raihway co-operation ta bring
measure.
about economy bas been insisted upan by the
peophe of Canada, and by Parliarnent, and
mast emphatica'lly by the Senate. When
plans te ensure that result were under way
we became impatient, we did net feel we
were reaching the goal fast en-ough, and we
wanted to instruct the Canadian Pacifie and
Canadian 'National executives ta proceed more

263

rapidly to brin-g about greater econarny of
operation. Indeed, at the instance of the
honourable senator from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) we passed a resolution reminding the two railway executives that it was
their business to art ahead of the statute
along lines of co-operation.
Now, what is this Bill? It is a Bill to
sanction an agreernent entered into betwecn
the railways, nineteen years ago, for the cooperative use of the terminal in the city
of Qucbec, in order to save money by avoiding
duplication. Early in 1930 this agreement,
rnodified to, some extent, was ratified by a
new agreement. And now, although we
lectured and rebuked the railways for extravagance and endeavoured to instruet thern
along the lines of co-operatien and economy,
on the first occasion when they bring before
us something that they have donc along these
lines , without our instruction, we are &sriously
asked to say thern nay.
Why are we asked to do this? I have been
reading the debate that took place in the
Ilouse of Commons, and I observe that the
whole argument binged on the fact that certain trains had been pooled. A pooling has
taken place between Ottawa and Toronto,
between Toronto and Montreal, and now, at
the very last, between Quebec and Montreal.
Already there has been a saving of $500,000
a year by it. Yet as soon as this last pooling
arrangement takes effe'ct we are told, "We
cannot put up with it, because it is possible
to travel ten or fifteen minutes faster the
old way."
Notwithstanding the fact that Parliament
would like to make new expenditures and
have fine buildings and the very fastest and
rnost luxuriaus railway services everywhere,
I seriously suggest that no honourable member should object to a measure of this kind,
whîch is in strict accord with the financial
policy that we put into effect. If we were
even to countenance such an amendment as
that proposed by the honourable gentleman,
an amendment which bas no basis at all in
economie public policy, it would be interpreted by the railways as a stultification of
the Senate.
This Bill is ncoessary solely because under
the statute the companies are incompetent
ta contract for a period of more than twenty
years. The two companies have ta corne ta
Parliament. Are tbey to be rebuked by us
for making economies such as we said they
were negligent in not making long ago?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I presume, honourable gentlemen, I have the hast word in regard ta this matter.

appreciate very much, and thank them for,
the nice things they have said about the city

to press the amendment any further.

Intoxicating Liquors Act:
Right Hon. Mîr. MEIGHEN: Stand. I
hardly think this Bill will be carried any
further.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the honourable gentleman given any explanation as to
why he is postponing this Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I shal
give it again. Certain objections to this
measure were raised by Alberta and, I think,
by Saskatchewan, on the ground that it would
interfere with their controi of liquor importation. I never could see any force to the
objections of these provinces, but it was
intimated to me long ago that the Bill would
not be proceeded with until everything was
made satisfactory to them. Since then I have
received intimation that it will not be gone
on with at all. As I have heard nothing of it
for a long time, I am inclined to think it is
not going to be dealt with further. I shall
probably be able to speak more definitely tomorrow.
The motion for the second rcading stands.

RELIEF BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 42, an Act respecting
Relief Measures.
Hon. M1r.PARENT.

He said: Honourable members, it may be
necessary for me to give some explanation of
this Bill when we go into committee, but
possibly I owe it to the House to give now
a brief résumé of its purposes.
We have had a Relief Act every year since,
I think, 1930-certainly since 1931.
The
previous bills have each been largely. but
not exactly, along the line of the present
measure.
In some of them provision was
made to enable the Government to extend
relief to corporations, in the interest of the
unemployed.
Soch a provision does not
appear in this Bill. Like the previous ones,
it provides for advances to provinces for relief purposes, and for certain construction
works undertaken largely with the object of
relieving distress. It also provides for financial
assistance to the Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, by way of loan, advance, or
goaranter, or otherwise, and enables the Department of the Interior and the Department
of National Defence to continue certain works
which they have been conducting in varinas
parts of Canada, and by means of which
single unemployed men bave been taken care
of.
The Interior Department, wbich is responsible for the administration of our national
parks, bas been doing forestry work, road
work, and work in the way of preparing landing stations and the like. I have no very
direct information as to the efficiency with
which this lias been done, but I have heard
no complaint on that score.
The Department of National Defence lias
been maintaining a large number of unemployed men in camps where work of n very
light character, in comparison with that done
by the Interior Department, is carried on.
The systein bas been to provide the men with
good food, clothing, a tobacco allowance and
twenty cents per day, dn exchange for a
reasonable amount of work. These men live
under discipline, and from the information
that bas come to me in my private capacity,
when travelling about the country, I feel
confident that these camps bave been admirably conducted and have been of great service
in alleviating unemployment.
There is also a clause which was in the
previous measures--I thought it had been
omitted last year, but I was mistakenclause 3, which enables the Governor in
Council, when Parliament is not in session,
to take such measures as in his discretion
may be deemed necessary or advisable to
maintain, within the competence of Parliament, peace, order and good, government
throughout Canada, and at all times to take

APRIL 18, 1934
all such measures as in his discretion may be
deemed necessary or advisable to protect and
maintain the credit and financial position of
the Dominion or any province thereof. This
clause has given rise to considerable contention in the other House, and it may give rise
to contention here. At the moment I am
merely emphasizing the point that it seeks
to shift only a certain specific power which
under our Constitution belongs to Parliament.
The Government of the day feels it necessary
that between sessions it should have that
power, which, as interpreted by the courts
of our country, has a restricted and welldefined meaning. It is not as though Parliament were asked to declare that the powers
given it by section 91 of the British North
America Act should one and all be exercised
by the Government between sessions. That
would be equivalent to wiping out Parliament. But when only one power is transferred-a powër under which contingencies
may be controlled or taken care of, and which
has a well-defined and limited application
already thoroughly established by jurisprudence-the case is entirely different. It
is ali a question of whether or not the House
feels that conditions, improved as they ar2,
are still such that, by reason of what may be.
doubtful experiments launched elsewhere and
the general uncertainty of the present time,
the Government is justified in asking to be
clothed with this power.
It can truly be said in defence of the application that a similar power vested in the
administration for two years, if not three, has
not been abused. A report of everything
done under that power has been laid before
both Houses of Parliament. Furthermore,
I think it can be said, not only that the
power has not been abused-, but that in one
year, if not in two, it was essential in the
interest of the Dominion that it be exercised
by the Government.
I think it will be possible for me to give
information as to the general conditions and
the whole subject of relief: obligations entered into, and with whom; the extent to
which those obligations have been complied
with; the division of appropriations among
the various objectives sought-food, clothing
and the like-and the extent to which the
powers under the former Acts, relative to
adivances to the provinces, enabled them to
take care of the obligations they entered into.
These advances, which are returnable, are
very extensive in the Western Provinces.
The whole burden has indeed been a trying
one, and to handicap those who have to
carry it is to make their task intolerably
difficult. There have been impositions upon

265

the organization of the Federal Government.
Some have been discovered by its own officials, and in this connection very large sums
have been returned to the treasury. To
others attention has been called, and I suppose
we must assume properly so, by the AuditorGeneral. Whenever a new establishment is
created, especially one where of necessity
large sums of money are passing to and fro,
it is exceedingly difficult to avoid abuses.
Undoubtedly abuses have occurred, largely
by reason of the grasping character of individuals within the municipalities. Sometimes, I fear, this voracity must be attributed to the municipalities themselves,
though in some degree it may have been
due to a lack of complete and efficient supervision on the part of the provincial administrations. In relation to the total, however,
the margin of error has not been large; and
hour by hour, month by month, it has been
reduced. On the whole, it seems to me, a
depression of fearful magnitude bas been
fairly well taken care of, and, from the
standpoint of honour, wholly without criticism so far as the Federal Administration
is concerned.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I do not
rise to criticize in any way the general
economy of the Bill. We know what its purpose is, and that it is but a continuation of a
policy approved by Parliament during the
last two or three sessions. But it is necessary
to give a little closer examination to section
3, to which my right honourable friend bas
referred as the contentious clause, which
clothes the Governor in Council with exceptional powers, when Parliament ýis not in
session, for the maintenance of peace, order
and good government throughout Canada.
In order that we may be better able to judge
whether this section is necessary, I should
like my right honourable friend to tell us
of all instances where these powers have
been used, and in what direction and to what
extent, since they were first authorized by
Parliament. When the Government first
asked for the authorization it was on the
ground that we were living in times of extraordinary economic difficulties and that the
existence of great numbers of unemployed
people made it essential to provide that
special steps might be taken on short notice.
However, we certainly have passed through
the most difficult period of the crisis, and if
in fact there has been no occasion when it
was deemed necessary to utilize these special
powers, I doubt whether it is proper to continue to vest the Government with them.
Perhaps my right honourable friend could
also tell us what, if any, measures have been

20ti

SENATE

taken under the authority of the latter part
of section 3 to protect and maintain the
credit and financial position of the Dominion
or any province. He may find it easier to
answer this question, because any such measures could only have been taken, I suppose,
after subsidies had been granted or the banks
had been given guarantees.
But I am principally concerned to know
what use bas been made of the powers provided for by the first part of the section.
I think that section 4 also calls for some
explanations. It reads:
Without restricting the generality of the
ternis of the next preceding section hereof and
notwithstanding the provisions of any statute
or law, the Governor in Council may
(a) Provide for special relief, works and
undertakings under control and direction of
the Department of National Defence and the
Departnent of the Interior;
(b) Take all such other measures as may be
deemed necessary or advisable for carrying out
the provisions of this Act.
The right honourable gentleman has told us
what in the main bas been done by the
Department of National Defence, and by the
Department of the Interior through its camps
in national parks. I should like to know
whether these are the only departments that
have carried on special relief works. The
section does not authorize any special undertakings by the Department of Public Works,
for example, but I suppose that department
would have charge of any general program
of public works that might be carried on
under the provisions of separate legislation.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX:
Honourable members, I will not attempt to raise a
constitutional issue on this Bill. Thiat matter
has been threshed out in another place. As
a member of the Senate I am bound to support the Government on a measure of this
kind, for I take it to be the will of the people
that some special relief legislation be passed
to help tide our country over the existing
crucial period. But may I suggest that when
the Government makes relief funds available
to provinces, or to municipalities through the
instrumentality of provinces, there should be
imposed a condition that the unemployed who
receive any of the moneys shall perform at
least some work therefor. Nothing is the
cause of greater concern to our citizens in
general, and especially to our taxpayers, than
the fact that great numbers of people regularly receive public money for the support
of themselves and their families, and yet refuse to work. This is true in our large centres,
such as Montreal, Three Rivers and possibly,
though to a lesser extent, Quebec. I regret
to say that in Montreal, my native city, the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

distribution of relief funds without requiring
any service from the recipients of them bas
resulted in the creation of a large class of
mendicants and idlers who will be with us
for many years to come.
I think the rigbt honourable leader of the
House will agree with me when I say that in
all our big cities there are great numbers of
people who believe it is unnecessary for thern
to work-that the state must support them.
If I read the newspapers aright, Toronto cannot be excepted from the cities of which this
is true. I submit to honourable members
that such a condition comes pretty near to
Communism, and even to Bolshevism. It is
high time that we set out to restore respect
for the old principle that an honest man
must earn the money he receives. Of course
I am making reference not to the. aged, the
infirm and the sick, nor to poor orphans and
widows, but to an unfortunately large proportion of those people who are being helped by
relief funds. I repeat that the Federal Government should not band out large sums for
relief without requiring that regulations be
framed to force the recipients to work. All
honourable members work, as the bulk of our
people do. I never expected that I could live
without working. Why should we promote
a desire for idleness among large sections of
our people?
It is surprising how doggedly some people
will hold to the notion that the state must
provide for them. I was reading in the press
last night of a gentleman in Montreal who
could not pay his rent. and wbo transferred
his household effects, which included a little
stove, to the sidewalk. He has been living
out in the open for about ten days, though
he has some money, for he sends children to
the stores to purchase his meat, bread and
butter. He 'contends that the city must supply
him with a bouse, and declares ho will not
leave the sidewalk until one year's rental is
paid in advanice for him by the municipality.
Honourable members may smile at that, but
if they read Montreal papers of last evening
they will find I am not romancing.
Unfortunately the lack of self-reliance is
widespread to-day. The time bas come when
people who have no desire to work must be
taught to realize that money does not flow
frorn the printing press, but can be obtained
only through taxation of their fellow-citizens
who work for a living. It must be made clear
to idlers that they will have to render some
service by way of at least partial compensation for the sums given to them.
When the Bill is in Committee of the
Whole I may have some suggestions to offer.

APRIL 18, 1934
Speaking generally, I think the motion for
second reading should pass.
Hon. H. C. HOCKEN: Honourable senators, I agree with manst of what was said by
tbe honourable gentleman wba bas just sat
down about the development ai the mendicant spirit, and, like him, I greatly deplore
that develapment. But what are we ta do
in the present situation? We are faced with
a problem greater than any other we have
ever had in Canada. In my own city oi
Toronto we have as ordinarily decent a
population as can be found anywhere.
Seventy per cent af the houses there are
awned by their' ocupants, a fact which indicates that the people are thrifty. Yet there
is owing for unpaid municipal taxes about
$12,0,000, a large propartion af wrhich sum
is outstanding against these very bouses.
What cen be dane witb the owners? They
are thrifty and industriaus people. Week
by week and mantb by .mantb they have put
aside the little savings wbicb bave enabled
them gradually ta acquire their homes, but
naw they are without work and have fia means
ai paying taxes. Citizens ai that kind canflot be allowed ta starve. There are fia better
people in the country, and they must be
taken care af.
I would inform my honourable friend fram
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) that even
in the days af prasperity the city ai Toronto
found it necessary to maintain, tbraugh its
House ai Industry, from five ta six thousand
families every year. I speak with some
knowledge af the situation, for I bad more
or less responsibility in connectian with it.
And as far back as twenty years ago we were
faced with a prablem ai wbat ta do witb
people who would nat work. In those times
nearly everyone wbo desired employment
could find it, but in a population of 500,000
or mare there will always be a considerable
number ai idlers.
In former times people who would nat work
subsisted on the most meagre allowance the
city could give tbem, but at the present time
relief is given in such comparatively generaus
measure that it is taken withaut humiliation
by good citizens, témporarily out ai einployment, wbo in the pa7st have always supported
Vbemselves or at least managed ta live with
the occasional assistance ai friends. It used
ta be considered humiliating ta go ta the
House ai Industry and get a week's provisions. That is nat s0 ta-day, and the change
is flot altagether the fault af the people concerned. I have seen well-dressed young men
ai thirty-five and forty going ta the House
af Industry with a suitease, in wbich tbey

267

would bring away food enough to last them
and their families for a week.
Such incidents are evidence of a sad state
of affairs, but it is a state of affairs with
which we have to deal. Whatever it is necessary for the municipal, provincial and
federal authorities to do in order to prevent
people from starving, mnust be donc. There
is no getting away from that. In my opinion
the ultimate resuit of the present condition
will be the establishment af some kind of
unemployment insurance. Just what form it
will take I arn not trying ta suggest, but I
think it shiould be on a contributory basis.
The amounts payable ta contributors who
become unemployed should be large enough
only ta provide for subsistence and to ensure
that they and their children shall have enough
ta eat.
In Toronto, as I have said, people who are
on relief are unable ta get enaugh monýey ta
pay their rent. As a consequence-I arn
speaking of my own city because I arn iamiliar
with conditions there-a great number af
landiords, receiving no rent, cannot pay their
taxes. The unemployment situation, taken as
a whole, is most desperate. And s0 long as
present conditions exist the Government must
undertake ta look after the unfortunate who
are in need because af inability ta obtain
work. I venture ta say, honourable members,
that it is beyond the powers af any man ta
compute the total value af private benevolence
exeroised throughout this cauntry in the last
three yeaxs. Elderly men and women have
taken ànto their homes their married sons and
daughters so, that they should have enough ta
eat and drink, and a place ai shelter, without
gaing on relief. The sums that have been paid
by aur variaus governments for relief are
enarmous. In Taronto it bas been necessary
ta issue bonds ta raise the funds required.
Yet I imagine th(at this vast public expenditure has not been nearly as large as the total
value ai private benevalence.
As I have said, we must deal with conditions as we find bhem. I believe that the
present Administration recagnizes the seriausness ai the situation and is daing its best ta,
cape with it. It is, I submit, the duty af
tbis honourable body ta support the Gavernment in this effort, flot niggardly, but
generously, and without criticism of minor
points. Reeagnizing the tremendous pToblem,
we should accept tbe best solution that the
Government can offer.
I think I may go this far, honourable mernbers: the time is ripe for Canada ta undertake some plan of industrial reconstruction.
Some Han. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: This, in my opinion,
would involve a minimum wage for men and
subsistence from an unemployment fund. I
would give a minimum wage to men as well
as to women.
It should be fixed at an
amount sufficient to maintain an unskilled
labourer and his wife and family. If trades
unions claimed for their members more than
the minimum wage, the matter should be
dealt with by an industrial tribunal wbieh
would function more effectiv ely than is possible under present legislation.
I have other ideas, but I think I have said
enough to indicate that we are at the beginning of a period of industrial reconstruction
in which the man who works witb his bands
must get consideration, and capital must be
willing to make some contribution towards
his maintenance when he is unemployed. In
Great Britain the unemployed are looked
after by what is known as the dole, or unemployment insurance. The working manto whose class I hope we all belong-will
have to be treated a little better than he
bas been in the past, and in return he must
be willing to give a good day's work for a
fair day's wage-whicb is not always the case
at present, I am sorry to say.
At some future date I hope to express more
fully my views on industrial reconstruction.
For the present I must content myself with
these few remarks, whiclh my honourable
friend's speech bas prompted me to make.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I owe
it to the honourable gentlemen who have
spoken to answer the questions addressed te
me. I am very glad this motion bas evoked
such speeches from the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hocken) and the
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.
Mr. Lemieux), as well as the honourable
senator opposite me (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
whom I almiost failed to refer te because,
strange te say, in this matter bis mind and
my own are very often in the same groove.
I am especially glad to have a word te say
with regard to the points brought forward by
the honourable senator from Rougemont, and
amplified somewhat by the bonourable senator
behind me (Hon. Mr. Hocken).
It is truc that the distribution of relief on
so wide a scale during the past four years
has had the effect of making it commonplace,
instead of rare and disgraceful. As a consequence there bas developed over the whole
land an atmosphere favourable to the idea
of accepting relief as the basis of livelihood,
rather than to the adage, which bas come
down through the centuries, that only by toil
may man live.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN.

If there has been errer in the administration of relief-I am sorry to have te give
expression te this view; a different one, if
I could accept it honestly, would be welcome
to me-the errer is that relief bas been
granted on too generous a scale. It is not
that the country, if every feature of the
organization were right, could net possibly
afford it, but that the effect upon recipients
bas been demoralizing. I know that to-day
there are tens of thousands of honest, bardworking men cager te toil, but unable te get
work. There are net so many as there were,
but there are still great numbers of them.
The great difficulty is to be fair to them witnout at the same time multiplying the numbers of those who never have worked and
never want te work. Unless we keep the
level of subsistence for the out-of-works
lower than we should like it te be for those
desiring employment, we are every day multiplying the number of idlers. Keep the level
fairly up se that they can live comfortably
and we find crowding into those lower ranks
of the non-workers men who before would
never dream of seeking assistance along the
road of life. We have te keep a low standard
of maintenance or we are going to increase
the number of out-of-works and won't-works.
At the same time we bave to take care not
to err by going too far in that direction;
otherwise we do a grave injustice te many
honest people who want to earn their living.
The regulations cannot be too strict for the
man who will net work. No matter what the
work is, it is a duty to do one's utmost at
it until a better class of work is available;
but the man who will do nothing, or is
exceedingly selective about the class of work
he will do, cannot be kept at to low a level
of subsistence compatible with the maintenance of life.
The lesson that the honourable senator
from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) is trying te drive home is growing more important
day by day, for work is becoming available
in greater volume, and we can more readily
make it net only incumbent, but imperative,
upon everybody te show he has refused nothing and bas donc his utmost to obtain work,
the alternative being a very low standard of
subsistence.
Nothing more 'terrible could
happen this country than that social services
should proceed so far as to lift from the back
of the individual his perpetual responsibility
to take care of himself.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr.

APRIL 18, 1934
Hocken) feels we are going to have to do
more along the lines of unemployment insurance and the like. Maybe we are, but
personally I hope we shall not have to. I
have never been an enthusiast even for old
age pensions. No one would recoil more
than I from leaving anybody in want in his
old age. We never have done so. We have
taken care of needy cases in old folks' homes
and similar institutions. But to indigence
there -must be a measure of disgrace attached;
not by way of penalty, but because it is
essential to the law of life. Otherwise conditions would become dreadful. Even now
children in a position to care for their parents
refuse to do so. Women who have assisted
their brothers to make a fortune become old
age pensioners to get so much more out of
the Government. Abuse follows abuse over
the whole range if we do not put relief on
the basis of charity. Instead of keeping it
where a measure of disgrace attaches to it,
we have elevated it to the stratum where the
recipients treat relief as their right, as something due to them although they have not
earned it. As a consequence it is becoming
more and more difficult to shut the door to
abuse. I know a great deal can be said on
the other side of the question, but it is
essential now to take care that we do not so
far expand social services as to disintegrate
the moral fibre of our people.
Now I will try to answer the questions
addressed to me by the honourable senator
opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). The first
question relates to clause 3 of the Bill. It
gives the peace-order-and-good-government
power between sessions to the Administration,
which is in each case answerable to Parliament. The honourable senator asks what is
the need of this power now, and particularly
what in the past has been donc in exercise
of the authority similarly given by previous
legislation to take all such measures for peace,
order and good government as in the discretion of the Governor in Council have been
"deemed necessary or advisable to protect and
maintain the credit and financial position of
the Dominion or any province thereof."
The first instance that would come to one's
mind of what has been done under the peaceorder-and-good-government power would be,
of course, the guarantees and advances made
to protect the Western Provinces from bankruptcy. No one knows what would have been
the effect on Canadian credit had the Western
Provinces not been supported very generously.
As honourable members are aware, very large
advances have been made to those provinces
throughout the period of depression. Certainly the impact upon the credit of Canada

269

would have been terrifie, and its effect would
have been almost interminable.
But I cannot cite this as coming strictly
within clause 3, or as being an answer to the
question put by the honourable senator
opposite, for the reason that all this could
have been done under the preceding section,
which bas appeared also in the other bills.
But if I am asked what in other years the
Government has found necessary to do strictly
under the peace-order-and-good-government
clause, I refer to Privy Council Order No.
2617, passed on October 19, 1931, prohibiting
the exportation of gold. On September 21,
1931, Great Britain went off the gold standard.
There was something that could not have been
foreseen. There had been no specific provision looking to this contingency, and the
Government had to act under the peace-orderand-good-government clause. A more specific
and enlightening argument in support of the
clause could hardly be imagined. Britain
suddenly went off the gold standard, this
deranged our currency, and the only supporting policy available to the Government was
the prohibition of gold export. It proved
quite effective, and is still in force.
Is it at all inconceivable that something of
a similar character might occur within the
next year? To me it is quite conceivable.
I admit it is unlikely. But we do not know
just what is going to be the working-out of
the very new, very courageous and, to my
mind, in almost every way very admirable
efforts that are now under the test of experience in the United States. We do not know
what may take place. An entirely new situation might be precipitated. There have been
many more disturbances of the peace over
there than here. We do not look to the continuance of this state of affairs; we have
every reason to hope that better conditions
are going to obtain; but it is well to have the
Government armed, and it should not be a
matter of very great concern or anxiety to us
to have the Government so armed. Every
honourable member will admit that in the
past year the power has been exercised only
when it has been clearly shown to be to the
advantage of Canada to exercise it.
Another instance occurred on October 27,
1931, when it became necessary to authorize
the valuation of securities in bank returns
under section 112 of the Bank Act. I would
refer to a similar step taken on December 31,
1931, under exactly the same power, giving
authority to the Superintendent of Insurance
regarding the valuation of securities of insurance companies in the returns submitted to
him under the provisions of the Insurance Act.
Nearly all honourable members, if not all,

SENATE
know the significance of those two administrative acts. Had it had not been possible
for the Government to take them, what in
those dark hours might have been the effect
upon the bank structure of our country? It
does not require the slightest effort of the
imagination to disclose what would have been
the effect on the insurance structure of Canada
if the second regulation had not been within
the power of the Government to impose. I
frankly admit that during the year 1934 it
is not likely that necessity for such steps will
arise, but it is by no means impossible.
Now, we clearly define the limit within
which we can act. It is the power stipulated
as federal under section 91 of the British
North America Act, within which and under
which in other years we have acted to the
great advantage of Canada. I know it is the
disposition of the Senate of Canada to confer
the same power for the current year.
The honourable senator made reference as
well to section 4, and asked what was being
done thereunder. He stated that details had
.been given of the works being performed by
the Department of National Defence, and the
Department of the Interior through the National Parks Branch. I cannot give the exact
items of construction, but there is upon the
table of this House a report by Mr. Hereford,
the chief officer of the Relief Branch, giving
every detail that could be asked for.
The honourable senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) asked what is being done
to get some return in toil for the relief
granted. These camps are the answer. There
the men have to do a specific amount of work
each day. They get certain things beyond the
range of mere subsistence, and twenty cents a
day. Necessarily this avenue of support is
available only to single men. You cannot
take married men from their families and
place them in militia camps under discipline;
but it is not too much to ask of single men,
and consequently it is the field in which this
relief has principally been given. Honourable
members have read, and probably have heard,
severe criticisms of these camps.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I have heard good reports.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: I have heard
the best reports, and it is my experience
that the more intelligent the informer the
better the report. But who has not heard
these loud screams against "slave camps"? In
our cities some people are roaring about them
every week, and are getting encouragement
from certain newspapers whose main interests
lie along the line of circulation. Consequently
there is always a measure of social disturbRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

ance when any force of legislation or administrative power is applied to compel
people to work. That is the difficulty in the
way of doing more along the line of the
request of the honourable gentleman from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux). I agree
with the honourable senator from King's
(Hon. Mr. Hughes). In the whole history
of our relief administration nothing bas been
more creditable than these very camps of the
Department of National Defence and the
Department of the Interior.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

FRUIT AND

HONEY BILL

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

Hon. iMr. DONNELLY, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry, presented the report of the Committee on Bill 26, an Act respecting Fruit
and Honey, and moved concurrence therein.
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If there is
no objection, I should like te have the Bill
read the third time now. The next sitting
of the House will net be until next week.
If anyone so desires, we can go into Committee on the Bill. It has already been before
the Committee on Agriculture, and I am sure
the Chairman of that Committee would be
glad to explain any feature of it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Carried.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: There is one clause
of this Bill to which I wish to call attention,
and I think we might better go into Committee of the Whole.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

All right.

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeLennan in the Chair.
On section 2-definitions:
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Honourable members, as I said before, this Bill was submitted

APIL 19, 1934
to the Standing Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry. Mr. McIntosh, representing
the Department of Agriculture, appeared before the Committee and gave a clear and
full explanation of different parts of the
Bill.
The maeasure is in tbree parts. The first
part authorizes the Minister to make regulations in respect to grades, packing, inspection, and so on, The purpose of the second
part is to authorize the department to license
brokers and commission bouses dcaling in
fruits and vegetables. By way of showing the
necessity for such liccnsing, the representative
of the dcpartmcnt told us of an instance of
a fruit brokerage firma having gone into
liquidation, and the consequential loss of
many thousands of dollars by consignors of
fruit. The concern reorganized under another
name, and later made a second assignmient.
Now it is reorganized for the third time.
The departmcnt proposes to meet such cases
by bonding brokers and commission men who
deal in fruit and vegetables. The amount
of the bond suggestcd was around $10,000,
and I understand the intention is that the
licence f ce should be mcrely nominal.
The third part of the Bill provides for the
grading, inspection and assembling of honey
for export. It makes applicable to boncy
certain conditions similar to those wbich now
apply to fruit.
The honourable gentleman from Quecn's
(Hon. Mr. Sinclair) has asked a question
whîch. I believe refers to subsection k of section 37. This section provides:
The Mînister may from time to time inake
regulations:
(k) to prescribe punishmcnt for the violation
of any regulation including maximum and
minimum fines not exceeding two hundred
dollars -and imprisonnment not excecding one
month for default in paymient of any such fine.
The point raised by the honourable gentleman, as I understand it, is that the minimum
fine in each instance should be fixcd by the
magistrate before whom the case is tried. The
maximum is fixed by the subsection. I think
the honourable gentleman would like to bave
the opinion of the right honourable leader on
that point.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Pcrhaps it
would be better to take up the Bill clause by
clause.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agrced to.
On section 4-grading, packing, etc., to be
according to Act and regulations:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Would any of
these regulations conflict with provincial
regulations?

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am unable
to answcr tbat question dcfinitely. The House
will sec that the Bill deals with interprovincial
trade. I note especially that the heading of
Part II is "Licensing of Interprovincial
Traders." I sbould not care to take the responsibility of saying that a comparison of
the provisions of this measure with provincial
acts would show neither duplication nor conflict, but I presume tbat question was given
duc consideration by tbc dcpartment when
the drafting was being donc.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The Committee
was assured by the representative of the
dcpartment that if there was any confiict
between the federal and the provincial
authorities the matter would be adjusted
bctween thcm.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: If Parliament
passes an Act that confiets with provincial
legislation, the dcpartmcnt cannot change it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Would this section
apply to imported fruit?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: To imported fruit of a
kind or varicty grown in Canada, tbe departmental representative told us tbis morning.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEýN: Wcll, that can
be lookcd aftcr alI rigbt.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5--fraudulent grading:
Hon. Mr..McMEANS: I am not objecting
to the section, but I sbould like a littie furtber
information. Would these provisions apply,
for instance, to strawbcrrics, gooseberries, and
other fruit grown at home and offered for sale
on tbe markets?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In interprovincial trade, ycs.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If a man grew fruit
in his own garden, and offercd it for sale on
the market, would hie come under these regulations?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: If it was offered
for sale outside his own province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The purport
ýof the Bill is the regulation of interprovincial
trade. I think it goes no further. The
measure can be justified constitutionally only
on the ground of jurisdiction in trade and
commerce, but that cannot be carried so far
as to interfere with property and civil rights.
If any honourable member feels that the Bill
in any way cxceeds that jurisdictîon, I should
be glad to have the matter pointed out.
Section 5 was agreed to.
Sections 6 to 21, inclusive, werc agreed to.

SENATE

On section 22-offences against sections 4
te 15:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This section
deals with penalties for specifie offences. I
understand the point raised by the honourable
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) bas
to do with paragraph k of section 37, by
which the Minister is given power to make,
among other regulations, the following:
to prescribe punishment for the violation
of any regulation including maximum and
minimum fines not exceeding two hundred
dollars and imprisonment not exceeding one
nonth for default in payment of any such fine.
The House will appreciate the honourable
senator's point. Section 22 prescribes maximum and minimum penalties for certain
offences; but section 37 gives the Minister
power to do the same tbing. Paragrapb k
of section 37 would appear to overlap section
22.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
te honey only.

Section 37 relates

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, Part
III relates only to honey. It is pretty difficult to understand wliy Parliament has te
fix the penalty in relation to fruit, while
the Minister lias te do so in relation to honey.
Section 42 bas
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
relation to both honey and fruit.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I felt it was important that the duties of the Minister should
be discussed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
section is all riglt.
Section 22 was agreed to.

Then this

On section 23-detention of fruit:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This section
empowers an inspector te detain fruit until
the package is made te comply with the law.
Fruit is perishable, and if you are going to
detain it very long you might as well give il
to the poor.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
the power is necessary in order that the Act
may be made effective.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The fruit could be,
destroyed if in an unfit condition.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Watermelons keep
a long time.
Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: It depends on
the population. I am not orthodox. To my
mind we already have too many regulations
to restrict trade.
Section 23 was agreed to.
Sections 24 to 27, inclusive, were agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

On section 28-appointment of inspectors:
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Does the passage
of this Bill involve the appointment of a large
corps of inspectors throughout the country?
It seems to me we are pretty nearly inspected
to death already.
Right Hon. Mr. 'GRAHAM:
opinion.

That is my

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
use in enacting legislation if there is no one
to enforce its provisions.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: There are already
a good many inspectors who might have these
duties added to those they do net now perform.
Hon. Mr. LYNOHtSTAUNTON: We have
in one factory in Hamilton nineteen inspeotors. We can spare some of them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
their services can be used.

Probabiy

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The departmental
officials explained that inspection under the
Fruit Act, as under the Vegetable Act, is pad
for by a carload fee. It is not a charge upon
the revenues.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps the
chairman of the standing committee which
dealt with this Bill (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
could tell us what was said by the officer of
the department as to whether the present
inspectors would be available.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I do net remember
his making any statement in regard to it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As I read this Bill,
the Civil Service Commission will determine
when appointments shall be made.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Undoubtedly.
But I am wondering whether under this section the Minister can, without reference to
the Civil Service Commission, devolve the
duties upon a man already in the department.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Oh, yes; there is a
corps of inspectors.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Suppose John
Smith is an inspector in the Department of
Agriculture and not too busy. Can the Minister appoint him, or has the appointment to
be made by the Civil Service Commission?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If my right honourable friend will look at the Act of 1927 be
will find therein a section similar to section 28.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: How was it
worked?

APRIL 19, 1934
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Department of
Agriculture has a considerable corps of inspectors doing similar work under the old
Act. Presumably the duties under this Act
will be performed by those inspectors.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No doubt
they will be continued.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: At the meeting of the
standing committee this morning a representative of the Department of Agriculture,
in answer to the question whether any grower
would be hindered through being too far away
from the present inspectors, said the country
was divided into six districts, and, if required,
inspectors would be available without any
undue delay.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And the inspectors are now at work?
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: My understanding was
that there would be no new inspectors put
on, but that the old ones would do this work.
Section 28 was agreed to.
On section 29-Act repealed:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I suppose it is contrary to the
rules of the House to speak against the principle of a Bill in Committee of the Whole,
but if you will permit me I should like to
express my views with regard to this tinkering
at interprovincial trade. Each province is
treating every other province almost as though
it were a foreign country. Take a man living
in Ottawa, for instance, who wants to sell
his goods in the province of Quebec, say in
the city of Hull. If he sells in the city of
Hull he is subject to a restriction that does
not apply if he sells in the city of Ottawa.
Under this Bill the reverse should be the case.
If each province makes laws that interfere
with interprovincial trade the country is
going to be divided up into separate entities,
which will be a source of weakness instead of
strength. Honourable gentlemen will remember the legislation that prevented the bringing of liquor from one province into another.
A man coming into Ontario with liquor from
the province of Quebec was subject to a
penalty, and vice versa. I believe that
trade, at least that between provinces of the
Dominion of Canada, should be free and unrestricted. These little pin pricks that we
are delivering to each other, particularly when
we are looking for all the trade we can get,
are not, I am sure, in the best interest of the
country.

273

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If my right honourable friend from Eganville would take the
time to look into the principle of the Bill, I
think he would not take the view he does.
This Bill applies to inspection and grading,
and will be of benefit to trade. It has been
asked for by all the organizations and merchants dealing in fruit. A list of these was
given to the Committee this morning by the
Fruit Commissioner. The clause in regard to
detention refers only to fruit that has not a
certificate of grade attached to the bill of
lading. If a certificate is attached, it is not
an offence to ship the fruit. The same system
of inspection applies to vegetables under
another Act, and has been of great benefit
to the producer, the wholesaler, the dealer,
the. purchaser and others, because it does
away with the shipping of perishable products
that are not worth shipping. When this
certificate is attached there is no trouble if
the consignees object to the grade; the shipper
can call upon the inspection service for a
reinspection at destination, and have the
grade established.
I heartily support the Bill with the exception of the clause that I referred to in the
committee. As there was no member of the
legal profession on the committee dealing
with the Bill, I thought it well that this point
should be brought up in the House.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am not quite
certain that I understand the situation,
and if I can, I should like to secure
some information. At first I was under the
impression that this was an entirely new
Bill, but I understand now that it is simply
a revision of the old law. We grade all
sorts of things that are handled commercially,
such as hay, wheat, beef, fish and so on; so

there is nothing new in placing a restriction
on things of this kind. It is done in the
public interest, and as has just been said by
the honourable senator from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair), it is in the interest of the
grower and of the dealer as well. So, as I
understand it, we are not restricting trade
by this measure, but are improving conditions
so f ar as the right kind of trade is concerned.
I should like to know whether this Bill
proposes any new plans or schemes that were
not provided for under the old law.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: This is not an
amending Bill. Sections 1 to 29 take the place
of the provisions of the existing law on the
same subject. This Bill is supposed by the
department to be an improvement on the
Act.

74728-18
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
With reference to the objection raised by
the right honourable senator from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) I may say that
Part II of the Bill deals not with inspection,
but with the bonding and licensing of commission bouses and brokers carrying on interprovincial trade.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Is this new?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I think it is.
Very good reasons were given for the bonding
of such commission houses and brokers.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The position of the
department was made clear this morning. It
was stated that some six thousand copies of
this Bill had been distributed among the
various growers and the fruit organizations
throughout Canada, and they were all perfectly satisfied with its provisions. That being
se, I do not see why we should make any
change in it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If we look at the
explanatory note opposite paragraph g of
section 3, we find that the purpose of this
paragraph is to enable the growers or shippers
of any province to avail themselves of compulsory grades or compulsory inspection, or to
provide necessary restrictions in the movement of fruit which might be detrimental to
the interests of the growers. I distinctly remember that some years ago a great clameur
was raised in the province of British Columbia
for something of that kind. It was said that
fruit from the State of Washington and other
places was being dumped into the province.
As one who once had a little to do with the
fruit business, I think this Bill, so far as I
have been able to analyse it, will reasonably
conserve the rights of the growers and shippers
in each of the provinces of Canada.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The main purpose
of this part of the Bill is to protect the fruit
grower from being defrauded by the commission agent.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am afraid this
is a mistake. I have in mind the great discontent that arose in connection with three
carloads of fruit from the State of Washington
that were landed in British Columbia, one of
which was sent te Calgary, one te Edmonton
and one to Regina. It seems to me that the
shipper can defeat the intent of this law
by inscribing on the package the name of
some other individual and representing him
to be the person who is sending the fruit.
Anything less than five carloads can go
through free. I do net think that is right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest
that we let this clause stand. I do net
understand it.
Section 30 stands.
Sections 31 te 33, inclusive, were agreed te.
On section 34-regulations:
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: There is a point
heore that I think is worthy of the consideration of the House. Honourable members
will notice that under paragraph a the Minister is given power
-to

prescribe the conditions respecting applica-

tions for and the issue of licences. the duration

of same and the fees to be paid therefor.
In the committee I raised a question as te
the amount of the fee, and the official of
the department said it would be substantial.
I think it should be a nominal fee. Departmental control can be exercised by the bonding right and the refusal te issue licences
rather than by means of a substantial fee,
which would increase the cost of distribution.

Section 29 was agreed to.
On section 30-definitions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: These clauses
are new, I understand.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A "dealer"
does not have to sell as many carloads as a
"retail dealer." Those definitions would seem
to be reversed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
the purpose of the Bill is to control the wholesale handling of fruit, and if a retail dealer
is in business in such a small way that ho
does net handle ten carloads he is exempt and
does net require a licence.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
right.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

That is all

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot
contest the wisdom of the honourable senator's
view, but I think the clause is best which
gives the Minister power te fix the conditions
under which applications shall be received,
licences granted, and fees paid. The fees
will vary. As to whether they should be large
or small, probably the view of the honourable senator is right.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: The Commissioner suggested that the fees would be from $30 to

$100.
Right Hon. Mr.
pretty high, too.

MEIGHEN:

Section 34 was agreed te.
Section 35 was agreed te.

That

APRIL 19, 1934
On section 36-definition:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This refers
to "export" from one province to another?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Or outside
of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do not like
to see that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator is quite right. Because of our
federal systern we have drifted into very dangerous by-paths in leaving each province to
look after itself. Not long ago we had one
province saying, through its Prime Minister,
that its neighbour should not sell it so-and-so.
I should like to name the article, but if I
did I might identify the province. That sort
of thing leads to retaliation, the other province saying, " We are not going to let any
contract to a firm in your province." That
is exactly what should not take place; but I
do not know how, with our Constitution as
it is to-day, we are going to avoid it. Only
the Federal Parliament can control interprovincial trade, as is sought to be done by
this Bill, but the provinces can make laws
as to buying and selling within their own
boundaries. In consequence we have built
up in this country interrelated systems which
are complicated and altogether out of barmony with conditions of trade. That method
of control may be all right in matters of
language, education and religion, but in the
realm of business and finance it is cumbersome, grotesque, monstrous--just as unsuitable as a fur coat on a hot day in July.
Does not the
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
British North America Act say that there
shall be free trade between the provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. But
even aside from tariffs you cannot have absolute freedom in regard to trade any more
than you can in regard to property and social
relations. You must have discipline; you
must establish moral principles that are
acceptable everywhere. Freedom cannot exist
in the sphere of social relations, and conditions are pretty much the same in the
sphere with which we are dealing.
Section 36 was agreed to.
On section 37-regulations:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In paragraph k
we come to the point raised by the honourable
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair). I
do not doubt that this method of providing
for penalties has been adopted before, but I
think it is not a good one. The law should
74728-1SJ

state the maximum and the minimum punishment, and in every individual case the magistrate ought to exercise bis discretion. By section 22 Parliament fixes the range of penalties
for offences with respect to fruit. Why should
the responsibility be transferred to the Minister when honey is involved?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is nearly
as absurd as the use of the word "export."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, pretty
nearly. I am sure the Chairman of the Committee will be glad to confer again with the
departmental official, and reconvene the Committee if necessary, so as to have this section
reframed to specify both maximum and minimum terms. I do not know what fines would
be appropriate, but I think there would be
no difficulty in deciding upon them if such
a conference as I have suggested were held.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: And at the same time
could not something be done to eliminate the
word "export" as applying to trade between
provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course it
does not matter what name is applied to the
trade, but that term does seem inappropriate.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is not customary to call interprovincial trade "exports."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. It would
be better to have the word changed. I do not
think it is wise to embalm in legislation the
designation of a transfer of commodities from
Ontario to Quebec, for instance, as an export.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: Does not section 42
apply in this conneetion?
Right Hon. Mr. MFIGHEN: The objection is only to the use of the word "export."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We shall soon
have an immigration policy applying between
one province and another.
Section 37 stands.
Sections 38 to 42, inclusive, were agreed to.
Progress was reported.

RELIEF BILL
CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 42, an
Act respecting Relief Measures.
Hon. Mr. Gillis in the Chair.
On section 2-agreements with provinces:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
This is a
very important section. It authorizes, among
other things, the granting of financial assistance to Canadian Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited. This is, as everyone knows,
the organization now being managed by Mr.
McFarland, which was formed to take care
of the sales of the different wheat pools in
the West. Some years ago-I think it was
in 1931-the pools found themselves in a
rather difficult situation, and this sell.ing
medium was organized to enable them to
carry through. The interests of farmers, and
more particularly of grain growers, werc
deeply and vitally involved, and the 'Government had to come to the rescue, because
there were provincial commitments which
could not be taken care of and it was necessary to provide finances on a very large -scale
in order to avoid collapses which would bave
been disastrous to grain producers. I think
this section 2 is the same as the corresponding section in the relief measures of previous
years.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Wbeat
Pool was not a great success, was it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. It did
not measure up to the high-sounding terms
of the manifesto.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-further powers of Governor
in Council:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Are there any
further powers that could be given to the
'Governor in Council?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. This
section does nothing more than confer upon
the Governor in Council the powers that are
covered by one clause of section 91 of the
British North America Act.
There is no
attempt here to follow the example of one
of the provinces, in which between sessions of
the Legislature the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council has all the powers enumerated in
section 92.
Section 4 was agreed to.
Section 5 was agreed to.

APRIL 19, 1934
On section 6-orders and regulations:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
change whatever in these sections.
Section 6 was agreed ta.
On section 7-enforcement of orders and
regulations:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is just
the same as before.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8-orders and regulations laid
before Parliament:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is the
same also.
Section 8 was agreed to.
On section 9-report to Parliament:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
change here either.
Section 9 was agreed to.
On section 10-payment of delayed accounts
in excess of amount authorized:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The purpose
of this section is to authorize the payment
this year of obligations incurred in the
previous year, for which accounts may be
received after March 31, notwithstanding that
the payment of such accounts may cause the
total expenditure for relief granted last year
to exceed the sum voted. I cannot state the
exact amount by which the accounts will exceed the appropriation, nor am I sure that
there will actually be any excess. Details in
this respect were, I think, given in another
place.
Section 10 was agreed to.
On section 11-duration of Act:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This section
fixes the date of the expiry of the measure,
but keeps alive the power to pay any obligation incurred prior to that date.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I suppose that
if the liabilities exceeded the amount of the
appropriation, there would have to be a
re-vote.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I presume that we might, if we
so desired, engage in considerable discussion
over many of the clauses in this measure.
We probably should be justified in expressing
our own opinions, as well as some that we
have read or listened to elsewhere. Exception might be taken to one or two clauses
in the Bill, but I am not disposed to spend

any time in discussing the measure at present.
Our consent to the passage of the Bill does
not imply that we are in entire agreement
with all the details. The whole thing has
been considered in a thorough manner by the
elected representatives of the people, in whom
is vested the responsibility for public expenditures in this country. For my part, I
realize that in dealing with the relief situation the Government has a monumental
task. The problem is different from anything that we have hitherto experienced. No
government, parliament, or individual in
Canada ever had a graver duty than that
which rests upon those responsible for the
carrying on of this relief work. We all hope
that before another year rolls around the
volume of employment will have greatly
increased, and that Canadians will have
resumed their usually happy outlook.
Section 11 was agreed to.
The title and the preamble were agreed to.
The Bill was reported.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH moved the third

He said: Honourable members, before
leaving the Chamber in response to an important message, the right honourable leader

ALLEGED FLOGGINýG 0F INDIAN BOYS
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
desire to direct attention to a Canadian Press
report describing the fiogging of nineteen
Indian boys at the reservation school at
Shubenacadie in conneetion with an allcged

thef.t of $53.

According to, this report, the

principal of the school said that the bcatings
had been admînistered flot as punishment,
but to elicit information about the missing
money. Unless hie is rnisreported, his staitement makes the occurrence a great deal
worse, for apparently the boys were virtually
put through the third degree.
I arn glad to, see that the Department of
the Interior is investigating the matter. I
presumne the Department of Justice is also
interested, as a member of the Royal Cariadian Mou'nted Police was present.
I trust the inquiry will be so searching as
ta show that we recognize our duty to proteet
these heipless Wards of the nation.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I had not
heard of this report. I trust it is flot correct.
It would be the Departrnent of Indian Affairs,
flot the Interior Department, that would
conduet -the investigation. Sornetirnes we
need protection against false reports rather

SENATE
LEAGUE OF NATIONS
MOTION-DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, April
17, the adjourned debate on the motion by
Hon. Mr. McRae:
That this House is of the opinion that
Canada should withdraw from membership in
the League of Nations, and that no further
money should be voted to the League.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I note with some regret that the
bonourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) is not in his seat, as I should much
prefer that he should hear what I have to
say. If to-night I were going to undertake
to preach a sermon instead of making a few
remarks on this important question, my text
would be found in the first four words of
Matthew, 7: 15.
On March 21 the honourable senator from
Vancouver gave notice that on April 17 he
would move for Canada's withdrawal from
membership in the League of Nations. He
gave four specifie reasons for this proposal:
first, the failure of the League of Nations
to attain the object for which it was founded;
second, the present deplorable preparations
for war; third, the responsibility that may rest
on Canada to take part in future wars; fourth,
the annual payments to the League.
On April 17 the honourable senator gave us
a carefully prepared and somewhat lengthy
address on the subject of his proposals.
Among the remarks, excellent from his point
of view, contained in that address, we find
one or two that are worthy of being noticed
before the proposal is taken fully under
advisement. He said:
I wish I could arouse in the heart of every
Canadian mother with a son who is of military
age, or will beconse available for service in the
next ton years, a realization of the obligation
which, with our higli ideals, we are liable to
incur if we continue as a menber of the League
to sit at the European council table, surrounded
as it is with distrust. dislovalty. racial hatreds
and ambitions, all of whici lead to war.
With that I do not disagree. In many respects the picture is as the honourable senator
paints it. But then ie proceeds to indicate
the one way in which Canada may reach the
all to be desired object of keeping out of war
and may at the same time, I should hope,
stand with head erect, proud and unashamed.
Here is his plan:
The road is open, clear and certain, and tests
the sincerity of the nations that say they want
world peace. J refer to the total discontinuance
by all nations of the manufacture and sale
of armaments and munitions of war. Such a
policy fully enforced would end war at no
distant date.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

To me this is most arrant nonsense if we
sincerely desire to keep Canada and the
other nations of the world clear of war. I
well remember the conditions surrounding this
country in 1914, and the conditions surrounding the United States in 1915 and 1916, yes,
and in April of 1917, when that country went
into the War. As a railroad man I recall full
well the time when a four-dollar-a-day brakesman could quit his job, go over the fence
and get eight or ten dollars a day for making
munitions, and, because of the rush and hurry,
a ton per cent bonus. The honourable gentleman's proposal would simply have this result, which I am sure is desired by manyand I do net refer to the honourable senator
-the creation of many additional millionaires
by means of the opportunities that would
come to industry and to individuals in the
event of unforeseen war striking Canada or
any other nation or group of nations in the
world. Such an event would have a tendency
to speed up the equipment of factories for
manufacturing the necessary implements of
war, and if that proposal were put into effect
we should no doubt have a repetition of some
of the conditions that we had in the past.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But if all nations in
the world adoptcd that policy, how could we
have such conditions?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My ionourable
frind's suggestion is entirely right. If all
nations in the world adopted that policy the
effect would be altogether desirable. But in
the meantime is Canada, which bas such a
prend heritage, going to lie down and sulk
in the background until all the otier nations
manage to come, without the advice or
assistance of this country, to see the situation
in the same light that my honourable friends
from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) and frem
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) see it?
On March 21 the honourable senator from
Vancouver placed on the Order Paper sixteen
questions relating to the League. They are
important questions, which we all should be
able to answer, but I frankly admit that I
did net know the answer to a number of
them until I saw the return that was brought
down. During the course of his address on
the 17th of this month the honourable sonator himself answered a number of these questions, but he did not give details with respect
to them all. I think that some of these details should be stated now, in order that they
may appear on the record for future referonce. The honourable gentleman's questions
numbered 1 to 5 have to do with matters of
salary and expenses.

APRIL 24, 1934
Right Hon. 'Mr. MEIGHEN: When, were
the questions asked?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCH: On March 21. They
appeiar in the Minutes of the Proceedings of
March 22. The first five questions, with their
answers, were as follows:
1. What was the salary of the Canadian
Advisory Officer of the League of Nations and
what are the other expenses of his office for
the year 1932-33?
Salary, Canadian Advisory Officer, 1932-33,
$5,400; other expenses, 1932-33, $16,598.72.
2. What were the total expenses of Canadian
Delegates to the Assembly and all other meetings or conferences connected with the League
of Nations during the year 1932-33?
Expenses delegates, League of Nations 193233, $8,098.80; expenses delegates Disarmament
Conference, 1932-33, $11,356.14; International
Labour Conference, 1932-33, $12,005.48.
3. What contribution did Canada make for
publications issued by the League of Nations
for the year 1932-33?
Contribution for publications, 1932-33, $645.
4. What was the total sum of money Canada
expended in connection with the League of
Nations for the year 1932-33, including the
Disarmament Conference?
Total that Canada expended, 1932-33, $278,018.29.
5. What amount of money, if any, did Canada contribute te the Permanent Court of
International Justice for the year 1932-33?
Contribution to the Permanent Court of
International Justice is part of the general
contribution made to the League and consequently ne separate payment is made.
Questions numbered 6 te 16 are all interesting and important, but I will not read
them all. Question No. 8 was:
What is the basis of assessment for the
States-members of the League-to meet the
expenditures of the League, and how is it
determined?
The answer is:
The Covenant originally stipulated in Article
6, that the expenses should be borne by states
members on the basis of the Universal Postal
Union system, but experience at once proved
that this basis, which operated satisfactorily
within the limits of a very restricted budget,
was unsuitable for League purposes, and after
a series of investigations by an expert conmittee and discussions in the earlier Assemblies,
the Covenant was in 1924 amended te read as
follows:
"The expenses of the League shall be borne
by the Members of the League in the proportion decided upon by the Assembly."
The Sixth Assembly, after several years of
careful investigation, adopted an improved systemi of allocation of expenses which is still in
force. It is based on units which take into
consideration such factors as revenue, population, etc., of the various members, and which
varies according te the number of members
of the League and the amount of the budget.
The present unit is 33,016.43 gold francs. The
scale of assessment is as followu.

281

Then follow the names of the various states,
fifty-seven all told, which are members of
the League.
Question No. 12 asks for:
A list of the members and the assessment
in dollars paid by each member for the year
1932-33.

To this the answer is:
The League financial year is the calendar
year. Assessment is net in dollars but in gold
francs equivalent te 0.3225806 of a gramme of
gold, 90 per cent fine. The various dollar currencies fluctuated very considerably during this
period.
The list of members and the assessment in
francs for 1933 was as follows.
Then follows a list of the member-states,
with assessements. I will read into the record,
in alphabetical order, the names of the ten
states which put up more than a million
francs a year for the benefit of the League:
Canada.. .. .. .. .. .. .. 1155,574.93
China.. ..............
1,518,755.63
France.. ..............
2,608,297.71
Germany.. ............
2,608,297.71
Great Britain.. ........
3,466,724.80
Indià.. ..............
1,848,919.89
Italy.. ..............
1,980,985.60
Japan.. ............
1,980,985.60
Poland.. .. .. .. .. .. .. 1,056,525.65
Spain.. ............
1320,657.07
Each of the other forty-seven nations named
in the list contributes less than a million gold
francs annually for the maintenance of the
League.
Question 13 was:
What are the names of the states-members
of the League-who sent representatives te any
meeting of the League in the year 1933?
In the answer the names of fifty-ive states
are given.
The last question, No. 16, was:
Have any charges been made during the year
1933 through the contingency votes of any
department in connection with the expenses of
delegates te the various overseas conferences
and commissions and, if se, what departmnents
and the amount of money se charged te each
department?
Five items are enumerated in the answer,
with the charges in each case, the total of
charges being about $6,000.
There is in the list of questions one that I
omitted to refer to, the fourteenth:
Of the nineteen states in arrears in their
dues te the League as shown in return of
January 31, 1933,(a) Have any of these states withdrawn fromn
the League, and, if se, what ones?
(b) Have any of these states paid their
arrears, and, if se, what ones?
(c) Have any of these states while in
arrears attended and taken part in the deliberations of the League in 1933, and, if se, what
ones?

282

SENATE

The answer is:
(a) Yes. Germany has given notice of withdrawal.
(b) Australia, Greece, Lithuania, New Zealand, Persia, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
All except Honduras and the
(c) Yes.
Argentine Republic.
This is the fifteenth question:
Has any state been d'ropped from membership for non-payment of dues?
This is answered in the negative.
Honourable seantors may think some of
this information is not essential, but I submit it is, in connection with certain remarks
that I shall bave to make.
Let me ask honourable members to carry
their minds back to February 1, when the
same distinguished senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) took part in the debate
on the Address and gave to the House, and,
I hope, to the country, a great deal of muchneeded advice. In the course of his remarks
he made a statement that for the life of
me I cannot reconcile with his present proposal that Canada withdraw frnm the League
of Nations. At page 45 of Hansard I find
the honourable gentleman reported as follows:
J believe that our future is tied up with the
British Empire.
It is diflicult to imagine any other sentiment
being voiced by a statesman from the westernmost province. 1, too, believe that our future
is tied up with the British Empire, and for
that reason I cannot understand why under
present conditions it should be suggested to
us that Canada should withdraw from the
League of Nations and make no further contribution towards the maintenance of worldwide peace.
Some years ago Rudyard Kipling aroused
a gond deal of criticism when he wrote Our
Lady of the Snows. The past winter may
tend to make us a little more charitable in
our attitude towards himl However, in personifying Canada as the Lady of the Snows
he gave expression to this splendid thought:
Daughter am I in my mother's house,
But mistress in my own.
I think every red-blooded 'Canadian on reading those lines has responded, "Yes, truly,
that is so." But if the proposal presented 'by
the honourable senator from Vancouver is to
be put into effect, we shall have to add to
the couplet:
If wars, oppression, smite mother's house,
I must vote my own.
In other words, it is now proposed that
we should take no part nor parcel in maintaining peace. Not only se, but when confronted with the question of supporting the
Mother Country in time of war we are to
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

go out into the highways and byways, from
one end of Canada to the other, to find out
what red-blooded Canadians with their pride
of heritage in the Empire are going to do
about rallying to its support. This may be
the proper course to take, but still I look
back to the 8th day of August, 1914, when
I was sitting with some thirty-live or forty
associates,
sometimes called
roughnecks,
representing labour and discussing questions
that had been before us for months, questions of serious import affecting men who
were not by any means getting adequate
wages, and we were told the British Empire
was at war. What happened,? At once we
brushed aside all our claims and suggestions
in order te devote ourselves to something
vastly more important. The British Empire
was at war, and nothing else mattered. Now
another doctrine is being preached. Maybe
it is sound, but I have my doubts.
At the opening of my remarks I said that
if I were going to preach a sermon on this
important subject I should take for my text
the first four words of the 15th verse of the
7th chapter of Matthew: Beware of false
prophets. I should regard that as an allsufficient text on which to base my appeal
to the Canadian people on the question now
engaging our attention.
Again may I express regret that my honourable friend from Vancouver is not in bis
seat. However, his absence will not deter
me from saying what I intended te say while
looking across the aisle at him.
When anyone undertakes to giv e us advice, naturally we desire to know something
about bis record.
When we are going to
engage a lawyer we ascertain his standing at
the Bar and whether he will give us conscientious service. And so witth the advice
proffered us by the honourable senator from
Vancouver, we may properly go back into
the records to discover whence comes this
advice and how deserving it is of our consideration. I find that in 1929 the same distinguished gentleman while in another place
was giving advice, indeed virtually issuing
an ultimatum in tones of authority based on
experience. He made an eloquent address on
the settlement of the great Peace River
territory. No other than a person with ripe
experience and first-hand knowledge of the
facts could have delivered such a convincing
speech. No real estate salesman could have
been more enthusiastic than was the honourable gentleman in his proposals for the advantage of this country. In the light of what
has since transpired let us review those
observations and see how little worth whiie
they were.

APRIL 24, 1934
I said last year that the grub hoe and the
axe, so far as clearing land is concerned, should
be relics of the past.
Then lie referred to the statement of the honourable Minister of Immigration and Colonization of that day, that the settlement in
the West had been brought about by "people
beginning in a small way, humbly adding to
their belongings, bit by bit, until the whole
My honourable
country was transformed.''
friend after giving this quotation continued:
That was true in the old days, but holds
good no longer. It is not in the national
interest that they should make such slow
progress, even if new settlers would be content
to do so. I believe it is just as necessary for
us to conserve our man-power as our money.
This brings me to the point I want to make.
Kind heaven witnesses the hundreds of
thousands of idi1e men in this Canada of ours
at the present time. They and their dependents, if given the opportunity, would be only
too glad to use the grub hoe and the axe to
hew out a home for themselves in the wilderness. That is a sample of the honourable
gentleman's optimism at the time. But let me
quote further this ambitious, enthusiastic and
far-seeing prophet:
I proposed last year that the Government
issue land bonds against their expenditure on
such a development. I gave as the maximum
required $300,000,000 for a ten-year program,
an average of $30,000,000 per year.

Here is one further gem of advice. Still
speaking of the great Peace River territory,
lie said:
Almost to the four corners of this vast
empire the Government has permitted, yes even
encouraged, home-loving, land-hungry settlers to
locate on land which for years must remain
beyond the reach of transportation. It would
take at least twelve branch lines, aggregating
1,000 miles, to put these settlers within the
twenty miles of a railway which is to-day
considered the maximum distance from transportation for successful farming.
I hasten to add that the honourable gentleman, having spoken at great length, moved a
resolution of want of confidence in the Government of the day because it was net doing what
his optimism impelled him to suggest it
should do. I have placed these brief quotations before honourable senators so that they
may bear them in mind when weighing the
advice of the honourable gentleman from
Vancouver that Canada should withdraw from
the League of Nations.
In order te show how times have changed,
may I again refer to the honourable gentleman's speech of 'the first of February. It is a
carefully worded and well-informed address,
but entirely at variance with all the proposals
lie put forward in the years gone by. I would

283

suggest that maybe his present advice is just
as unsound as the advice he proffered the
Government in 1929. On the first day of
February lie said:
Two problems which I want to refer to at
the moment are railway deficits and the cost
of government.
And he went on to elaborate his views on
those subjects. If his advice had been taken
in 1929 one thousand miles more of railway
would have been built in the Peace River
district, and railway deficits would have been
substantially larger than they a.re at the
present moment. Then as to the cost of
government, what is the reduction that is
now proposed? It is $278,018.02 a year, or
something like that. A considerable item! It
amounts to less than three cents per oapita
for the men, women and children of Canada.
Yet we find the distinguished and honourable
gentleman, great soldier as lie was, and is,
saying no word about the $13,000,000 a year
paid out in Canada for national defence. If
there is any sincerity in the effort to reduce
the cost of government, if there is any sincerity
in the attempt to banish war from the world,
what is the necessity of our maintaining a
Department of National Defence? No one
knows better than I do that there are some
very distinguished and high-class gentlemen
attached to that department who never did a
day's work in their lives other than soldiering.
I had a note here in reference to the present
personnel of the Department of National
Defence. They have a lot of friends who
would hate to see them summarily dismissed.
Let us be reasonably consistent if we are going
to preaclh peace, and the scrapping of the
implements of war. Let us be logical and say
that we will go further and will not have in
the pay of Canada, for purposes of defence,
even a corporal's guard.
Please, honourable gentlemen, do not get
the idea that I am advocating some of the
points that I am only trying to make clear
to you. The point I do want to stress is
this: in view of the part that Canada has
played .in the past in rallying to the support
and defence of the Mother Country, she is
deserving of something better than the suggestion by an honourable gentleman that she
should welsh on the giving of a paltry three
cents per capita towards the maintenance of
peace and harmony among the nations of the
world.
I do net wish to be tiresome, honourable
gentlemen, but I would mention, for the
record, at least, some of the things that I
think sufficiently and amply warrant Canada

284

SENATE

and Canadians in carrying on as they have
been wont to do. I know, of course, that the
honourable senator from Vancouver is net
the only distinguished gentleman in Canada
who is in favour of our withdrawing from the
League of Nations. I am quite aware that
there are many others, as there are also some
high-class newspapers of the country, who hold
the same view. In my judgment they do not
represent Canada's viewpoint when they say
that we should at this late date get into the
welshing class and back out of something that
is costing us less per capita than the price
of a postage stamp.
Let us find out why the League of Nations
is the wooden gun that the distinguished
senator from Vancouver and others say it is.
You have all, I am sure, read the Treaty of
Versailles. We, in common with millions of
others Canadians, watched with anxiety the
negotiations and discussions that brought into
being the Treaty of Versailles. It may be
that at this late date we can all admit that
in 1919, by reason of personal loss and sacrifice, we were more animated by revenge and
hate than we should have been. The fact remains that proposals were adopted which, as
it bas developed in the history of the world
since that time, were impossible of execution.
One of the foremost leaders in the negotiation
of the Treaty of Versailles was that greait
statesman and citizen of the republic to the
south, Woodrow Wilson. We all remember
his fourteen points. Most of us, I think, at
that time applauded each of those points,
and possibly added to them in our own humble imagination.
What was the result of
the activities of that great statesman? Shortly
after the treaty was signed a change of government took place, and there is not one of
us on this side of the international boundary
who did not sec, in the months and years that
followed, disparaging remarks or suggestions
about the League of Nations. In consequence
of the death of Woodrow Wilson and the
defeat of the party to which he belonged,
the United States adopted a policy of handsoff, of holding aloof from any participation
in or connection with the plan which had
been enunciated, and which was signed in
Paris in the form of the Treaty of Versailles.
Thus the two greatest Anglo-Saxon nations
that the world bas ever known were separated
by reason of an altogether necessary proposal
for the creation and maintenance of world
peace.
Let us be honest with ourselves and our
fellows in this country and admit where the
real blame lies for any failure on the part of
the League of Nations to perform the funcHon. Mr. MURDOCK.

tions it was created to perform, and for the
fact that it is alluded to as a wooden gun.
There are good, logical, consistent reasons
why things have not worked out as they
might have donc.
Honourable gentlemen
know those reasons as well as, or possibly
better than I. But does this mean that we in
Canada, remembering the great sacrifice of
mon and substance, will take no further part
in holding up the lamp to light the way to
world peace, and will not raise our voices to
secure for the world the positive prohibition
of the disastrous conditions that came upon
us and upon the Empire, yos, upon the
world, between 1914 and 1918? If that is the
position that is to be taken, I do not know
my Canada; I do not know the heritage that
the British Empire has handed down to us.
I think it is most unfortunate that an honourable and distinguished member of this
Chamber, a great soldier, should have risen
in this House to propose the welshing act at
a time when there is perhaps greater need
than ever before of demonstratingDaughter an I in mn mother's liouse,
But mistress in my own.
Now lot us hasten along to ascertain and
place on record, beoause the distinguished
gentleman from Vancouver did not do it,
some of the things performed by the League
of Nations, or its departments, that may have
been at least a little worth while.
Since the inception of the League of Nations in 1919 several disputes, some of which
were of a distinctly menacing character, have
been settled through the intervention of the
League. During 1921 strained relations existed between Sweden and Finland regarding
the sovereignty of the Aland islands. An
amicable settlement was reached on the basis
proposed after two impartial commissions
appointed by the League had conducted investigations.
Since 1920 disagreement has existed between Poland and Lithuania regarding the
Vilna boundary territory, which is held by
Poland. Although this is still an unsettled
question, the several efforts made by the
League have undoubtedly resulted in preventing the development of a state of actual
warfare between these two countries.
Two European disputes, which prior to
1914 would unquestionably have resulted in
the outbreak of Balkan wars, with the resultant menace to world peace which is inevitably
involved in such a situation, have been settled
by League action. In 1925 actual fighting
took place between Grecian and Bulgarian
troops on the frontier, and an ultimatum was
issued by .Greece to Bulgaria. Troops of each

APRIL 24, 1934
country invaded the other's territories. On
the appeal of Bulgaria the League Council
took action, as a result of which a truce was
declared, fighting ceased, and troops were
withdrawn from invaded territories within
sixty hours of the League Council's instructions being received. An impartial commission appointed by the League investigated
the facts, and, acting upon the Commission's
report, the League Council succeeded in
establishing peace between the two countries.
A frontier dispute developed in 1921 between
Albania and Jugoslavia. Jugoslavian troops
invaded Albanian territory, and fighting broke
out. The dispute was settled by League intervention
During 1923424 Poland and Czechoslovakia
entered into a frontier quarrel concerning the
possession of Jaworsina. The League, with
the assistance of the Permanent Court of International Justice, submitted a solution of
the difficulty, whiéh was accepted by both
governments.
The Treaty of Versailles bequeathed to the
League of Nations the very difficult and
delicate problem of determining the disposition of Memel, which is situated on the west
frontier of Lithuania and prior to the War
was part of East Prussia. The problem was
an extraordinarily complex one, but in 1924
the Council of the League submitted a convention which bequeathed Memel to Lithuanian sovereignty-a settlement which was
adopted by the Conference of Ambassadors.
The British Governçment in 1923 referred
to the League Council a dispute which had
arisen with France respecting the authority
of France to compel British subjects resident
in, Tunis and Morocco to serve in the French
army. The attitude taken by the Freneh
Government was that it was the sovereign
right of a state to determine the nationality
of those who resided within its borders, and
that this applied to the protectorates. On
this ground the French claimed that the matter was not one which lay within the competency of outsiders to determine. The legal
aspect of the case was referred by the League
Council to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which found that the case was
not one that could be considered as being
confined within the scope of domestie jurisdiction. This judgment was agreed to by the
French Vice-Presidenît of the Permanent
Court. Following the submission of this legal
decision, a satisfactory settlement was reached
by the two governments.
In 1923 an alarming situation developed
between Italy and Greece in connection with
the murder of some Italians. An ultimatum
was issued upon Greece by Italy, and the
island of Corfu occupied by the latter coun-

285

try. Greece appealed to the League of Nations, and the Council, with the assistance of
the Conference of Ambassadors, secured the
evacuation of the, occupied island, and war
was averted.
In 1924-25 a very dangerous dispute arose
between Great Britain-as holding the mandatory authority for the control of I-raq-and
Turkey, concerning the control of the northern frontier of Iraq. Turkish troops crossed
the frontier, but through the intervention of
the League fighting was stopped and an impartial commission of enquiry appointed.
Subsequently to this action a treaty was entered into between Great Britain and Turkey,
which definitely settled the question.
In 1928 active hostilities took place between Bolivia and Paraguay. The League
Council immediately exercised its good offices,
and as a. result the frontier fighting was
arrested and the dispute was settled through
the medium of the Pan-American Union,
which was in session at Washington at the
time.
I can almost hear a number of honourable
gentlemen saying: "But all those disturbances
are over in Europe. How is Canada interested
in them?" The Great War was ostensibly
caused by an action of little Serbia in July,
1914. Nevertheless, standing on the Heights
of Quebec on the 3rd or 7th of October of
that year, I saw troop ships bearing some
33,000 Canadian soldiers in haste to the
assistance of the Motherland. Our Empire
became involved in a war started by a small
incident in Europe, with which continent some
people-who of course have a right to their
views-say we are not concerned. To me it
seems that this world has become a much
smaller place since 1914. Distances that
existed prior to that time have been almost
annihilated. I hope that those who think we
should not be concerned about any of those
disputes 'I have just referred to will not
forget the origin of the great conflagration of
1914-1918, which cost Canada so many lives
and so much of its wealth. Bear in mind,
honourable senators, that I am trying to build
up a case to justify the contribution of three
cents per capita to the furtherance and maintenance of world peace, which all countries so
sadly need.
The next matter to which I wish to refer is
the League's work in the conservation of
health, manhood and womanhood. The League
has interested itself in the promotion of
international health, and a number of principles of international health control have
been laid down. Cancer and infantile mortality have been investigated, as also have
malaria, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness, and

286

SENATE

rabies. Efforts have also been extended to
ensure the promotion of more sanitary conditions, particularly in the more backward areas
of eastern and southeastern Europe, the
Mediterranean areas, the Far East, and South
America. Non-injurious standards have also
been established for a considerable number of
drugs.
The League has set up a permanent committee whose sole mission is to investigate
the facts in connection with international
traffic in opium and habit-forming drugs. Conferences have been held in connection with
this subjeet, and a convention bas been passed
which aims at the suppression of opium consumption, and another convention which
seeks to restrict more effectively the production and manufacture of drugs and to ensure
more effective control and supervision of international trade in habit-forming drugs. The
influence of the League in the education of
public opinion regarding the disastrous results
of uncontrolled and widespread use of
narcoties bas been considerable. Since 1908,
when the Parliament of Canada passed an Act
prohibiting the selling, offering for sale,
possessing, or manufacturing of either crude
opium except for legitimate purposes, or
opium prepared for smoking, Canadian public
opinion bas been fuîlly alive to the national
menace which such traffic imposes. It is
interesting to note that not only were Canadian opium factories, whieh in 1907 were producing 3600,000 worth of opium. closed, but
imports of opium dropped from 88,000 pounds
per annum in 1908 to 1,012 pounds in 1930.
Nevertheless the illicit traffic in narcotics, including opium, morphine, heroin, and cocaine,
has necessitated and still necessitates the constant vigilance of Canadian authorities. The
action of the League of Nations in attempting, with some success, to limit and more
stringently regulate traffic in habit-forming
drugs has been of considerable value to
Canada. As pointed out by Mr. C. H. L.
Sharman, Chief of the Narcotics Division of
our own Department of Pensions and National
Health, it is interesting to note that:
During the year ended June 30. 1931, three
and one-half tons of illicit narcotic drugs were
seized in the United States. This quantity
represents nearly fifty million grains, and as
the almost invariable price paid by the
eventual. illicit consumer, exclusive of adulteratien, which is usually from thirtv to fifty per
cent, is one dollar per grain, the amount of
money devoted to the purchase of these deadly
drugs in the United States in one year was
nearly $50,000,000.
This immense value, be it noted, covers only
drugs that were seized by the authorities.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Too little is generally known of the wholesome and enormous influence wielded by the
League of Nations in its bearing upon the
settlement of the numerous issues which arose
in connection with the carrying out of the
international problems arising out of the
Treaty of Peace, and it can safely be stated
that had it net been for the League or some
other organization of a similar character, less
happy settlements of these various issues would
have been reached.
The instances I have cited are only examples of some of the actual results achieved
by the League on these important questions.
After I knew that I was going to speak
on this question, I thought I should get some
up-to-date information on the drug question
from Mr. C. H. L. Sharman, Chief of the
Narcotic Division of the Department of
Pensions and National Health. I wrote him
on the 9th of April and he replied on the
12th. I want to place on the record the whole
of his letter with the exception of the first
paragraph. He says:
In reply may I state that the work conducted in Canada in connection w ith both
the legal and illegal use of narcotics presents
se many angles that it would be difficult indeed
to give a concise picture thereof within the
confines of one communication. J am therefore attaching a copy of the 1931 annual report, which is tic most coiprehensive of those
published in recent years, and which. in fact,
was circulated by the League of Nations to
the other countries of the world as indicative
of the Canadian method of narcotic control.
Perhaps a good indication of the measure of
control of the legal traffie which has been
maintained are the figures shown on page 4
of the annual report, whici show that it bas
been possible to reduce the legal importation
of narcotics into Canada in 1930 as compared
with 1920, to the following extent:
1920
1930
Cocaine .. .. ..
6,968 ounces 2,011 ounces
and
Morphine
Heroin. .. .. 28,198 ounces 6,861 ounces
Crude Opium.. . 13,626 pounds 1,012 pounds
These reductions have been maintained since
1930 and the quantities involved are still sufficient for the legitimate medical needs of the
country. I also enclose a copy of the honourable Minister's report for 1933, on pages 70-76
of which will be found the latest statistics
available.
Dealing with the co-ordination of the narcotie work in Canada, both as it affects legal
and illegal traffic, with the rest of the civilized
world through the medium of the League of
Nations, it is, of course obvious that it is
entirely within Canada's competence, irrespective of international obligations, to pass such
narcotic legislation as now exists, but, in fact,
the value of such legislation in Canada. in so
far as the results accruing from its effective
administration are concerned, would be much
less effective were it not for the fact that
most of the provisions of our Canadian legis-

APRIL 24, 1934
lation are based upon international conventions, to which the majority of the countries
of the world conform, which conventions have
been arrived at as a result of conferences held
at Geneva under the auspices of the League of
For example, no narcotics under
Nations.
Canadian legislation can enter or leave Canada
without a special permit, but this provision is
immeasurably strengthened by the fact that
under the international obligations, no other
country can issue an export licence for narcotics to leave their shores until they have
in their possession the actual import licence
from the country for which the shipment is
intended. In that way, neither Canada nor
any other country can have narcotics exported
to it unless and until she has previously intimated her concurrence.
The first of these international conventions
arrived at through the auspices of the League
of Nations became internationally effective in
1928, and, as a result of the general experience of the nations of the world in administering same, it became evident that world opinion
was ripe for further progress. Consequently
in 1931 a further conference was held at
Geneva attended by 57 nations, as a result of
which a convention was arrived at, which was
a very marked step forward in limiting the
manufacture and regulating the distribution of
narcotic drugs. This convention became internationally effective on January 1, 1934.
Canada to-day, in common with the other
nations of the world, supplies quarterly to
Geneva full details of all ber narcotic imports
and exports, which are closely scrutinized by
a League of Nations clearing-house, called the
Permanent Central Opium Board, and any discrepancies between reports of imports and
exports between the countries concerned are
closely followed up. In addition, each country
has to supply the League of Nations in advance
with detailed estimates of her narcotic requirements for the ensuing calendar year. The
details in regard thereto are very intricate and
I would not burden you with them, but the
estimates received from every nation are carefully scrutinized and co-ordinated at Geneva,
and steps taken to ensure that world manufacture is limited to the actual legitimate needs
of all the countries of the world.
Similarly, there is at Geneva an Opium
Advisory Committee, consisting of the representatives of 25 nations, of which Canada is
one. This committee meets twice yearly and
besides engaging in a minute scrutiny of existing world conditions as regards legal control
of, and illicit traffic in, narcotics, initiates
action on a large number of matters which have
a direct relation thereto. For example, for
the next meeting at Geneva there are 26 subjects for discussion and action ranging from
consideration of yearly reports from all countries to efforts being made to obtain universal
extradition in connection with narcotie offences,
the special situation existing in certain countries, and the economic and financial losses
sustained as a result of drug addiction.
Canada makes no secret of the fact that
narcotic addiction exists within her bordera.
The Canadian Narcotic Act is an excellent
piece of legislation looked upon by many as
having no superior in the world. With the
co-operation of the R.C.M. Police and other
police forces in Canada, the situation is kept
well under control, but the governing factor
is that without the co-operation of other

287

countries, such co-operation being co-ordinated
through the League of Nations, the exercise of
such control would be a much more difficult
matter and one which would involve considerably heavier expenditure.
Yours very truly,
C. H. L. Sharman,
Chief, Narcotic Division.
I ask every Canadian who has any sense of
respcnsibility for the health and prestige of
Canada, whether what the League is doing for
the suppression of the drug traffic is not alone
worth the contribution of three cents per
capita.
I now want to deal with another worthwhile organization of the League of Nations,
the Permanent Court of International Justice.
Not being a lawyer, I should possibly be
handicapped if I attempted a lengthy discussion of this body, and therefore my reference to it will be brief. I have one or two
observations to make which I think will
indicate that it was probably unfortunate for
Canada that no such institution as the World
Court was in existence many years ago.
This court is composed of nineteen judges
of the highest international reputation, who
are appointed by the Council and Assembly
of the League of Nations. Many decisions
and opinions have been given by the court on
matters of international law in connection with
disputes concerning which grave international
complications might very easily have developed prior to 1914. Judgments have been
rendered in connection with disputes which
have developed involving the Allied Powers
and Germany, Great Britain and Greece,
Greece and Bulgaria, Germany and Poland,
France and Turkey, France and Switzerland,
and other countries. Distinct contributions
have been made, to the maintenance of inter.national peace through the adjudications of
this court.
With my very limited knowledge of legal
questions and of this court, when I was reading that paragraph I tried to visualize some
conditions that existed in Canada a good
many years ago. Honourable members of this
House who come from the Maritime Provinces, and who perhaps occasionally travel here
via Saint John, McAdam and Megantic, have,
I am sure, often been struck by the fact that
on the way they pass over more than two
hundred miles of United States territory which
is like an elbow stuck into the aide of Canada
and stretches to within about forty miles of
the Saint Lawrence river. In my humble
judgment, a Permanent World Court of Justice
in years gone by might have prevented that
unreasonable interjection of a piece of foreign

288

SENATE

country into what Canadians logically regard
as their own territory.
I pass on now to another function of the
League, which I am sure all honourable members will pardon me for referring to as one of
the most important, if not the most important,
of its activities.
I desire to place on Hansard Part XIII
of the Treaty of Versailles, being section 1,
on the Organization of Labour. It reads:
Whereas the League of Nations bas for its
object the establishment of universal peace, and
such a peace ean be establislhed only if it is
based upon social justice;
And whereas conditions of labour exist
involving such injustice, hardship and privation to large numbers of people as to produce
unrest so great that the peace and harmony
of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those conditions is urgently required:
as, for example, by the regulation of the hours
of work, includ'ing the establishment of a
maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of
unemployment, the provision of an adequate
living wage, the protection of the worker
against sickness, disease and injury arising out
of his employment, the protection of children,
young persons and women, provision for old age
and injury, protection of the interests of
workers when emoployed in countries other than
their own, recognition of the principle of
freedom of association. the organization of
vocational and technical education and other
tneasures;
Whereas also the failure of any nation to
adopt humane conditions of labour is an
obstacle in the way of other nations which
desire to improve the conditions in their own
countries;
The High Contracting Parties, moved by
sentiments of justice and humanity, as well as
by the desire to secure the permanent peace
of the w torld,
agree to the following.
I hope every honourable gentleman will be
sufficiently interested to read the remainder
of Part XIII.
It is only fair to say that the International
Labour Office bas functioned more effectively
than any other of the League's branches.
Certain it is thtat the International Labour
Organization bas discussed and passed many
worth-while conventions, all directed towards
the goal set forth in what I have just quoted.
I shall now enumerate briefly some of the
accomplishments of the International Labour
Office. Since the institution of the International Labour Office in 1919 forty conventions and forty-two recommendations have
been adopted by the various conferences, and
some five hundred and sixty-six ratifications
of conventions have been recorded. In other
words, five hundred and sixty-six labour
treaties have been brought into being. The
subjects covered by these conventions include
hours of work in industry; protection of
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

women before and after child-birth; prohibition of night work in the bakeries; em.ployment of women on night work; minimum age
of employment in industry; prohibition of
white lead in paint; workmen's compensation
for diseases; minimum age of employment at
sea; medical examination of young sailors;
employment agencies for seamen; unemployment indemnity in case of shipwreck; weekly
rest in industry, etc.
The following conventions have
been
definitely ratified by Canada: minimum
age (sea), unemployment indemnity (shipwreck), minimum age (trimmers and stokers).
medical examination of young persons (sea),
the use of white phosphorus-though legislation covering this matter had been passed in
Canada prior te the adoption of the convention.
The following is the standing of Canada
with regard to other conventions adopted by
the International Labour Office: legislative
action, which applies conventions in part;
hours of work in industry, unemployment,
child-birth, niglt work for women, minimum
age in industry, nigbt work for young persons
in industry, employment for seamen, minimum
age in agriculture, workmen's compensation in
agriculture, weekly rest in industry, workmen's
accident
compensation, workmen's disease
compensation, equality of treatment in accirient cases, inspection of emigrants on board
ship. minimum wage-fixing machinery, dockers'
protection against accident.
Conventions in connection with which
legislation bas been enacted in Canada, but
no formal ratification given: rigbts of association in agricultural industry, seamen's articles
of agreement, repatriation of seamen, weigit
of packages transported by vessels, forced or
compulsory labour.
Honourable members are aware that by
reason of the provinces having jurisdiction
aver property and civil riglts several of these
conventions could not be adopted by the
Federal Government; but nearly all have
been put inte effect by some of the provinces.
Undoubtedly Canada by her voice and er
vote has helped te improve labour conditions
throughout the world. Is not that of itself
worth three cents per capita to our citizens?
What is wrong with the League of Nations
and the International Labour Office?
Only
too often the representatives of the membernations are actuated by self-centered, selfserving motives. I never think of the International Labour Office without recalling a
conference which I attended as the representative of the Government of Canada.

APRIL 24, 1934
General labour conditions ini this and other
countries were being discussed.
A distinguished and influential citizen of one of the
member-nations rose to bis feet and in
eloquent termis described the very favourable
labour conditions in his country. I suspected
he was indulging in the rankest kind of misrepresentation. What was the aftermath? He
attained a position of the greatest prominence,
but bie and bis associates so flagrantly abused
their power that at last the working men,
reduced to the degraded condition of peonage
and driven to desperation, resorted to armed
revolution and forced bim and bis goverfiment to seek an asylum in a foreign country.
This incident gives one an insight into what
is wrong with the League of Nations and the
International Labour Office.
Such self-centered, self-seeking. lying individuals. by acting
in utter disregard of the rights of humanity
and the welfare of the world, are doing an
incalculable injury to the League.'
If the
representatives of the variouis member-nations
had honestly worked for the principles underlying the formation of the League, principles
so essential to the welfare of the world, the
honourable senator fromn Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. MeRca) migbt have bad a different
story te tell. I trust no bonourable senator
will misunderstand me. I am nlot suggesting
for a moment that ail tbose who participate
in the League conferences are disregardful of
the welfare of the worid. But why have certain of the great powers given notice of withdrawal from membership in the League?
Simply because they could not have their
own way, because they could not dictate to
the rest of the world. In a word, they were
seif-seeking and self-centered.
There is ne
other legitimate or logical reason for their
intended withdrawai. Under these conditions
is this Canada of ours to faiT in lier duty to
the world? Wiil she discontinue paying bier
tbree-cents-per-capita share, and refuse to
associate bersaîf with the rest of the British
Empire in the maintenance of peace?
Now, bonourable members. I shaîl tax your
patience but a little longer while I direct your
attention to the viewpoints of two or tbree
other Canadians on this important question.
Lieutenant-Colonel George A. Drew, Comnmissioner of tbe Ontario Securities Commission, speaking at Toronto on January 28, 1934,
on "Why should Canadians be interested in
Worid Peace?" said, li part:
Although war clouds gather menacingly in
Europe and Asia there is a tendency in Canada
to think of war and .the threat of war as sounethin se remote from our daily life that we
woufd be mue h better advised to give our
undivided attention ta the solution of pressing
internai problems than to devote any part of
our energy to the problem of world peace.

We are a peaceful people. We have no
enemies. We have a friendly neighbour on
our only land boundary and two wide oceans
on the east and west. Why should we bie
concerned with the thought of war?
This
question can be answered by another. Were
wve not just as safe geographically, were we not
just as peace-loving in the spring of 1914?
We had less reason to think of war than we
have to-day, yet suddenly in August of 1914,
we were committed to a struggle wbich strained
our physical, financial and productive energy to
the very limait of endurance.
No one in Canada even visualized warfare
on such a colossal scale. In the South African
War a f ew years before about seven thousand
Canadians served with the British forces.
Although it n'as our greatest nîilitary effort
tep to that time outside of Canada. it cost us
little in men or money. But in 1914 we found
ourselves engaged in a very different type of
war.
More than six bundred thousand Canadians
enlisted for active service, of whom sixty
thousand were killed and one hundred and fifty
thousand were wounded. We spent vast sua
of money. In 1914 our national deht was
$544,O00,000. In 1920, after demobilization bad
heen completed it had jumped to $3,041,000,000,
the increase of $2,497,000,000 being almost
entirely due to our war efforts. It has heen
estimated by the Dominion Statistician that the
direct and indirect cost of the war to Canada
was more than five billion dollars.
But even more severe than this staggering
coat in men and money bas been the effect on
our social and economic life.
Maniy of the wounded were wholly or partly
incapable of returning to work. They have
received some compensation.
In 1932, 95,186
pensioners received $41,858,000. In 1934, the
amount paid for pensions will ha in the neigbbourhood of $50,000,O00.
Even this large
expenditure however does meot begin to coinpensate for the suffering and reduced earninr,
eapacity of men wbo went to w-ar in the fuli'
vigor of youth. But they are in many ways7
more fortunate than a still larger number
wbose bodies were not scarred, but whoseenergies were exhausted and spirits brokent
under the nerve-shattering strain of incessant
sheîl-fire. These men gave the hest of their
youth, and, aged far beyond their years, bave
found it increasingly difflcult to adjust themsalves to the accelerated tempo of industrial
mass production methods which have davelopect
in the past few yaars. Thase men are not
shirkars. Tbay are hurnt out physically and
spiritually and their problamn bas flot yet bean
solved. But more serious than the pligbt of
these men themselves is the effact on the minds
of their childran, who are being reared in an
atmosphere of increasing bopelessness. These
intangible consequances must be remembered in
cemputing the ceat of war.
The economie collapse which brought low
wages, unemployment, and resulting social
agitation were ail the direct resuit of the
unbalanced condition of warld trade and world
production forced by the unnatural demanda of
war.,
With ail these object lessons of what war
has meant and may mean ta Canada surely we
can offer sometbing more than innocuons
professions of belief in peace.
There are only tbree ways of attempting te
assure peace.
One is to refuse te fight.

Armenia tried the passive method against
Turkey without much success. Millions of dead
and hundreds of billions of money were lost in
proving the second method to be a ghastly
failure. The time lias come to give the third
method an honest trial before it is too late.
Collective action to enforce peace may call for
the use of economie sanctions. It is not likely
that more would be needed. But even if force
should be required, surely it is botter te take
our share in such a collective effort than to
accept the only alternative of waiting until the
balance of competing forces can no longer be
maintained and then face another world war.
Even if we should be fortunate enough te
remain neutral, we would share the resulting
economic distress.

Britishi Navy will maintain our trade routes,
thon it seeis

that we cannot escape the re-

sponsibility that we assume in depending upon
tiat protection, and should frankly say that
in retuîrn for that security we will without
question support Great Britain in the event
of war.
Surely all these considerations emuphasize
the fact that quite apart froin the moral aspect,
the whole purpose of our foreign policy must
be the maintenance of peace. We have no
iysterious source of wealth that is nîot largely
dependent upon stable foreign markets. We
have no need to wait for war to be assured
of its effect on those markets. Already we are
suffering severely because of the fear of war
in Europe. In 1930, we exported $215,000,000
worth of wheat. In 1932, this had dropped to
$115,000,000.
Lot us not be misled. The only alternative
to the enforcement of international equity by
collective action has been tried and bas proved
a ghastly failure. Unless comnion sense prevails, that failure will be repeated. The world
is armed as it never was before in time of
peace and the miad effort to obtain security by
increasing armaments which we are witnessing
to-day can only lead to destruction. Security
is what all nations want and security can only
be assured when the same principle is applied
to nations as to individuals and society at
large enforces its will upon the lawbreaker.
If this principle is once accepted, we need
not be concerned with finding an answer to
the difficult question of what and how great
our part would be in a war involving the
British Empire.
Von. Mr. MURDOCK.

Now let me read a cable message received
from Viscount Cecil of Chelwood on January 15, 1934:
I am deeply interested in the very striking
proposal for promoting study of peace and its
Situation though anxious is in
maintenance.
sonie respects encouraging. In particular attacks
on collective systeni have brought great response
from the people desiring peace. Believe that
only by collective systemi can peace be secured.
Warmest wishes therefore for success of efforts

are greatly encouraging to our work on this
side.
Cecil.
It would now appear to be appropriate to
read the views expressed in 1934 by that
great Canadian, Sir Robert Borden, who represented Canadia in preparing and signing the
Treaty of Versailles, to see in what measure,
if any, they have changed during the intervening years. On January 21, 1934, he said,
in part:
There are those who, during the past twelve
nonths, have poured scorn upon the League of
Nations and upon its alleged failures in recent
years. I rejoice that from first to last I have
given to the League my warrn support; and I
challenge contradiction when I aflirm that if
the League should disappear to-morrow, the
world would still he truly its debtor for
influence and service, impressive and enduring.
In its purpose the League vindicates
humanity's highest ideals. If in achievement it
bas failed of the great results anticipated
when we believed that war had been for ever
banished, the default is of the human elements
that constitute its fabric. In so far as the
League bas failed, humanity bas failed.
What would the scorners substitute for the
League? Slall we resign ourselves in despair
to a system of armed camps; to intensive coipetition in armaments; to another suicidal war
of unimaginable horror and destruction? What
a strange madness bas seized upon mankind if
this is to he the outcome? How shall we regard
the place of man in Nature? In knowledge,
science, invention, he bas attained amazing, unimagined heights. Shall not his spirit rise
above the beast?
The living stand before the insistent challenge
of a terrible menace that bids then gird theniselves for the cause of peace. Yet renember
that humanity, like cadi of lier nations, consists
net of the living alone, but also of those who
have passed on and of those still to be born.
Myriad voices call to us from those who died in
the Great War te end all war. In the spirit
may we not hear, beyond the veil, the cry of
generations yet to b born?
Do yen net
Let this be my final word.
believe that war's curse can be banned and
by human purpose and endeavour?
banished
Who then is responsible for world peace? I
answer. each one of us within the measure of
our influence and our effort. Upon every one
within sound of my voice rests an individual
responsibility for peace, a responsibility certain
and inescapable as death itself. Pray ponder
this. It is truth and reality, net vain idealism.
In what measure will Canada be powerful for
peace in the councils of the nations? In such
measure only as her people shall determine.

APRIL 24, 1934
Each individual unit of opinion does truly make
part of that determination and of the collective
force that measures the nation's power. God
grant that in this our duty we do not f ail.
And now we have an expression of the considered judgment of a distinguished son of
that great Canadian partner-race which,
adjacent to the shores of the mighty Saint
Lawrence, has given to the world a concrete
object lesson in the creation and maintenance
of happy, peaceful homes. I refer to the
Honourable Ernest Lapointe, President of the
League of Nations Society in Canada, who,
on January 21, 1934, spoke in part as follows:
The situation is indeed a serious one. There
are deep shadows in front of the world, which
is full of explosive material. Disruptive forces
are trying to bring about international conflicts. National hatreds, bitter controversies and
actual hostilities are to be found in many
places.
The prevailing mood is one of pessimism,
international suspicion and fear.
Sir Arthur Currie, in his last message to his
war comrades, on Remembrance Day, said to
them:-

"We know from experience the stupidity of
war and the stupidity of those who made or
caused war." And he added: "Are we fighting
so that the next generation of youth will not
condemn our stupidity as .we condemned in the
trenches the stupidity of our elders in 1914 and
the era immediately before it?"
This question of Sir Arthur Currie's may be
asked of every Canadian.
We older people are not those most interested.
If there is another war, we shall not go to it.
But youth.is most vitally concerned about this
problem of war. They may have imagined a
warfare in which courage would count, but
modern war is not that kind. The real enemy
is not human. It is not a war between men
and men. It is a war between machines and
machines, between products of science and
chemistry, and men are nerely the material for
the process of destruction.
I fail to understand the mentality of those
who still believe that differences between
countries should be decided in favour of the
strongest by the process of killing men, of
destroying towns, industries, fertile fields and of
demolishing monuments and works of art. That
this should be done in the name of freedom and
safety is a cruel paradox. ...
In common with the rest of the world, we
have signed an agreement renouncing war as
an instrument of national policy and pledging
recourse to pacific means of settling international difficulties. This is a fundamental fact
and public opinion in all countries must insist
that governments every-where keep their plighted
word and refrain not only from war but from
preparations for war. The Leagne of Nations
Society in Canada will devote itself ta this work.
Canada has much at stake in the maintenance
of peace. We are proud to believe that it has
a glorious future and will become one of the
great countries of the world. Only war can
block its way, and war can come only from
international conflicts for which we shall not
be responsible. No country stands to lose more
as a result of war and international upheavals.

The service of peace requires intelligence and
organization. It requires a new philosophy and
courage. We want to equip our association for
intelligent and vigorous participation in the
task of creating public opinion in behalf of
international co-operation. Peace is the road
that leads to salvation, and one of the paramount duties of good citizenship in this threatening hour is to keep alive the flame of hope
and courage in our hearts. The League of
Nations Society in Canada dedires to create
this spirit within every corner of our country.
The will to peace must be expressed in terms
of organization. ...
There has never been and there will never
be a war which will end war. War cannot
be ended by war. War can be ended only by
the combined will of the peoples to make it
impossible.
The creation of the League of
Nations was the embodiment of that will. The
organization of the world on a basis of peace
is indispensable. ...
Critics look only at negative results; they
refuse or are unable to see positive achievements. Wars have been averted. Even if only
one war was avoided, even if only a few human
lives were saved through the influence of the
League, it would have justified its existence
and the expenditure i involves.
Even if the League failed in one or two
instances, was it not sosmething to be able to
express the world's condemnation and even to
propose a mode of agreement?
The League stands as the outward symbol of
union among nations. It is a method of doing
business, of consultation, of getting together.
It stands as an obstacle between peoples and
war.
The real trouble lies not in the League itself,
but in the spirit which animates its menbers
and in the character of world soeiety. What
we must do is to work for the acceptance and
triumsphs of the principles on which alone a
genuine League can be based. In the last
analysis, the greatest hope and the greatest
responsibility rest with public opinion, with
tie common people of all countries. Let their
voices be heard, loud, powerful and determined.
I may be an optimist, but I believe that the
vorld will move forward, not backwards, and
that moral forces will join together in mutual
understanding and that respect for others, love
of justice and the determination to do what is
right will govern human relations.
The success of the League depends on the
development in each country of strong movements which will support the ideal of international co-operation. Public opinion can be
stimulated to a large extent by the great
organizations which exert a profound and extensive influence upon all sorts and conditions
of men and women, organizations educational,
philanthropic, social, political and religious.
I arn not trying to effect an emotional or
sentimental reaction. I appeal to the reason
and conscience of the Canadian people.
Having in view the crushing burden of taxation which the peoples are carrying, the unprecedented industrial depression and social
unrest, and even more, the demonstrated folly
of competitive armanents, which instead of
affording security are endangering it, I appeal
to my Canadian fellow-citizens to assume a
clear, unhesitant and leading position, to use
their might and strength to insure greater cooperation, a greater certainty of peace and a
more contented and happier world.

SENATE

Honourable gentlemen, I am sorry that
already I have tired a number of the honourable members of this Chamber. When,
on March 21, the honourable senator from
Vancouver started this discussion, my first
thought was-of course, improperly-that it
was just an advertising stunt, something
done just for the purpose of being different.
Then I realized that this could not be so,
and that there were real sincerity and intent
behind the proposal; and on April 17 I
realized it to an even greater degree when
I heard the speech which the honourable
senator made on that occasion. I then proceeded to delve into past prophecies and proposals. I satisfied myself that this was just
something new to be followed for a while.
I should not be at all surprised to find a
year from now the honourable senator from
Vancouver most enthusiastically supporting
an entirely contrary proposal.
As I have already said a couple of times
to-night, I am sorry the honourable senator
is not here, because I think he is among those
Canadians, numbering about ten per cent of
our population, who, with similar persons
throughout the world, are responsible for
wars and rumours of wars. Nothing more
truc was ever uttered in this world than the
25th verse of the 18th chapter of Luke, wherc
it is said:
For it is easier for a camel to go through
a needie's eye. than for a richi man to eniter
into the Kingdoml of God.

Even if I am alone in my viewpoint I am
entitled to it, and I hold hore and now that
the capitalist and the capitalistic institutions
of this and the other countries of the world
are alone responsible for the wars that have
taken place heretofore; and that if another
war comes it will be largely, if not entirely,
the result of either their activity or their inactivity in this matter. Oh, yes, I know there
will be marked disagreement with that view.
But if the rich men of the earth are peaceloving and have a regard for humanity they
can prevent war. There is not an intelligent
man in Canada, either inside this building or
out of it, who does not realize the truth of
what I Say.
To the distinguished and honourable senator
from Vancouver I commend these thoughts.
I would also remind him of the travesties
that we have seen and heard of during the
past few years. It is only two or three years
since,, in this capital city of the Dominion,
within the very shadow of these great Patliament Buildings, the police ordered sixty-eight
hungry, homeless men away from the dump,
the scrap heap where they had erected tin
shelters to protect themselves from the
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK,

elements. They were told to keep outside the
city limits. Shortly thereafter a coroner's jury
found that a Canadian boy, born at Gananoque, who had been too proud to beg in
this Canada of ours, with its teeming thousands
of bushels of wheat and other kinds of good
food, starved to death. He died of starvation
in the capital city of the Dominion. Who is
to blame? Some other gentlemen, no whit
better from the standpoint of God and
humanity, can go for a holiday to Atlantic
City or to Florida, acquire a glowing tan on
their foreheads, and come ba.ck parading their
wealth, while thousands of their fellow
Canadians are hungry and starving. That is
part of the conditions that have crcated war
in the past and will bo responsible for another
war if there is one. It is just as well that
these tihings should be said. And I think I
am fair in saying there are some Canadians
who would almost like to sec another war.
It might add to their millions; it might convert sone of their stocks in obsolete or outof-date industrial concerns into worth-while
and dividend-paying securities. Let us place
the responsibility for the war scare and the
war talk-and I minimize it not one whitwhere it properly belongs, and that is on
the kind of person referred to in the 25th
verse of the 18th chapter of Saint Luke. Fewer
than ten per cent of the people of the world
have for ages had dominion over the destinies
of the rest of the people, and that situation
still exists.
In conclusion may I say that I never for
one moment thought that this Senate, composed as it is of distinguished and capable
citizens, would say to the people of Canada,
"We are wiliing to continue a tax of $1.25
per capita for the maintenance of national
defence, but we decline to permit the per
capita expenditure of three cents, the value
of a mere postage stamp, as Canada's contribution to upholding the banners of peace
and to co-operating with the British Empire
and other nations so that in some conclusive
way war may be made for ever impossible."
On motion of Hon. Mr. Griesbach, the debate was adjourned.

CONCURRENCE IN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved concurrence in the
amendments made by the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce ta Bill F, an Act
ta amend the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Adt, 1932.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN : 1 have an
amendment, but 1 think the proper place ta
move it is on the motion for third reading.
It is not important-indeed, it is almost as
insignificant as an amendment can possibly
be--having ta do only with a clerical matter.
Hon. Mr. F0STER: Will the right honour'
able gentleman state whether it is the intention ta refer this Bill ta the Committee of the
Whole?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It wili be
gene'rally realized, of course, that the Committee of the Whole cannot be expected ta
deal with this measure as camnpetently as did
the select committee which had the Bill be-

fore it over a period of seven weeks, at almost
daily sittings that ran into hours, and which
heard the evidence adduced and arguments
pro and con. However, if it is desired ta have
the Bill referred ta Committee of the Wbole,
and certainiy if any honaurable member bas
a special suggestion ta make, the measure
shouid go there.
Hon. Mr. POSTER: I wish to make a

amendment ta wbich I bave referred, and if
any other banourable member wisbes ta move
the adjournment of the debate it wili be
perfectly agreeable.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, I move that the Bill be not read a
third time, but be amended- as follows:
Page 2, line 3. Insert immediately after
clause 2 the fallowing as new clause "B."
Subseetion two of section three of the said
Act is repealed and the following substituted
therefor(2) The provisions of Part II, other than
tbe provisions of section five, shaîl also apply
ta every company incorporated by a special
Act of the said Parliament on or before the
said date, but not licensed by the Minister on
or before the said date, and in any respect in
which the provisions of said Part II are inconsistent with the provisions of the special Act
50 passed on or before the said date, the provisions of Part II shahl prevail.
The only change is in the first line of the
subsection, where the words "the provisions"~
are substituted for the word "those." Therefore it is oniy a clerical change.
The amendment was agreed to.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Faster, the debate
was adjourned.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
This Bill
has stood so long on the Order Paper that
it is probably tired. But because of a circumstance which arose to-day I have undertaken
that it shall not be withdrawn for a short
period of time.
Certain provinces had
objected to the measure and it was not
considered important enough to be proceeded
with against their objection, but special
reasons have developed which may make
it worth while to move the second reading
later, though I cannot be certain of that.

THE TOURIST TRADE
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. W. H. DENNIS rose in accordance
with the following notice:
Tiat he will call the attention of the Senate
to the immense possibilities of the tourist trade,
and inquire if it is possible for the Government
to secure the co-operation of the provincial
authorities and transportation interests towards
its greater development.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
address this Chamber I accept the opportunity
to express my appreciation of the friendliness
with which I have been reccived by the members of this House.
It is not my intention to take up any considerable part of the time of honourable
members, but I do feel that the subjectmatter of this inquiry is so important that
it calls for careful examination. It is my hope
that through this discussion we may arrive at
a better understanding of what the tourist
trade means to Canada, and what may be
done to develop it to a much greater extent.
The value of the tourist trade to this country is written into the official records, and one
does not need to go beyond the records of
Parliament for illustrations. Let us take 1929
as the peak year of the business in this
country. In 1929 expenditures in Canada of
tourists from other countries amounted to
$309,379,000. In the same year the net value
of production in the Canadian forest industry
was $337,649,000, in the Canadian fisheries
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN

$53,518,000, in mining $310,850,000, in electrical
power $122,883,000, and in the great construction industry $386,709,000.
Canada's 1934 wheat export quota of 200,000,000 bushels would, at 65c. a bushel, bring
in $130,000,000-somewhat less than onehalf of the value of the Canadian tourist
business in its greatest year.
In other words, expenditures in Canada
by tourists from other countries in that year
were approximately six times as great as the
net value of fisheries production in Canada,
almost equal to the net value of production
in the Canadian forest, mining and construction industries, and two and one-half times as
great as the net value of production in electrical power.
As another example of the value of the
tourist trade, these comparisons are striking.
The net value of industrial production in my
own province of Nova Sceotia in 1929 was
$129,380,194, while the amount of money spent
in Canada by tourists from other countries
in that same year was $309,379,000. Since
1929, the value of the tourist industry bas
steadily declined, as indeed bas the value of
business generally throughout the world. However, the figures I have quoted for that year
are an indication of the possibilities of future
development in tourist travel in Canada.
The value of :this great trade is well recognized in the country te the south.
The
Chamber of Commerce of the United States
bas recently issued a report which shows that
the tourist industry of that country is equal
to its gigantic iron and steel industry; bas a
total value 6 per cent greater than that of
lumber production, 11 per cent greater than
production in the meat-packing industry, 11
per cent greater than in the clothing industry,
41 per cent greater than in the printing and
publishing business, 51 per cent greater than
in oil production, 185 per cent greater than in
the bakery business, and 222 per cent greater
than in the shoe business.
In considering the development of the Canadian tourist business we must take account of
the extent and efficiency of our transportation
systems, which for purposes of this trade embrace highways, railways, steamships and
airways. It is only through the fullest possible
co-operation with all branches of transportation that the Canadian tourist business can
be brought to maximum development.
Canada to-day bas a system of highways
that bas been built up at vast public expense
and is highly creditable to a country of such
immense distances and such a comparatively
small population. These highways represent
a heavy public investment, and they should

APRIL 25, 1934
be used to the fullest extent in the interest
of the country and its people. Since the
majority of visitors to Canada come by the
highways, it is essential that every possible
attention be given to the care of our roads,
the elimination of dust, and hard-surfacing
where economically feasible.
There are, I am convinced, great possibilities
in steamship tourist travel, both in our coastal
waters and through our inland waterways.
As is truc of the highways, the railways of
Canada represent a public investment of great
magnitude, and it is only through promoting
the use of these systems that a return from
the investment in them can be -realized.
While aerial transportation is still in its
infancy, it is expanding rapidly, and this mode
of travel cannot be overlooked as a contributor to a greater volume of tourist trade.
Heretofore, we in this country have given
our attention almost exclusively to the development of tourist travel to and through
Canada by people from other countries.
Surely we are overlooking great possibilities
within our own borders. In one season Canadian tourists spent more than $120,000,000, a
considerable portion of which money it certainly should be possible to keep within
Canada. I have here a letter from a
prominent transportation official stating that
on a special train that runs between Montreal
and Maine during the tourist season there has
been for the last five years an annual average
of 3,115 persons from Quebec and Ontario.
While I am not here to urge the attractions
of one part of Canada against any other, we
all know our own territory best. In my own
provinces of the Maritimes we can offer to
visitors something they will not find anywhere
else. A visit to Prince Edward Island, along
the Saint John River in New Brunswick, or
the coast line of that province, or to almost
any part of Nova Scotia, reveals something
long to be remembered by people in search of
recreation.
In the Maritimes we have good roads and
are well served by railway and steamship
lines. We also have facilities for people who
favour aerial transportation.
Another great asset in relation to tourist
business is the radio. Now that Canada is
developing an extensive and efficient network
of broadcasting stations, these facilities should
be used to a much greater extent in broadcasting the attractions of the Dominion in
this regard. This year, aa never before, it is
desirable that we should concentrate upon
tourist travel.
Changes have taken place south of the
line which have a direct bearing on the situation, and undoubtedly will to some extent

295

reduce the volume of tourist travel from that
country. In addition there is the attraction
of the Chicago Fair to be taken into account.
Last year approximately twenty million
people visited the Fair, and, as this attraction
is being continued this year, it will undoubtedly have a direct influence upon the
trend of travel by American tourists.
The provincial government departments,
tourist bureaux, transportation companies,
hotel associations, and many other organizations throughout the country have been doing excellent and effective work in advertising the advantages of Canada as a tourist
land. Much good work also bas been done
by federal agencies, but I do feel that here
at Ottawa there is need for a greater realization of the value of the tourist trade. More
intensive efforts should be made to coordinate the work being donc throughout the
Dominion, and so give it greater impetus
and more effective direction.
In the Maritime Provinces we have what
we believe to be unrivalled attractions for the
tourist. Certainly we have an ideal summer
climate; the days are bright and cool, the
evenings freshened by breezes from the nearby sea. Within the radius of a few hundred
miles we have varied scenery-hills, valleys,
rushing rivers and placid lakes, fertile agricultural lands, and rugged and picturesque
sea coast, and ample opportunity for fishing,
hunting, boating and golfing, with excellent
modern hotels and resorts available everywhere. In no place in the world, I am informed, can so many tourist attractions be
found within such a relatively small area.
Industrial development of a wide and general nature follows the tourist industry. This
is largely so because of the many channels
through which the money spent by the
tourists circulates: through hotels to retail
merchants, farmers, labourers and others;
through garages to mechanies, manufacturers,
and others; through theatres, retail stores,
transportation companies. All these factors
enter into the distribution of the money spent
by tourists.
I am sure it would be money well spent
if the federal authorities made a greater outlay on tourist publicity within Canada itself,
as well as outside the Dominion. Federal
recognition of the economic value of the
tourist trade could not be demonstrated to
greater advantage than through an extensive
program of publiiy to induce our own
people to see their own country before seeking interest and recreation beyond their own
borders. There is no better investment for
our youth-future citizens in the makingthan to travel and study their own country.

296

SENATE

In any consideration of this question it
should not be forgotten that the natural
attractions of the country constitute one
great asset which can be sold lavishly and
still be retained undiminished and unimpaired.
The Department of Trade and Commerce
in a report made in 1934 urges careful study
of the tourist business at the present time.
This report is comprehensive, a complete
survey in detail. Commenting on the future,
it says:
A great increase in tourist travel will
accompany the next cycle of prosperity. The
present is, then, a good time to tale stock of
this industry.
Intensive study and wise
planning

are

necessary

to conitrol

its

miany

ramifications, to eradicate undesirable efforts
to capitalize it before they becone to strongly
entrenehed and to encourage its future developMent along sound lines.
Canada's tourist
iisiness is a national asset worthy of the most
intelligent cultivation.
As honourable members will notice, my
inquiry does not call for the appointment of
a committee, but if the proposal meets with
the approval of the Senate, I would suggest
that a special committee be appointed to
examine into this matter and to recommend
ways and means for greater development of
the tourist trade, whicli is of such immense
importance to the whole country.
Hon. E. MICHENER: Honourable senators, we are indebted to the honourable member from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis) for
calling our attention to this important subject. Now that le lias broken the ice, I hope
we may hear from him frequently.
He has shown us by comparison the importance of the tourist traffic, in that it represents one of the major sources of income
of the Dominion. It is, as Le las stated,
an asset which the Government would do
well to develop. The revenue from this
traffic also helps us to counterbalance our
excess of importations and services from the
United States.
Fortunately our greatest natural asset is
our summer climate, especially that of Western Canada, where the altitude tends to cool
and invigorate the air. During the summer
months the climate of most of the Central
States is very hot and humid, and the tourist
traffic from that area is increasing rapidly
as the people there realize the benefits of a
holiday in our northern zone.
It is interesting to note to what extent
our neiglibours 'to the south are taking advantage of our invigorating and healthful holiday resorts. In 1929, as the honourable
senator bas stated, our revenue from tourist
traffic exceeded $300,000,000. In 1933 it fell
to $117,000,000.
By contrast, our
own
Hon. Mr. DENNIS.

people spent in other countries only about
$50,000,000, leaving a substantial balance in
our favour. It will be seen that the favourable balance of tourist ýtrade is an important
national asset.
I have secured statistics of the 1933 motorcar traffic. During the year 2,233,418 cars
entered Canada for less than twenty-four
hours, and 863,136 cars for a longer period.
Taking the first category, I find ýthat in
round figures the cars were distributed as
follows:
Maritime Provinces, 108,000; Quebec, 199,000; Ontario, 1,844,000; Manitoba.
22,000; Saskatchewan, 13,000; Alberta, 11,600,
and British Columbia 33,700. J regret that
my province of Alberta is at the bottom of
the list. Before resuming my seat I shall
make certain suggestions to remedy tLis
disadvantage.
So varied and attractive are climate and
scenery throughout this country from the
Atlaintic to the Pacifie, that all along the
three-thousand-mile border line separating us
from a population of 120,000,000 there are
tremendous possibilities for the development
of tourist traffic from the south. We have
in the Dominion of Canada, with its mighty
rivers and great lakes, an abundance and
varicty of fish and wild game sufficient to
satisfy the most ardent sportsman.
I am told by those who live in Prince
Edward Island that the entire province is a
summer resort. In Nova Scotia we have Digby,
St. Andrews-by-the-Sea, Evangeline Beach,
and many other very attractive summer places.
In New Brunswick also, with its rivers and
lakes, there are numerous resorts. I should
like to mention particularly Campo Bello,
where the President of the United States bas
his summer home. Next comes Quebec, with
its thousands of miles of rivers, including the
mighty St. Lawrence and the Ottawa, as well
as innumerable lakes which offer picturesque
sites for summer resorts. These places, lying
almost immediately to the north of the thickly
populated New England States, are more and
more influencing the people of those States
to spend at least part of their summers in this
country.
The province of Ontario, possibly because
of its numerous points of entry from the
United States, receives the largest number of
motor tourists of any of the provinces. Here
we have Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, the Rideau
lakes, the Muskoka lakes and many other
beautiful resorts, scattered throughout the
province. One thing which I think appeals to
the people of the country to the south of us
is the easy access which is afforded ther to
such places as the Muskoka lakes, for example,

APRIL 25, 1934
where the climate is cool, fish are plentiful,
and visitors can enjoy a complete change.
In Manitoba and Saskatchewan also there
are summer resorts which are largely patronized, though not to quite the same degree as
are those of the province of Ontario.
In Alberta we have, to the north, Jasper
Park, a resort which is known all over the
world and is growing more and more popular
with world tourists. In Central Alberta, west
of the city of Red Deer, from which I come,
we have Sylvan lake, which I know particularly well. It is fast becoming a centre for
the summer homes of the people of Calgary,
Edmonton, and other parts of the province.
Then in the far south we have the renowned
Waterton lake, where, I understand, my honourable friend from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) usually spends his summers. It
occupies a unique situation, high in the
Rockies, surrounded by scenery that is rarely
surpassed. In Banff National Park we have
perhaps one of the best known resorts on the
American continent, visited by tourists from
all parts of the world. Banff, situated at an
altitude of 5,280 feet-one mile-is surrounded
by snow-capped peaks, and these with the
rivers and valleys furnish a profusion and
variety of scenery not equalled on the North
American continent.
Unfortunately, Banff is not as easy of access
as some other places in the Dominion. Last
fall I came up from California by motor,
travelling on a beautiful paved highway, by
way of Portland and Spokane to Gateway.
When I crossed the border the paved highway
ended and I came upon a very poor gravel
road. I am told that the officials at the border
turn back to Glacier Park many people who
have intended visiting Banff National Park.
From Kingsgate to Kootenay Park, where
there is a radium hot spring, the road runs for
a distance of perhaps one hundred miles
amid the most magnificent scenery of
mountains, rivers and canyons; then, proceeding over the range of mountains, it drops
several hundred feet into the Bow valley,
bringing us into Banff National Park and
Banff. From that point tourists can go to
Lake Louise, one of the most beautiful lakes
in any part of the world, or up to the Great
Divide. Here a huge archway marks the
point where the waters divide, some streams
going out through the Fraser river into the
Pacifie, and the others into the Bow and the
Saskatchewan, and on towards the Atlantic.
The scenery along the drive is perhaps the
finest in the Rocky Mountains; in fact, I
know of no place in the American Rockies
where the highways traverse such a beautiful
and varied prospect.

297

There is wild life in profusion. Last fall
in going through Kootenay Park I came upon
a herd of moose. They were standing not
over a hundred feet from the highway, with
their heads in the air, nostrils distended, and
not a muscle stirring. It was a thrilling sight.
One can hardly go through the park without
being stopped by at least one or two black
bears. They come out on the highway and
hold you up, in the hope that you may give
them a hand-out. On the slopes of the
mountains you may see mountain sheep, deer,
antelope and elk; there are also partridge and
other game birds in plenty, with now and
then an eagle overhead. I can think of no
more thrilling holiday trip than this. Yet we
have but a gravel road down to the end of
the park.
I should like to call the attention of the
right honourable leader of the Government
to what I regard as a most productive way of
spending a part of the $50,000,000 appropriated
for unemployment relief. If the Dominion
Government would construct an asphalt road
through these national parks and co-operate
with the provincial governments of British
Columbia and Alberta for the paving of their
portions of the road, we should have a circuitous highway extending for a distance of
about five hundred miles, beginning at Kingsgate and ending at the same place, and this
would attract many people from Oregon and
Washington. I do not believe the Government could spend the money more advantageously than on improving our highways
connecting with the highways on the other
side of the line. If this were done we should
reap the benefit of the great assets that are
ours, by making them accessible to the people
to the south of us.
I need only mention the beauties of British
Columbia. They are so well known that it
is unnecessary to dwell upon them at length.
I endorse all that bas been said by the
honourable gentleman from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Denis). I am much pleased that he bas
called this important matter to our attention.
One of the results, .I trust, will be that our
own people will learn to appreciate the many
advantages possessed by Canada and will
henceforth spend their money in their own
country.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable
gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the honourable member from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Dennis) on the very excellent debut he bas
made in this House. The description that he
has given of the Maritime Provinces is interesting indeed. We know from the illustrated
papers we receive from time to time that they

SENATE
are but one of the many gardens of Eden to
be found scattered throughout Canada.
I should like to see, however, some action
on the part of the provincial governments in
regard to improving hotel facilities, especially in the rural sections. I speak particularly
with reference to my own province. It is true
that in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, and
some other places we have very fine hotels,
but in the rural sections generally there is
much room for improvement. I hope the
provincial governments will sec to it tîat these
improvements are made.
My honourable friend has spoken of the
Maritime Provinces. I lay claim to having
come from a maritime province, the province
of Quebec. For thirty-six years I have been
the representative of the county of Gaspé,
which is truly part of the Maritimes. In that
county we have a magnificent coast-line and
some marvels of nature which are unsurpassed. I have only to mention the Percé
Rock, Bonaventure Island and Mont Sainte
Aune to recall Brittany to one who has
travelled in Europe.
There is nothing like tourist facilities to
attract general attention to a country. As my
honourable frien'd has said, the tourist trade
develops business and encourages the expenditurc of money by those who are well to do.
At this point may I tell the House that
this summer Canada is going to be invaded
by the French. Perhaps this information could
better be given by my good friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and my
right honourable friend from Eganville (Rigbt
Hon. Mr. Graham), because they are the
president and vice-president in charge of the
Jacques Cartier celebrations at Gaspé. We
are going te have eight hundred delegates
from various parts of France. It is rumoured
that they will be headed by a cardinal of the
French church, one or two members of the
French Academy and a very eminent marshal
of France. They are coming to attend the
ceremonies to be held in Gaspé in connection
with the celebration of the fourth centennial
of the discovery of Canada. The scenes to
be enacted will, I am sure, never be forgotten.
First, there will be at Prince Edward's Island,
near Charlottetown, the unveiling of a cairn
on the spot where Jacques Cartier first landed,
four hundred years ago. Then the famous
new French liner, the Champlain, will come
north, hugging the New Brunswick coast,
swing around Bonaventure Island, pass by
Percé Rock and into the Bay of Gaspé. Here
the Dominion Government, I am proud to say,
has consented to erect a cross thirty feet
high, which is to be a facsimile of the cross
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

planted by Cartier four hundred years ago
when he took possession of the soil. This
unveiling will be accompanied by memorable
ceremonies wbich I shall not attempt to
describe.
The interesting feature of this from the
tourist point of view is that at least half of
these eight hundred tourists will travel to
Quebec and Montreal. Along the River St.
Lawrence they will enjoy a most picturesque
spectacle. Other ceremonies will take place
at Quebec, followed by a celebration at Three
Rivers of the tercentenary of the foundation
of that city. The visitors, I am informed,
intend to continue their journey to Ottawa,
and thence to Toronto for the centennial of
that city and the great National Exhibition,
which takes place at the beginning of September. From there they will proceed to Fort
Niagara to attend the ceremonies of reconstruction there. It is hoped that the President
of the. United States will be present at Fort
Niagara, and possibly in Toronto; but of
that there is no certainty.
The occasion will be a magnificent one.
Many of these visitors intend to go to the
West, where they have some holdings, and
where there are many settlements of interest
te them. I am quite sure they will be greatly
impressed by their visit to the West. especially
by the district around Calgary, Edmonton,
and the Crow's Nest Pass, not to speak of
the Rockies.
The question raised this afternoon by my
genial friend from Halifax is a most important
one, and should not be lost sight of by the
country. It is truc that wc must help our
railway systems to get out of the morass in
which they find themselves. Neverthcless, in
the interest of the country as a whole, our
highways must not be neglected. I am glad
that I have had the opportunity of listening
to the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Dennis). He bas certainly rendered a great
service te bis own province and to the country
at large.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, I should like to congratulate my friend
of many years standing, and one of the newest
of our colleagues (Hon. Mr. Dennis), upon the
information that he bas given us. I would
also make a suggestion to the speaker who
has preceded me. Cape Breton, as a place
of beauty, yields the palm to no other section
of the country. To those who are in charge
of the Jacques Cartier celebration at Gaspé
I would point out the fact that there
are on the coast of Cape Breton the remains
of a little town that once occupied a very
important place in the affairs of the Empire.

APRIL 25, 1934
I refer to Louisburg, which was founded in
1730 and fell in 1758. During that period
there was in the town an active civie life,
dependent upon the fisheries, which constituted
the chief industry of the northern British
colonies of that time. By way of illustrating
the persistence of the people who lived on our
shores in those days, let me refer briefly to
a French family forced to leave Port Royal
at the time of its capture by the British in
1710. The family moved to Louisburg, whence
they were obliged to flee in 1745, when that
town was taken by New England troops.
Peace was restored in 1749 and the family
came back, but in 1758 the town was once
more captured and they were driven out again.
Then they went to Saint Pierre-Miquelon,
but they were expelled from there in the
later war. After peace was restored they
returned and resumed -the fishing business.
In 1790 the then members of the family
appealed to the Revolutionary Assembly in
France for aid in carrying on this hereditary
business after their many losses. The name
of the family was Rodigue. It seems to me
that persistency of that kind is as worthy of
commemoration as the bravery of persons
wh'o distinguish themselves in war on sea
or land. I therefore should like to make
a suggestion to the committee in charge of
the forthcoming celebrations at Gaspé, and
«I am sure the suggestion could be conveyed by no one more forcefully than by
the honourable senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux). It is that the dignitaries who participate in the celebrations
should visit Louisburg and receive the modest
hospitality oi Cape Breton; and that the
visiting French and English ships should on
their return trip spend some time in Louisburg harbour. These visits would indicate
an appreciation of great deeds of the past,
which in time to come will be commemorated
by a permanent memorial such as it is not
convenient to erect at present. They would
harmonize perfectly with the great ceremonies
in Quebec, and I feel sure would be kindly
regarded, not only by the people of the
Maritimes, but by al: who are proud of the
glorious history of Canada.
Honourable
Hon. R. DANDURAND:
senators, I desire to join with my colleagues
in commending the action of the honourable
gentleman from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis).
The matter which he has brought to our
attention is of very great importance. He
asks that the Federal Government endeavour
to obtain the co-operation of the various
provinces in promoting the tourist trade, and
I can tell him that no province will be more
eager to co-operate than Quebec. In recent

299

years that province has made much progress
in the encouragement and development of the
tourist traffic. The roads and highways have
been improved and our hotels have been
equipped to give the most acceptable service.
One step has been taken of which my honourable friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux) is unaware. The provincial Minister of Highways paid the costs of a trip to
Montreal for a number of country hotelkeepers so that they might take cooking
lessons there and on their return improve
the standard of meals in the rural districts.
The province has for some time been carrying on a campaign urging farmers to brighten
with paint the exteriors of their houses and
other wooden buildings along the highway.
In this and other respects the attempts to
attract increasingly large numbers of tourists
to the country has met with widespread support on the part of the people.
Honourable
MacARTHUR:
Hon. C.
senators, the honourable gentleman from
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis) is very deservedly
receiving congratulations, in which I wish
to join, for his timely action in bringing to
our attention the subject of the tourist trade.
I trust I shall not be considered parochial for
saying a few words with particular reference
to Prince Edward Island, my native province.
I am hopeful that the right honourable
leader of the House *ill take a personal
interest in the honourable gentleman's inquiry
whether it is possible for the Government
to secure the co-operation of the provincial
authorities and transportation interests towards the greater development of the tourist
trade. We have heard a great deal about
Maritime Rights. Better transportation facilities might be considered one of Prince
Edward Island's minor rights. In no other
part of Canada is there any difficulty about
Generally
interprovincial communication.
speaking, the boundaries are imaginary lines.
But in Prince Edward Island we are separated from the rest of the country by straits
nine miles wide, and in the winter it is often
difficult for even our new two-million-dollar
icebreaker to make schedule connections with
trains on. the mainland.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You need a tunnel.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: A tunnel has
often been advocated, and so has a bridge.
If we had a conneoting link of either kind the
tolls would be only nominal. Up to a short
time ago anyone entering or leaving Prince
Edward Island with a motor car had to pay
a ferry charge of $5 for the automobile one
way, and of course the chauffeur and passengers had to buy tickets at the usual rates.

300

SENATE

The present charge for a oar is $4 for the
one-way trip and $7 return, and during the
tourist season, from June 15 to September
15, there is a special rate of $3 and $5.
But this is still too high and results in keeping away many prospective visitors. A large
number of appeals for the reduction of these
charges have been made to the Federal Government by our provincial premier, boards of
trade and tourist association. After years of
importuning, the cost of operating the car
ferry, which had previously been charged to
the Atlantic
division of the Canadian
National Railways, was transferred last year
to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Therefore, in a sense, the charge on the carriage of
automobiles across the straits is no longer a
matter coming under the jurisdiction of the
Board of Trustees of the Canadian National,
and the authority to adjust the charge lies
with the Minister of Railways. After all, the
ferry is but a substitute for a bridge, and
only a nominal charge such as a bridge toll
should be exacted. If this were donc there
would be a great influx of tourists to our
province.
Perhaps some honourable members in driving to Nova Scotia have stopped outside of
Sackville and considercd the advisabilitv of
turning to the left, proceeding thirty miles to
Cape Tormantine and there taking the car
ferry across the straits to Borden on Prince
Edward Island. I can state with assurance
that anyone who spends the extra time and
incurs the slightly additional cost entailed by
that trip will be well repaid. In the first
place, the ferry is of a completely modern
type, with a special automobile deck that
accommodates from fifty to sixty cars. On
the old ferry it was necessary to load the
automobiles onto flat cars, a procedure which
resulted in some extra cost and loss of time
in embarking and disembarking, but machines
can be driven on and off the new ferry under
their own power. In the second place, the
seenic effects are particularly good. I have
driven several times all over Canada from
the Atlantic to the Pacific; I have on many
occasions come through the Matapedia valley
on my way to Ottawa; I have made a
number of trips to the Bras d'Or Lakes;
I have motored through the Annapolis valley
in the apple blossom season. The beauties
of each of these localities have been observed
and appreciated. And while I do not wish
to make invidious comparisons, I can assure
honourable members that if what has been
said of the other provinces were multiplied
tenfold it still would be inadequate to
describe the attractions of Prince Edward
Island.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR.

The honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) has told us of
some of the interesting historical events connected with Gaspé. I would remind him that
Jacques Cartier was the first visitor of note
to Prince Edwa.rd Island.
He landed at
Charlottetown in 1534.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
tourist.

He was the first

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The first tourist.
This is what he wrote home:
All the land is low and the most beautiful
it is possible to see, and full of beautiful trees
and meadows.
Although for many years I have been an
officer of the tourist association in my province, I never was so enthusiastie as I now
arn about what the province has to offer to
visitors. As all honourable members know,
we have at Charlottetown a fine new hotel.
It bas been the subject of much criticism, but
there is no doubt about the high quality of
its accommodation and service. In addition
there are all over the Island beautiful and
comfortable homes in which tourists are made
very welcome and given the best of everything, at reasonable charges. Cattle inspection ensures freedom from animal disease,
and our dairy and farm products are second
to none. People who want country life can
find it there, combined with facilities for surf
bathing, shooting, fishing and many other
kinds of outdoor sport.
With the permission of honourable members I will read a short extract from a folder
issued by the Prince Edward Island Tourist
Association:
The smallest province of the Dominion of
Canada.
But the most thickly populated.
Frequently referred to as "The Million Acre
Farrn" and "The Denmark of Canada."
Finest summer climate in the world. Set in
the midst of the salt sea, with neither extreme
of heat or cold, and fog unknown. Invigorating,
restful. refreshing; and wonderful bathing all
around its coast.
Nowhere in all America can be found its
duplicate.
In sommer a garden of perfect
beauty fanned by cooling breezes from the
ocean, with mile after mile of sandy beaches.
There is a great deal more that I should
like to read, but anyone interested can get
descriptive literature on application to the
secretary of the association at Charlottetown.
I have on hand a number of copies of the
folder from which I read, and shall be glad
to distribute them at any time.
One of the principal attractions for visitors
to the province is the Dominion Experimental
Fox Station at Summerside, to which town
it was transferred a few years ago from Rull
or Aylmer. This efficient institution has a
wonderful property that is well worth seeing.

APRIL 25, 1934
There are some fine buildings, one of which
contains a well equipped laboratory. On the
staff is an expert dietitian, Dr. G. Ennis Smith.
Alsa at Summerside is a splendid building
which. houses the headquarters of the Canadian National Fox Breeders' Association and
is the scene of the association's annual meetings. There are in the Island some large
fox farms, some of which maintain as many
as 1,000 foxes at a time.
Every year great numbers of native Prince
Edward Islanders come home for a visit from
the United States. We cannot strictly classify
them as tourists, because they spend their
vacations at the homes of relatives or friends
who still live among us. The real tourist is
more apt to travel widely over the province
and take in the principal sights. To such we
give a special welcome. I can assure anyone that the money and time spent on a trip
to Prince Edward Island will yield generous
returns in pleasure at the time and pleasant
memories for long years to come.
In closing may I express to the honourable
gentleman from Halifax my appreciation of
the interesting and succinct way in which he
presented his facts to us. He referred to the
wide range of information compiled by the
Bureau of Statisties. On reading some of
these figures I was amazed to learn how
large a sum of money is spent annually in
this country by tourists. The possibilities of
the tourist trade have rightly been described
by the honourable gentleman as immense.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I desire to add my tribute of appreciation to
those already tendered to my honourable
friend from Halifax. I endorse all that he
said with regard to the benefits derived by
this country from the tourist traffie, which
bas grown so rapidly in recent years and will,
I trust, grow at an increasing rate in the
future.
Were I inclined to compete with other
honourable gentlemen who have extolled the
beauties of their respective provinces, I feel
sure that in describing New Brunswick I could
make a more enthusiastic address than any
we have heard. But since the honourable
senator from Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener)
used a New Brunswick summer resort as a
standard in praising the attractions of Nova
Scotia, I think I need onily draw attention to
this fact. Al the provinces of Canada are
beautiful in their own way, and we should not
try to create the impression that any one of
them offers to the visitor from outside a
superior kind of scenery or hospitality. In
this House we should treat the tourist question, as all other questions, from a national
rather than a local point of view. People

301

who listen to or read what we say here should
have reason to feel that the Senate is concerned with advancing the interests of Canada
as a whole, rather than those of any section.
The figures quoted by my honourable friend
to show the value of the tourist traffic are
realy amazing. Had I not heard them read
I should not have believed it possible that
so much money could have been expended on
this account. It is only fair to point out that
it is expenditure for the purchase of natural
wealth which we produce. In other words,
every tourist, to the extent of his purchases,
improves the market for our products of the
farm, the forest and the sea. In this respect
the tourist is one of the most important factors
in our trade.
It has been stated in another place that
a dollar spent within our borders by a tourist
is not as good as five cents raised by the
country itself. I do not know whether that
is correct or not. I am inclined to think it
is an exaggeration. It is said that our tourist
revenue last year amounted to 300,000,000.
Let us assume that $200,000,000 has been
produced in the form of farm products. It
represents new wealth. But for this new
wealth you must find a market to turn it into
cash. The value of the tourist traffic is that it
furnishes a market primarily to our producers
of farm products and secondly ta others who
supp4ly the tourist's requirements.
The negotiation of trade agreements with
various countries helps to increase our volume
of export business; but after listening to the
figures quoted this afternoon, it seems to me
that we have been losing sight of perhaps one
of the best markets, almost at our very doors.
Recent changes in certain laws in the country
to the south are certain to affect adversely
our tourist traffic from that quarter: many
thirsty tourists who formerly visited Canada
are likely to remain in their own country. To
offset this we should, as pointed out by the
honourable senator from Halifax and those
who followed him in this debate, develop new
attractions in a more emphatie way in order
to bring to the notice of those looking for
change of scenery the many natural attractions in all the provinces. If this is donc
there will be, I am satisfied, a growing stream
of tourist traffic from the United States, with
a commensurate augmentation of eur revenue
from this source. It would be well also to
advertise Canada's many holiday attractions
in Europe. Ours should be the greatest tourist
country in the world, and it can be if
appropriate measures are taken to this end.
Hon. H. C. HOCKEN: I am sure that
every honourable member appreciates the
service which the honourable senator from

302

SENATE

Halifax (Hon. -Mr. Dennis) has rendered by
initiating this discussion. I hope he will get
his committee and that it will be able to
co-ordinate to some degree the activities of
all the agencies now working for the improvement of our tourist trade.
I was glad to hear the honourable senator
from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) state
that this year we are to have a large number of tourists from France and from the
province of Quebec visiting Ontario and the
West. I can assure him that the people of
Ontario will give these visitors a very warm
welcome.
It bas been my good fortune at various
times to visit all ,the Maritime Provinces, and
I look back to a very pleasant six weeks that
I spent in Prince Edward Island. I stayed
at the little town of Souris for some time,
then at Charlottetown and at other points.
Everywhere I found excellent accommodation.
For the past five years I have spent my
summer vacation in the province of Quebec
and have always enjoyed myself. The splendid attractions of these provinces differ in
many respects, but they are all delightful to
those who come from the congested centers
of the republic to the south.
I notice by the statistics quoted that during the past year Ontario tas attracted a
greater number of tourists than any of the
other provinces.
This I attribute to its
accessibility. For example, the city of Toronto is only a night's journey from all the great
centers in the Middle West, in the East and
for some distance in the South. A person
living in Chicago, New York, Pittsburg, Philadelphia or some other American city can
spend a very inexpensive holiday in Ontario.
As I say, it is only a night's journey to
Toronto, and with this as a base, Muskoka,
Nipigon and other delightful holiday resorts
are within easy reach.
There are tangible advantages, other than
financial, incident to the interchange of
visits between our people and our neighbours
tu the south, and especially between people
of different provinces. When I have been
in the Maritimes I have discovered that the
people think that more of their fellow Canadians in Ontario should make a practice
of visiting their provinces-a sentiment that
I heartily endorse. I happen to know that a
good many persons in Ontario make periodical visits to the Maritime Provinces. Judge
Morson, of Toronto, is about as well known
in Nova Scotia as in Ontario. He bas been
visiting there for twenty odd years. I might
mention other prominent residents of my city
who are quite at home in Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. This is
Hon. Mr. IOCKEN.

a form of tourist traffic that we might well
encourage.
I repeat, I should like to see a committee
appointed as suggested by the honourable
member from Halifax. I am confident that
such a committee, after considering all the
factors, would be able to devise a plan to
bring about such a co-ordination of effort
as would stimulate tourist traffic interprovincially, and also attract larger numbers of
tourists from the United States. There is no
doubt that tourist traffic in some of our provinces is a very important source of revenue.
This revenue is all profit, and at this time, as
stated by the honourable gentleman from
Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener), the tourist
traffic from the United States plays an important part in bringing about a balance of
our trade with that country.
I trust that the representations of the tonourable gentleman from Halifax will receive
favouraible consideration and be productive
of highly satisfactory results.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, our bonourable colleague from Halifax
has made a very successful first effort. He
has presented to us gracefully, clearly and
convincingly a carefully prepared address. I
congratulate him on the brilliancy of his
pronouncement, but also, and still more, on
the timely and important matter which he
lias laid before the House.
To secure markets for our surplus products
it is necessary to overcome a multitude of
obstacles-tariffs, quotas, even the nature of
the products themselves, some being too
perishable for transportation to distant markets. On the other hand the tourist trade
is the exportation of your products to the
foreign buyer while te is within your own
country. Instead of sending your goods to
a buyer on the other side of the frontier, you
bring the buyer to your own country and
sell the goods to him there.
This business bas practically no limits, for
you can sell anything on your interior market
without let or hindrance. That is the first
great advantage. The second is that once
you establish the routes of tourist trade
nothing disturbs them. Contrast this with
what frequently happens to expert trade. We
have spent millions and millions of dollars
and years and years of effort to establish
channels of trade with the United States;
then almost overnight a prohibitive tariff
wall is raised against our goods, and all our
expenditure of money and effort is lost. With
tourist trade, or exportation from the interior,
there is no such danger. If you encourage a
purchaser te buy your goods here, the oftener

APRIL 25, 1934
lie comes the more lie learns about the
country, and the more frequently will lie
return to make further purchases. Honourable members who have travelled in Europe
know that certain countries there live on
nothing but tourist trade. Where would
Switzerland be without it? What does she
produce? Practically nothing. I am told that
tourist trade has enabled France to pay more
than half of lier war debt. My colleague
on my right reminds me that in France
tourist matters are controlled by a special
departnent. There a national commission is
charged with the duty of attracting tourists
and ensuring their comfort and safety during
their visit.
While we have made some progress in
rendering Canada attractive to visitors from
the United States and other countries, we
have still a great deal of work to do in this
respect. My honourable friend from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) has reminded us
that we should have bettér equipped hotels.
I agree with him. If I nay dare to give
advice, particularly to the people of my province, I would say to them: Do not forget that
strangers come to a strange land to see strange
things. May I cite this as an example?
When our friends from across the line come
to the province of Quebec they do not come
to see things common to the North American
continent; they come to see a land of
romance, to read some fragments of French
history in our landscape, our architecture, and
certainly in the character and language of
our people. If I may venture to give advice
to the honourable Minister of Roads of my
province, the gentleman in charge of tourist
affaira, I would beg hirn to encourage the
people to retain their racial characteristics.
I wish to thank our colleague from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux) and our colleague
from Sydney (Hon. Mr. McLennan) for their
kind remarks in reference to a matter which
has been entrusted in particular to my right
honourable colleague from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) and to myself. As lie
is too modest to make an acknowledgment,
I suppose I shal have to do it for both of
us. I regret his self-effacement, for I cannot
hope to equal his felicity of language and
charm of manner. I may tell my honourable
friend from Rougemont that lie has presented
the programme to the House in great detail
and with a fuller knowledge than I myself
possess. I am happy to hear that personalities such as lie has mentioned have been invited to attend the Jacques Cartier tercentenary. It will be in fact a celebration of
the birthday of Christianity and of western
civilization on this continent. It is the birthday of all Canadians; there can be no greater

birthday. I may tell him frankly that I
am not yet aware what invitations the Canadian Government intends to send out, but
I presume that, quite naturally, invitations
will be addressed to the highest personalities
in Great Britain, France and the United
States. In fact, looking towards my leader
on the right (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), I
think I may promise as much, for no country
can have a greater interest in the celebration
than Great Britain, France and the United
States. I am confident they will send as
representatives their most distinguished
public men.
I am thankful also to my colleague froin
Sydney (Hon. Mr. MeLennan) for the sympathetic way in which lie stated that the
people from his province were eager to participate in the event. I take his remarke to
be typical of the attitude of every province
and every race in Canada towards this great
historie birthday. The circumstances are such
that we anticipate the celebration will be unsurpassed in its historie significance and international appeal. I trust that all honourable
members who can possibly spare the time will
attend. They may be absolutely certain that
the people of Gaspé, and, may I add, of my
province, for the festivities will begin in
Quebec, will receive them with the warmest
hospitality in appreciation of their taking
part in the celebration of the birthday not
only of the whole country, but, I cannot
help thinking, more especially of the French
race in the province of Quebec, members of
which are now settled throughout the whole
Dominion.
So, honourable gentlemen, may I say au
revoir and, in due time, at Gaspé.
Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable gentlemen, I am not sure that all the speeches
delivered this afternoon have been entirely
relevant to the subject-matter proposed lç
the honourable member frorn Halifax. If I
understand the resolution presented by him,
lie is asking the Federal Government to cooperate with the provinces with a view to
encouraging tourist traffic. Wandering all
over in an effort to arouse the patriotism of
people so that they may visit Quebec is more
or less foreign to the resolution. Nevertheless,
if what has been said encourages someone
to visit our province, there is no harm done,
and I am willing to join with everyone who
has invited people to visit us; and I assure
thern they will be welcome.
But to come to the resolution itself, in what
way is the Federal Government to co-operate
with the provinces in order to encourage
tourist traffic? Is it to be by the building
of roads or by the providing of more accom-

304

SENATE

modation?
I have travelled through the
provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, British
Columbia and Ontario, and have found everything most comfortable; the roads are excellent, and the communications between the
provinces are perfect. The province of Quebec, of course, may properly be called a
maritime province, because we have a long
coast line, and are neiglibours of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.
But there is one place, possibly, where cooporation between the federal authorities and
the provincial authorities might do something to improve the means of communication
between Quebec and New Brunswick. There
is to-day between Campbellton in New
Brunswick and Cross Point in the province
of Quebec a ferry across the Restigouche
river. This ferry, which is the only means
of communication between the whole of the
Gaspé coast and New Brunswick, is supposed
to make the crossing every hour, but it does
not always do se. The result is that the
tourist from New Brunswick, when ho learns
that he has to take a chance on whether the
ferry will be ready to carry him across the
river, goes back into the province that he has
just traversed. The same is truc of the people
who come clown from the Gaspé coast; they
return by the same road over which they
have come, without going on to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, or, possibly, to Prince
Edward

Island.

If

any

representations are

to be made to the Federal Government
towards co-operation with the provincial
authorities, I think it might be pointed out
that one of the best services that could be
performed in the interest of the tourist trade
of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince
Edward Island and Quebec would be the
building of a bridge between Campbellton
and Cross Point.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, before the debate closes I
desire to say a very few words and to offer
a suggestion to the House.
We all welcome the honourable senator from
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis) to our deliberations. We cannot very well wish for him
anything botter than that the rapid and extraordinary success he as made of a concrete enterprise in his own province should
have its counterpart in an illustrious public
career.
The development of the world in the last
half century bas been marked chiefly by a
tremendous and almost unimaginable expansion
of the
means
of transportation.
Mechanization, whiclh bas been the outstanding feature of human effort for many years,
Hon. Mr. PARENT.

bas shown itself most plainly and usefully in
the sphere of transportation-in the carrying
of the human voice, the human message,
and of man himself--on a scale and by a
variety of methods undreamed of by our
ancestors. This bas really been the genesis
of the tourist traffic, because the travel industry bas reached its present dimensions
only within comparatively late years. But
for transportation facilities, but for the breaking down of distances through the mechanization of these times, we should never have
known the tourist traffic as we know it now.
As the process goes on we shall sec an expansion of this business in all corners of the
world; and the country that is most alive to
its opportunities will be the one to reap the
largest reward.
It is true that this country bas net been
asleep. We have not failed to realize the
possibilities. Perhaps we have net done all
that we might have done, and even now are
not doing all that we could, but we have
secured a fairly good share of what was to be
obtained on this North American continent.
In proportion to population far more Canadians travel and holiday in the United States
than there are citizens of that republic
travelling and holidaving in the Dominion of
Canada. Their climate is warmer than ours,
and this becomes an advantage at the period
of the year when there is most leisure for
travel. We have succeeded pretty well in
setting off against the advantage a variety and
rarity of scenerv which that country cannot
boast. The figures given by the honourable
senator from Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener)
were indeed impressive.
I do not know that I can add much to the
information of the House along the lines that
have been pursued, but there is one matter I
want to empliasize. The organization that this
country lias established for the purpose of
getting tourist traffic bas been on a provincial
basis. Eaclh province bas competed with the
others for its share of the federal expenditure,
and each province bas itself gone heavily into
debt with a view to making certain of getting
its share. In tbis respect it is probable that
Ontario bas gone the farthest of all, even in
proportion to its strength. The debt of the
province of Ontario is relatively higli compared with that of any other eastern province,
at least. But a very considerable proportion
of it is represented, of course, by investments
which are not only sound, but certain to be
revenue-bearing, and can therefore be deducted from the total. Ontario's expenditure
on roads bas far exceeded the expenditure
by any other province. While I do not know

APRIL 25, 1934
the exact figures, 1 may say that a very large
part of the $188,000,00)0 of Ontario's debt wbich
is not offset by revenue-bearing investments
hias been incurred on roads. It is largely as a
consequence of that expenditure that the
tourist trafflc of Ontario far trainscends that
of any other eastern province.
The income derîved by Ontario from the
tourist traffic last year totalled 82,339,000more than double the amount received by
any other province. 0f course there is no
direct revenue to the treasury from this traffic,
but indirect resuits are the receipts from
the tax on gaso4ine and the very substantial
revenue derived from 'the 518,000 motor
licences issued. Ontario's revenue from. this
source is, I believe, more than three itîmes
that of any other province. Ahl that these
figures illustrate is the fact that it is worth
while incurring debts and obligations in order
to secure trade of this character. It has
proved profitable, and is going to prove more
so. In this sphere, however, as in every
other sphere of effort and reward, the returns
diminish during a period of depression; and
they diminish more rapidly than do 'those in
stable trades that of necessî'ty continue more
or less at the samne level during good times
and bad. On the other hand, while the
returns from tourist trade are about the flrst
to diminish, they are also, among the first to
return; and as the tourist traffie of the future
will undoubtedly far exceed that of the past,
we have much to hope for in the years to
corne in tbis sphere of Canadian business.
Now, what is the Dominion Government
doing to help along the work? 1 said that
the tourist organization was chiefly provincial.
But it is not wholly so. The Dominion
Government maintains the national parks of
Canada, and these parks are the main inducement to tourists to corne to this Dominion.
They are flot by any means tbe only inducement, nor are tbey alone in providing scenic
attractions, but they represent the principal
effort of the Dominion of Canada tuwards
making this country a point of interest to
the tourists of the world. Tbe cost of maintaining these parks is substantiail-the limit
I cannot suggest at the moment-and the
responsibility for their maintenance hias always
belonged, and no doubt always will belong,
to the Dominion.
Large expenditures have been made upon
roads in Jasper Park in the Rocky Mountains.
It is indecd an expensive venture to penetrate
the Rocky Mountains in order to make travel
possible. I remember very vîvidly. in the
period of de.pression which almost immediately
foliowed the War, endeavouriýng, in the face of

considerable resistance, to have appropriations
put tbrough to enable the Dominion to take
over frosu British Columbia the responsibility
in regard to- the Banff-Windermere road. I
hesitate to say that Canada could not have
made a more remunerative investment, but,
sub e.ct to a specific study of tbe enterprise
suggested by the honourable gentleman frosu
Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener), I do not
doubt that we sbould he using ýmoney to great
advantage if we were to imprave the road hie
deseibed in order to make the entrance to
Jasper Park easier for American tourists.
Tbe work of maintaining the parks is conducted by the National Parks Branch of the
Department of tbe Interior. There were
formerly two branches, and their energies were
somewhat dissipated. Now there is only the
one brancb, and a considerable number of
historic sites scattered over the whole
Dominion are also under its charge. These
sites, maintained by the Dominion, are being
added to constantly, and their surroundings
improved, and in this way the Dominion is
doing inuch to assist -the tourist trade.
But tbe main work done by the Dominion
15 this.
Information as to 'Canadian attractions, especially in relation to national parks
and historic sites, is disseminated systematically throughout the tourist countries of the
world, chiefly in the 'United States. The
railways maintain correspondence bureaus, as
do the provinces, and certain boards of trade
make efforts of their own. The endeavour of
tbe Dominion bas been to help in co-ordinating these agencies and to avoid duplication
in distributing information in particular
centres wbich are the objectives of bands
of tourists from various parts. I believe the
department recognizes that it would be within our power to organize better our endeavour
in this regard. It recognizes, perhaps, that
the objective of its policy is too close ahead
and that we are not looking far enough into
the future.
If I were to make any specific criticism it
would -be that in our attempts to reacb
foreign tourists we bave to a dcgree overlooked our own people, with the consequence,
lamented particularly by the honourable senator from Halifax, that there is too great a
disposition on the part of Canadians to travel
south, and too little to sce the land of their
birth. The variety of climate and scenery
and other attractions ini Canada is s0 great,
and the diversity of character and origin of
our people so marked, that much more could
be done than is being done, it seemns to me,
to increase the tourist traffic of our own
people and to keep it within our owa
boundaries.

EEV!ED EDMTON

SENATE
I welcome the suggestion of the honourable
senator from Halifax that a committee be
appointed. Such a committee, I think, could
get valuable information from our officials,
and probably would be able to make some
recom.mendations with a view to strengthening the work of the department and particularly to the creation of a more clearly defined
policy, and a longer range of vision as part
of that policy. I therefore hope the House
will ajccept this informal notice of motion
to be moved to-morrow:
That a special conimittee of six senators be
appointed to consider the immense possibilities
of the tourist trafflic, to inquire as to the means
adopted by the Government looking to, its
encouragement and expansion, and to report to
this House.
I suggest as members of the committee the
Dennis,
senators:
honourable
following
Foster, Green and
Lemieux, Buchanan,
Hocken. If any honourable gentleman whom
I have named would prefer not to act, the
necessary change will be made before the
motion is moved to-morrow.
Will you please
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
drop imy name? I am net well enough to
attend to connittee work.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, I had not intended to participate
in this discussion until I heard the remarks
of the right honourable leader of the louse
with respect to national parks. It is truc
that the parks at Banff and Jasper are extensively advertised by the Canadian National
Railway System, which finds it advisable to
advertise for business reasons; but there are
many national parks of which the people in
this country and abroad knew very little,
because the only publicity respecting them is
the limited amount issued by the Department
of the Interior. I believe there ought to be
a definite programme of publicity of our
parks, conducted not only in Canada, but in
the United States and Great Britain as well.
It is well known that large numbers of people
go from Great Britain to Switzerland every
year to view the mountain scenery and take
part in sports. Some of these people might
be induced to come to Canada, but I doubt
that we are bringing to the attention of any
considerable part of the British travelling
public the attractions that are to be found in
our parks.
In Alberta we have not only Waterton
National Park, running along the international
line and bordering on the Glacier National
Park of the United States, but also the parks
at Banff and Jasper. I know that a considerable number of people visit these places
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

every year, and it is only reasonable to suppose that the number would be greatly increased if more advertising were done. So far
as I am aware, the only way in which
Americans can hear of these parks is through
addresses given every winter by Mr. Campbell,
of the Parks Branch of the Department of
the Interior, before clubs, boards of trade and
other organizations in some of the Pacifie
and northwestern States and probably in
parts of the Middle West. But I question
whether lie finds time to get to the eastern
and southern sections of the country. And I
do not know that anyone is telling the story
of our national parks to British audiences.
I have in mind a suggestion which may
strike some honourable senators as ridiculous.
All over the world there are people who
like to go to out-of-the-way and unusual
places.
For instance, I have no doubt a
good many people would be glad to take
advantage of an opportunity to visit the
North Pole, if they could do so in comfort
and without having to iose too much time.
Now, during the summer months we have
railroad connection to Aklavik, which is close
to the North Pole. The suggestion I want to
make is that we should exploit Aklavik, as
well as other places, such as Fort Churchill.
Were we to do so we might build up a
considerable addition to our tourist traffic by
attracting travellers who would on their return home derive pleasure from boasting,
"I have been within the Arctic circle," or
"I have stood on the shores of Hudson Bay."
It may be objected that there is no tourist
accommodation in the Far North, but it is
my understanding that the Canadian National
accommodates travellers to Churchill with
living quarters on the trains. The deficit on
the Churchill branch line might be considerably reduced if summer excursions were
conducted.
I know a considerable number of persons
who have gone to Aklavik and vicinity, and
who report that not only is the trip interesting, but it reveals some of the tremendous
natural resources of our Northwest Territories. If we could induce people to go up
into that part of our country there would
soon be ample tourist accommodation available.
I believe it would be to the advantage of
this country, in financial and other ways, to
give much greater publicity in Great Britain,
the United States and throughout the Dominion to our national parks in particular, as
well as to some unusual and isolated sections
of the Northwest.

APRIL 25, 1934
Hon. CHARLES MURPHY: Honourable
senators, may I point out to my honourable
friend from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan)
that, should we have another winter of the
kind we have just passed through, any
tourists who desire to visit Aklavik or other
regions for a climate approximating that of
the North Pole need not travel farther than
the capital of the Dominion. And here they
would get hotel accommodation such as my
honourable friend says is not available in the
Arctic.
I do not intend to take up much time after
the splendid discussion we have had this
afternoon. In the first place, if the whole
vocabulary of compliments has not been exhausted, let me appropriate what remains and
offer it to the honourable gentleman from
Halifax for the inquiry te has made and the
instructive speech with which he supported
it. Allow me also to congratulate him upon
the success which has already attended his
effort, as evidenced by the speech of the right
honourable leader of the House and the
motion of which he gave notice.
The right honourable gentleman referred to
what one branch of the department over which
he so worthily presided a few years ago is
doing in connection with the marking of
historic areas. That excited the thought that
an endeavour might be made to interest
the people of certain places in developing the
history of such local sites as would make a
strong appeal to tourists. As was said by my
honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), tourists do not come to see,
and they should not be shown, things that
can be seen at home; they wish to see something different. Therefore it seems to me that
we should try to develop throughout the
country a keener interest in local history. In
the long run the result would be an increase
in not only local but national patriotism. By
way of illustrating the common lack of
knowledge of local sites which have historical
associations, may I ask how many honourable
members now listening to me are aware that
within fifty-five miles of this Chamber there
was fought the last battle that took place in
North America betwen the French and the
English for supremacy on this continent?
The fact is that that battle was fought at
Chimney Island, which is three miles below
Prescott, in the Saint Lawrence river. Yet
very littie is heard of that place. How many
honourable members know that from the brink
of the hill on which this building stands the
course of part of Champlain's journey can be
traced? And how many know that from the
same vantage point a part of the route
travelled by the great Jesuit martyr Father
Brebeuf is visible, as is also one of the places
74728-20J

307

where he camped, just above the Chaudiere
Falls? Sites of great historical interest are
to be found not only in and about this capital
city, but throughout our country, and could
be converted into very interesting attractions
for tourists.
And now just a few words with respect to
another branch of the discussion. We have
been told about the celebrations that are to
take place this summer in honour of Jacques
Cartier and other early discoverers. May I
remind honourable members, and possibly a
larger audience as well, that English-speaking
Canada is largely indebted for its knowledge
of Jacques Cartier and his discoveries to an
Irishman, Hon. Thomas D'Arcy McGee. Fifty
or sixty years ago, perhaps farther back, the
textbooks in the English schools of this
country contained D'Arcy McGee's poem on
Jacques Cartier, and I venture to say that for
years all that most of the people who passed
through those schools knew about Cartier was
what they derived from that poem. With
the permission of the House I will read a
few verses, which I have no doubt will revive
pleasant boyhood memories in the minds of
some honourable members.
In the seaport of Saint Malo, 'twas a smiling
morn, in May,
When the Commodore Jacques Cartier to the
westward sail'd away;
In the crowded old cathedral all the town
were on their knees,
For the safe return of kinsmen from the
undiscover'd seas;
And every autumn blast that swept o'er
pinnacle and pier,
Fill'd manly hearts with sorrow and gentle
hearts with fear.
Next he goes on to describe the anxiety
that prevailed when no word came from the
daring mariner. And then his return:
And when two monthe were over and added
to the year
Saint Malo hail'd him home again, cheer
answering to cheer.
. he told how soon is cast
in early spring the fetters that hold the
waters fast;
How the winter causeway, broken, is drifted

out to sea,

And the rills and rivers sing with pride the

anthemn of the free;
How the magic wand of summer clad the
landacape, to his eyee,
Like the dry bonee of the just, when they
wake in Paradise.
He told -them of the river whose mighty
current gave
Its freshness, for a hundred leagues, to
Ocean's briny wave;
He told them of the glorious scene presented
to his sight,
What time he rear'd the cross and crown on
Hochelaga's height,
And of the fortrees cliff that keepa of Canada
the key,
And they welcomed back Jacques Cartier
from his perils o'er the sea.

SENATE

308

Honourable senators, I trust that the committee in charge of the approaching celebration, as well as the orators who are to appear
on different occasions, will not forget that
poem when they are polishing up their
perorations.

section 3 as bearing on the point. I thought
he accepted my suggestion, and that the words
"the Governor in Couneil may from time to
time make regulations" would be inserted in
both section 3 and section 37. This would
make the regulations subject to the Governor
in Council rather than to a ministerial order.

FRUIT AND HONEY BILL

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I am sorry
if I misunderstood my honourable friend, but
I had in mind only the penalty regulations
in k on page 3 and k on page 9. The Chairman of the Committee tells me he had the
same thought. I had no idea that the honourable member wanted the Governor in
Council to pass on all the other regulations.
True, the powers are somewhat extended, but
they are mainly a re-enactment of the powers
in the old Act. I should think it would be
unnecessary to have the Governor in Council
pass on all these detail regulations. Certainly
the Governor in Council cannot know anything about them. The Minister has no power
to control importations. He has power to
license commission agents and dealers in Canada and to control their operations; but that
is all. I do not think this is such a serious
extension of power as to warrant us in having
these regulations go before the Governor in
Council. At least, I should not like to accept
the suggestion without consulting further with
the Committee on Agriculture and the representative of the department.

FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 26, an Act respecting Fruit and Honey.Right Hon. Mr. Meighen.
Hon. Mr. McLennan in the Chair.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, most of the sections were agreed to
when this Bill was previously in Committee.
I will now refer to the subjects that were
left for further consideration. By subsection k
of section 3 the Minister was given power to
prescribe maximum and minimum punishment
for the violation of certain regulations, the
maximum fine not to exceed two hundred
dollars and imprisonment not to exceed one
month for default in payment of the fine.
A similar provision respecting punishment for
violation of regulations governing honey was
contained in subsection k of section 37.
The use of the word "export" was also
reserved. In the original Bill the word was
defined as "a shipment of honey from the
province in which it is produced to any other
Honourable
province or out of Canada."
senators do not like the word as applied to
interprovincial shipments.
A further reservation was whether, as in
section 34, absolute discretion should be given
the Minister "to prescribe the conditions
respecting applications for and the issue of
licences, the duration of same and the fees
to be paid therefor."
This morning the Standing Committee on
Agriculture and Forestry met informally and
reviewed very carefully all the subjects
reserved. As the result of its deliberations I
have several amendments to present. First,
I move:
That section 3, paragraph k, page 3, line 1,
be amended by inserting after the word
"prescribe" the words "subject to approval of
the Governor in Council."
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I misunderstood the
right honourable gentleman in the Standing
Committee. There I suggested that the words
"subject to the approval of the Governor in
Council" should apply ta the regulations
generally, not to the one clause. I made the
suggestion because of the powers being wider
than those in the Fruit Act, which is being
repealed by this Bill. I cited paragraph h of
Hon. Mr. MURPHY.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
The old Act empowered the Governor in Couneil to make
regulations with respect to the importation of
fruit. Under paragraph h of section 3 of this
Bill the Minister may make regulations:
ta provide that all or any kind of imported
fruit or fruit pack-ages shall be subiect to certain or all regulations made under this Act
and in the case of any kind of inported fruit
to make regulations in respect thereof as if
such fruit had been grown in Canada.
Under this power, if the Minister wished to
prohibit entry of fruit, he might make regulations with which the importers could not
comply.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
He could
only prohibit its sale in the country.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
In regard to the
much wider powers given the Minister in
respect of imports I thought they should be
exercised by the Governor in Council rather
than by a ministerial order.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: May I point
out to the honourable senator-he, having
been a member of the former Government,
will realize its importance-that in respect
of the importation -of seasonal fruit regula-

APRIL 25, 1934
tions may have to be made pretty quickly.
The details are known to the Minister and to
lis officers. Very often if something has to
be suhmitted to Council no action will be
taken on it because one rnember wishes to
be present or another isnot present, and it is
deferred from day to day until the Minister's
patience is exhausted and maybe considerable
harm has been done, when the fact is that
the only man around the Council Board who
knows anything about the matter is the Minister hjmself. Very of'ten there is 'necessity
for prompt action with respect 'toeguain
affecting fruit.
The amendment was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Next I move:
That sections 36, 37, 38, 30, 40, 41 and 42
and the -titie of part Ill be amnended by inserting afteT the word "export" wherever it
appears therein the words "and interprovincial
trade.",
The amendment was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGILEN: Then I move:
That section 37 k, page 9, line 44, be amended
by inserting after the word "presceribe" the
wards "subject Vo the approval of the Go-vernor
in Council.."

It was thought this would best meet the point
raised by the honourable senator from Queen's
(Hon. Mr. Sinclair).
With respect Vo fees for licences, the Ceinmittee felt it weuld be necessary te leave
this matter to the Minister. Mr. McIntosh,
of :the Department of Agriculture, was present
and gave reasons therefor.
The amendment was agreed te.
On -section 30--definitions:
Hon. Mr. MUTRDOCK: I would call the
attention cf the right lionourable leader cf
the House to the fact that last Thursday
whein section 30 was under consideration hie
said:
1 suggest that we let this clause stand. I do
net understand it.

As a result the section was allowed te stand.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I understand
it now. I brought it before the Standing
Committee to-day, when the honourabIe
member was present. I could not undjerstand
why " dealer " should- be d-efined as:
any person who deala in fruit or vegetabIes
te the amount of- five carloads or the equ1alet
in any calendar year, but if a retai dealer,
Vo the amount cf ten carloads or the equivnieait
in any calendar year.
This morning Mr. MoIntesh explained to the
satisfaction of the Committee that a man
who hanffled up te five carloads sbould be
considered a wholesale deaier and se regu-

0

lated. The diepartment did nlot want to
interfere with the ordinary retailer, but only
with the chain store retailer, and a person
would be one if lie needed ten carloade.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I stili maintain that
Vhs wording will not prevent the doing of
certain Vhings that were done in British
Columbia

and the

Prairie Provinces

about

ten years ago. Personally I think paragrapli
e of section 30 should be amended by ineerting after the word "who" in the 16Vh line these
four words, "personally or in partnership."
This morning before the Committee 1 mentioned that I feared there miglit be a repetitien of what happencd in years gene hy. In
the State of Washington after the fruit season
bas passed its peak there is usually a surplus
Vo be dispesed of. In the past it was the
practice te send this surplus fruit f orward at
very much less than cost. The shippers had a
list cf ail the retail dealers in the Vowns and
cities cf the Western Provinces, te any of
whom they would send a carload. Should
they attempt te do that again, it seems te me
that they miglit evade the provisions cf the
Bill. I still Vhink this particular section is
faulty, but I shahl net press my objection to
it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Apparently
the honourable senator bas net noted the
definition of "persen" in the interpretation
cbiuse on the first page of the Bill:
"ýperson" means both the singular and plural,
individuals. partnershi-ps, companies, cerporations, societies and associations and their
agonts or employees.
Therefore section 30 includes partnerships
and lias the samne effeet as if the honourable
member's proposed amendment were adopted.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.- Would not the
possibility mentioned by the honourable
gentleman frem Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) be controlied by tariff regulation with
respect te Vlie importation cf fruit?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MFJGHEN: I think se,
but I was net sure this merning. The honourable senator from Parkdale bas in mind that
in tlie latter part cf the season fruit growers
in the State of Washington will ship fruit cf
a quality that can net pass inspection, but
that it will net be supervised, as those shippers
wiil send a car te one retailer, a second car te
another retailer, and se on, because the retailer is 'net licensed.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: But the shippers
in the State of Washington could net dump
fruit into Canada.

SENATE

310

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The dumping clause would come into play anyway. We
are talking rather of supervision, which is
what the lionourable senator from Parkdale
has in mind. He says those shippers will ship
their fruit without inspection, because they
will send a carload te a retailer who does net
buy ten carloads and therefore does not need
a licence. They will net sell te a wholesaler.
Mr. McIntosh's answer is that those exporters
in the States sell not te a retailer, but te a
commission man or a wholesaler, who must
be licensed. That is the only answer I can
give to the substance of the honourable
senator's objection. But I would again point
out te him that the word "person" is so
defined as te be compreiensive enough te
make the section just the same as it would
be were his proposed amendment adopted.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Under the Bill
officials have power to apply the regulations
in regard to grading of fruit te any quantity,
no matter how small, whether it is sent to a
retailer or not.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How do they
get hold of it uniless througli the licensing
system?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: They get it at the
eustoms. The only question would bc whether
it was coming in at a price lower than cost.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
be dumping.
Section 30 was agreed te.
The preamble and the title were agreed te.
The Bill was reported, as amended.

moved

the

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemet - lave followed as closely as I
could the argument of the honourable senator
from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) concerning
the regulations under Part I. I find that
under the prescnt law, as contained in
Chapter 80, these regulations were made by
statute.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The regulatiens would net be made by statute; they
would be authorized by statute.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The grades are
indicated. Subsection 4 of section 3 says:
The Minister, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, may prescribe additional
grades for individual kinds of fruit; preseribe
the kinds of fruit to which grades defined under
this subsection shall apply, and make such regulations as may be necessary for making effective
the provisions of this section.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

Then there is the marking. All is done either
by the Act or by the Governor in Couneil.
Under this Bill the regulations can be made
only by the Minister. Of course, as my right
honourable friend has said, there are instances
in which the Minister must act promptly.
But attention bas been drawn to paragraplis
h and i, which read:
-(h)
to provide that all or any kind of
imported fruit or fruit packages shall bc subject te certain or all regulations mtade under
this Act and in the case of auy kind of
imported fruit to make regulations in respect
thereof as if such fruit had been grown in
Canada;
(i) to prescribe the conditions respecting
applications for and the issue of registration
certificates, the duration of same and the fee
to bc paid therefor.
The point is well taken, I tlhink, that if
those regulations allow the Minister practically
to substitute himself for the Governor in
Council and Parliament in dealing witli the
tariff, so to speak, and in impeding the movement of fruit from outside into Canala, the
responsibility should lie on the Governor in
Council. There is danger that the Miniter
may be actuated by a certain angle of the
argument presented. The Governor in Council
looks at things from all angles, with a view
to protecting net only the Canadian producer,
but also the consumer. May there not be
some virtue in the claim of the hionourable
senator from Quecen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) that
these regulations should be approved by the
Governor in Couneil? There iN considerable
power delegated by Parliament to the Go ernor in Council, and then, under this regulatien, from the Governor in Council to the
Minister. I wonder if it would not provide a
safeguard to have these regulations submitted
to the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
While the honourable senator from Queen's is justified in
raising his point, I should like to say a word
about the difference of opinion in committee
this morning. When we were discussing this
Bill a week ago I understood the honourable
gentleman te be raising objection to the
Minister having power to fix maximum and
minimum penalties. Wlien I asked the department to send a man to explain the Bill,
that was the point I had in view, and the
amendment by the committee was along the
line of penalties only.
I sec the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
point raised by my honourable friend. The
principal objection to giving the Minister
power te make the regulations is that he may
make special regulations by virtue of paragraph h, which says:

APRIL 25, 1934
-to provide that ail or any kind of impartedl
fruit or fruit -packages @hall hea ub ect to
certain or ail regulations madle under this Act
and in the case of any kind of imported fruit
to make regulations iu respect thereof as if
such fruit had been grown in Canada.
Very good. But that does not give hîm, control of importations. Ail he eau do is to
apply to imported fruit the regulations which,
by virtue of any other clauses here, ha can
make as affecting Canadian grown fruit. He
cannot stop importation.
I am in the hauds of the flouse as ta
whether the Minister should submit these
regulations to the Governor in Council. If
they were continuing regulations, undoubtedly
he should. In a sense they are continuing,
but sometimes they have ta be altered pretty
rapidly. That is all I can say in support of
the Minister's doing this himseif. If it i.s the
general feeling of the flouse that the regulations should be made by the Governor in
Council, I shaîl not press the resistance any
further.
Hon. Mr. SINGLAIR: I feel that the point
made by the right honourable gentleman as
to the speedy changing of the regulations is
perhaps not as important as he may at the
moment think. The present law bas been in
force for about thirty years, and the regulations in.regard ta the standard of grade and
the size and description of the package, which
are now being lef t ta the discretion of the
Minister, were set out in the statute, and they
have beau amended from, time ta time ta suit
conditions. ýUp ta now the law bas worked
very well. No instance was given ta the
Cammittee by the Fruit Commissioner of any
embarrassment being caused ta those wbo were
administering the Act; and when we look back
over its history and find that it bas worked
well-I have had personal contact with itI do not think we shauld be hasty in giving
such wide powers ta ministerial order. I think
that the regulations ýat the least should be
subjeet ta the Governor in Gouncil. That
is the point that I have been trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, ta make from, the
beginning. That is what I had in mmnd
befora the Committea ou Agriculture wben
I suggested that I would not press the point
strougly an paragraph k, as it would meet the
situation, in part at least, ta maka the regulations subject to the approval of the Govarnor in Council.
I niay say furthar that in a general way
1 feel thara is rather tao great a tendency on
the part of Parliament to confer powars on
ministerial order. It would neot ha sa bad

311

in the case of minor regulations. But this is
merely a skeieton Bill; the pith is in the regulations. This is true also of some other bis
that have been before us or that may came
before us.
It saams to me that the Senate, as a
reviewiug body, might very well take the
ground that important regulations in a Bill of
this kind sh-ould be safeguarded by being
madle sub-ject ta Order in Council instaad
of ta ministerial order. The Department Of
Agriculture is one of the mast efficient in the
service, and is doing good work; but the
whole viewpoint of the department is ta
see that the producer is pratected in every
way possible. That 'being so, it may go
further tha-n it is justified in going, aud I
thiuk that as a safeguard those regulations
should 'ha passed upon by the Governor in
Council, representing every viewpoint in the
country. These are the reasons why I pressed
this matter before the Commnittee an Agriculture, and again urge it here.
Rigbt Hou. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, if
that is the desire of the Cammittee, I suggest
that the honourable senator move that the
Bill be not now read a third time, but be
amended by inserting after the word "Minister " in the first line of clause 3, the word-s
"9wit-h the approval of the Governor in
Council."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: "Sixbject ta
the approval of the Governor in Council."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: "Subject ta
the approval of the Governor in Council."
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR- Would it not serve
the same purpose ta say, "The Govarnor in
Council shall "?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; I do
nat think that is the way it is usually clone.
I had thought of that, but the Minister bas
to make a report.
There are threa 'places where thasa words
will have ta ha inserted: in the first lines
of clauses 3, 34 and 37. Then in the first lines
of paragraph k of section 3 and paragraph
k of section 37, the words " subj et to the
approval of the Governor in Council"' will
have ta be stricken out.
The proposed ameudmeut was agreed ta.
The motion for the third reading of the Bill
ýwas agreed ta, and the Bill was read the

THE TOURIST TRADE
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved:
That a special committee of six senators be
appointed to consider the immense possibilities
of the tourist traffic, to inquire as to the means
adopted by the Government looking to its
encouragement and expansion, and to report to
this House; and that the members of the said
committee be Hon. Senators Dennis, Buchanan,
Foster, Parent, Green and Hocken.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: With a committee of
only six members it is barely possible that
those provinces which necessarily are not
represented may feel aggrieved.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I always think
committees can be too large, and six is a
pretty convenient number. On the committee
is a representative for each of the provinces
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec,
Ontario and British Columbia and I am sure
that the honourable senator from Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) is well qualified to
represent the Prairie Provinces, their conditions being much alike.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

The Senate resumed from April 24 consideration of the motion for the third reading
of Bill F, an Act to amend the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
when moving the third reading of this Bill
last Tuesday the right honourable leader of
the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) referred to the fact that it had been before the
Banking and Commerce Committee for some
eight weeks. As a member of that Committee I desire to express my appreciation of
the diligence and patience of the chairman
(Hon. Mr. Black) and the splendid assistance
given us by the right honourable leader himself.
This is a very important measure, in that
it seeks three objectives in connection with
the business of insurance: first, to give the
business stability; secondly, to ensure security
to policyholders; thirdly, to be invulnerable to
attack on constitutional grounds. Having in
mind the litigation before the Privy Council
in 1924 and 1931, I appreciate the importance
of this legislation, and if the objectives can
be attained without sacrificing the interests
of any of those now engaged in the insurance
business, a grave responsibility rests on any
one who may offer objection to the Bill.
My main objection is to the words in section 118, "other than a member of Lloyd's."
My objection is shared not only by other
members of the Senate, but also by many
persons outside, as is demonstrated by the
fact that we have received a large number
of letters and telegrams from various parts
of the country protesting against the inclusion
of these words. The representations, at least
those which I have received, come mainly
from the 25,000 agents of insurance companies
doing business throughout the Dominion,
many of them under licence issued by the
different provincial authorities. It is claimed
that there are about 250,000 persons dependent on the work of these agents. Naturally
they are watching the progress of this legislation with a great deal of interest.
The British and Canadian companies which
are represented by these agents have large
financial interests in this country; in fact I

APRIL 26, 1934
arn told. they have in deposits with the Goverument of Canada about $400,000,000. They
dlaim to spend very large amounts of money
in various parts of the country, not only in
the form of remuneration to their agents, but
also in the form of rentais and other general
expenses which are esential ta the carrying
oni of such an important business. It is flot
necessary for me ta go into detail in regard
to these expenses. I presume, however, that
there is included in the total a very considerable sum for legal fees--an item which
may be of interest to some honourable gentlemen in this House--quite apart from what
they may have had to pay in order ta have
their case placed fairly and squarely before
the Senate Committee.
The securities which these companies have
deposited with the Government have been
purchased Iargely from the Government of
Canada, the governments of the various provinces, and the municipalities. I think honourable gentlemen wîll realize that from time to
time these companies have assisted very
materially in taking up bond issues of the
provinces and the Dominion. This is something that I think should be borne in mind
when we are considering legisiation affecting
their interests; and when we receive protests
of the nature of those that have been addressed
to honourable members, it is only fair and
right that we sbould pay some heed to them.
I may say that one communication I received bore the names of some fifteen firms
and individuals who act as agents for insurance companies in the province of New
Bruinswick. They represent a very substantial
interest in that province. Many of the
businesqes have been carried on for perhaps
a hundred years, and are being conducted now
by men whose fathers and grandfathers before
themi established the agencies. These people
have a great stake in the community; they
are part of its business life. It is therefore
reasonable that I should not close my eyes
ta the representations contained in their letters
and telegrams, but should endeavour ta present their views. The people who have made
these representations feel that their companies
should not he compelled ta compete with a
group carrying on business under the naine of
Lloyd's unless they can do so on a fair and
equitable basis. That really is the foundation
of their protests.
Our legisiation ought ta be fair ta ail concerned. -It is flot fair in principle ta compel
any group or corporation ta carry on business
under restrictions which are not impoeed upon
every other group or corporation conducting
exactly the saine kind of business. I feel that

313

the principle involved in this Bill is not one
that we should follow. It is hardly fair that
these important companies ta which I have
alluded should be cornpelled, ini order ta carry
on business and have the confidence of the
public, ta put up large surns of money or
make substantial depoeits for the security of
their policyholders while another group of
indîviduals or another firrn or corporation can
corne inta the country and do exactly the
samne kind of business without bei-ng suhject
ta similar obligations.
As honourable members know, a system. has
been established for the collection of taxes
from the British and Canadian companies
operatîng under aur laws. They pay large
sums of rnoney inta the exchequer of the
Dominion and the provinces by way of taxes.
I amn informed that their taxes amaunt ta,
sornething like $3,000,000. Theref are, unless
Lloyd's are compelled ta pay an equitable
share of taxes they should nat be allowed ta
carry on their operations in this country. The
protesta which have been made should receive
some consideration at the hands of this House.
It does seem unfaîr that these old line companies should be compelled ta pay their full
measure of- taxes while this group called
Ll'oyd's, hiaving no office in Canada, escape
because there ia no means of checking up oni
any returns they might send in. As a matter
of fact they would send in fia returns. Under
aur law as it affects Lloyd's, those who pay
premiuma are supposed ta pay the tax ta
Honourable
the Dominion Govemment.
members can readily see that whereas people
who take out policies in sny one of the line
companies are compelled ta pay a tax, it ia
practically left ta the volition of the persan
who masures with Lloyd's whetber he is taxed
or flot.
Most honourable members are no doubt
aware that a policy issued by Lloydsa is signed
by a number of individuals, perhaps one
hundred or more, who guarantee that in the
event of bass they will pay a certain proportion of the value of the property insured. I
amn not attempting ta create the impression
that a Lloyd's policy is not as sound as one
issued by any of the line companies which
make their deposits here as a guarantee of
payaient of lasses.
Suppose that some persan in Canada desired
ta inaure hia property with Lloyd's. If hie
application were accepted hie would in due
time receive hie policy and send on his cheque
for the amount of the premium. Although
that premiurn is liable ta taxation by the
treasury of Canada, there is no system foi
checking the issuance of -such policies; there.
fore no one but the insured need know whether

SENATE
he pays the tax or nlot. Perbaps wbien he gets
his policy lie puts it into a safety deposit
box and forgets ai! about the tax. Therefore
every one of these Lloyd's policies is a ioophiole througbi which the Government may lose
revenue that it should coilect. Thc oniy way
of ensuring the collection of the tax, as now
imposed under the Special War Revenue Act
or the Income Tax Act, wouid bc tbirough the
establishïment of an offiýce to which these insurance transactions would bc reported.
As a laymnan 1 inquire why the Bill grants
any speciai exemption. One answer is that
Lloyd's is a peculiar organization. It is flot
a corporation, company, indu iduai, nor firm,
but a group of individuials. Groups seem to
be popular tbese days. The persons comprising Lloyd's no doubt operate in a way
wbicb best suits tiemnseives for the purpose
of profit. If on account of thoir peculiar
metbod of operation thev cannot, comply with
the laws we make for the regulation of insurance business in tbis couintr.N, tbecY sbiouid
seek other filds. It is contended thtat bccause
of the way Lloyd's is con,tituted thiq couîntry
cannot demand that, tbcy make a dcposit
bere, as ail other instirance companies do,
by way of guarantee for pa,,yment of losses.
But I tbink it bias boen estabiiled that a
deposit, was made in the State of Illinois for
tbe qe(iritv of Jioyd s pohielitolders there.
It is probably true, .,
wva sail. that tle
depo,,it m-as made not 1)'

by some private parties. Whateve te souirce
ci
of tbe deposit, wvesboffd bave in Ibis country
soýme machinery for making certain that
Canadians who insure in Lloyd's receive ahl
tbe security tirat our haw contemplates.
Another reazon that bas been put forxvard
for the inclusion of the words "other than a
memýber of Lloyd's" is that in this form the
legisiation is icas iikehy to be attacked in the
courts. It serms to me that this argument, is
not a soun(i one. I cao lîardiy bring myseif
to believe tbiat thesc words wouhd stand io
the way of anyone who wisbes to test the
iegahity of tbe statute, or that if the legality
were tested they wouhld ensurre the success of
the Dominion 's case. The ingenuity of the
legal fraternity of Canada is weli known, and
anyone desiring to attack the. legisiation wouid
fnd no lack of iawvvers wiliing to accept the
brief.
Why should we grant special exemption
to the Lloyd's group to do business in this
country in opposition to the line companies
îvho are compiying with our iaw? Lloyd's
pay no taxes in this country to help us in
our time of need. They bave no office, pay
no rent, empioy no people.
Hon. Mr. EOSTER.

I uoderstand that this proposed kegisiation
is nt a Government measure, but an ordinary
publie Bill. Io some parts of tbe country I
amn iooked uipon as being shightiy partisan, but
cver since 1 became a, member of this bouse
I have' hn,'n inclined to give support to Govcrom-ent iegislation, for I realize that the Admnioisration takes responsibility for ail the
mcasurc.s it submit.s and endeavours to act
in the best interests of the country. As this
is flot a Government mea.sure, I feel that we
sbould judge it entireiy on its merits.
Believing that ire shotild flot pass leýgisiatien which wxould have the effeet of discriminating against ail the line companies operating
in this country, 1 mnove, seeonded by the
lionourable .senator from Montarville (Hon.

One

the Coînittee
on Banking and Commrerce represented no
fewer than 227 conipanies, ail of which are
opposed to this Bill as it now stands-. Among
them are ýsoiîîe of the most solvent institutions in this country. Such coneîns as the
Royal Insurance Companly, the Liverpool,
London and ýGlobe Insýurance Company, and
many others whose headquarters are in Great
Britaisi, have been, establishied for a long
period of years ini this Dominion. They have
real estate and other valuable assets bere.
Yet snch companies would bo discriminat-ed
against by the Bihl. Regardless of their finar.cial strengtb and the value of their investinents in tbis eountry, ail ifisurance comprîmes operating in Canada, with une exception,
are subjecteci to certain conditions that are
considereci as essential for the protection of
the intercsts of policybolders. That exception
is Lloyd's, whicb bias no office in tbis country, but does its business across the ocean,
in England, where it is not subject to the
requirements of our law.
Honourable members will agi-ce witb me
tbaýt the exemption contains no evidence of
tbat equality of justice wivhih should exist

APRIL 26, 1934
in our law-making bodies. Certainly there is
no occasion for surprise at the protestations
which have been made by the thousand al
over the country. It was stated in the cernmittee that every member had been deluged
with correspondence and telegrams expressing
opposition to this discrimination in favour
of Lloyd's.
There must be a reason for such an unusual
.egislative exemption. 1 freely admit that
the intentions behind the reason are undoubtedly good. But what is the reason?
So far our insurance legisiation has fared
badly. On three occasions the Privy Council,
declaring that Parliament had overstepped its
lurisdietion, annulled the enactmnent. Now a
last determined effort is being made te base
our legisiation on such solid ground that it
cannot be assailed in the courts on the plea
of unconstitutionality. As I have said, similar
legisiation in the past has been successfully
attacked before the Privy Council, and I
appreciate how essential it is to endeavour
to render the present Bill unassailable.
Let us examine the means adepted to bring
this about. An eminent lawyer, whom I
deeply respect, appeared before the Committee
on Banking and Commerce and expressed himself to this effe et: Be careful! The Privy
Council is suspicious; it is disposed to think
that under the guise of certain clauses of the
Constitution. partieularly with respect to
bankruptcy, the Parliament of Canada will
attempt to ove'rstep its juriadietion and controt the administration of insurance. Apparently that is what we are doing. Evidently
we desire to protect our policyholders against
bankruptcy or insolvency of any insurance
company. But what meana are we adopting
te attain this end?
Let us go a step further. How do those
behind this measure intend te dispel the
suspicion lurking in the minds of the law
lords? Sîmply by excepting Lloyd's from its
The members of the Privy
provisions.
Council are the eJilest and most painstaking
judges in the world, and their judgments are
aceepted without question throughout the
British Empire. Let us imagine that this
measure has been enacted and is being
attacked as ultra vires of this Parliament.
Counsel would argue that the Act ia nothing
but a usurpation of the jurisdiction of the
provinces; that the Federal Government,
under the pretense of controlling insurance
companies with respect to insolvency, has
sought to supervise the business of insurance
in aIl its phases. Naturally the law lords
would test the validity of the legisîntion by
ascertaining whether it comnes within the
federal purview. If it could not be sustained

by virtue of the British North America Act,
the Privy Council would rule it to be unconstitutional and void.
But, honourable members, how is it proposed to guard against the possibility of such
an adverse judgment? Every mnsuranee company "offher than a member of Lloyd's" is
required to deposit security with the Gevernment. Lloyd's are utterly solvent. It is the
hope that should the constitutionality of the
legislation be called in question the law lords
would proceed to deal with the case, not on
the basis of the Constitution, but on the
quality of the cemplainant. We are told that
but for the words "other than a member of
Lloyd's" the Privy Council would say: "Why,
Lloyd's are absolutely solvent. Undoubtedly
the legislation is ultra vires." By this exception in favour of Lloyd's, although the Parliament of iCanada had overstepped its jurisdiction, it would presumably be justified on
the ground that it was seeking to deal with
eolvency and bankruptcy in relation to insurance companies.
That reasoning, I submit, will not appeal
te the bouse. The legisiation cannet be
deelared te be good because those who question it are insolvent; and it cannot be declared te be bad because those who object to
it are solvent. Let us suppose that Lloyd's
accept the measure, but that the Liverpool,
London and Globe Insurance Company objeet
to it and appear before the Privy Council
saying: "Look at ail the real estate we own
in Canada and the deposits we have made
with the Department of Insurance. These
are amply sufficient te guarantee our policyholders againat any possibility of loas." I
submit the company could make out an unassailable case for its utter solvency. This
being se, why should not the Liverpool,
London and Globe Insurance Company be
placed on the same footing as Lloyd's? For
my part I cannot see any legal justification
for enacting legialatien that is cither constitutional or unconstitutional accerding te
the quality of those who may question its
constitutionality. A law is good or it is bad
with respect to everybody.
By what right do we ask insurance companies which have made heavy investments
in tliis country ini order te carry on business
te submit te certain conditions which we
consider essential te the protection of their
policyholders, while we exempt an organizatien, respectable if you like, but with no
assets here, which makes its centract across
the water, has an organîzation which pays no
taxes, provincial or federal, and is making a
predatory fight, se te speak, against 1egirtimate insurance cempanies? That is what

316

SENATE

Lloyd's are doing now. There is a eutthroat competition in progress between them
and the legitirnate insurance companies of
Canada.
I ar n ot surprised that thousands of persons are very much concerncd about this
measure. There is nothing so irksome and su
dangerous as a sense of injustice. It bas heen
tbe cause of ail major troubles. Our people
will tolerate nearly everything but injustice:
tbat tbcy w'ill resent and oppose.
Our jurisdiction is hased on the Constitu.,tion. Now we are cxercising that jurisdiction,
without doubt, for the good of the peuple
of Canada, for our Insurance Department is
ably and efficiently conducted. But we must
not ignore the constitutional limitations imposed on Parliarent. Our legisiation rnust
always respond te, this test: Does it corne
w'ithin our jurisdiction under the Constitution? If it fails to meet this test, it will
topple over of its own inherent weakness.
May I rernind honourable members that in
the State of Illinois the authorities required
Lloyd's to make a deposit of securities. How
did they do so? By their agents and representatives keeping back the premiurns paid
to them and due to their principals. As a
matter of fact the deposit w-as made, but not
hy Lloyd's directly. Why sqhould not the
isarne course ho followed in tlîis country?
I hope the arnendrnent will be accept.ed in
the narne of soun<l legislation and equity and
to rcas-.ure our people that wc desire to deal
fairly by thern.
Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: I arn
sure that those of our number who were not
present at the discussion of this subje-et bcfore the Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce will, after tbe cloquent addresses we
have just beard, tbink that I corne before the
House as the parent of a monsýtrous piece of
legislation.
I do not sekl to minimize the
importance of sorne of the considerations advanced by the bonourahle senator frum Saint
John (Hon. Mr. Foster) and the bonourahle
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). The question is involved and difficuit,
and I do not know that I bave ever risen to
explain a prohlern of greater intricacy, where
I feit the obligation to he clear and lucid
more difficult of diseharge, than in the present
instance.
This buse had tbree insurance measures
hefore it two years ago. One was desîgned
f0 re-estahlish the Insurance Department,
heing in the main merely a copy of the old
provisions; the other, mostly new, though
built upon the old legislation, was to cover
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the subject of foreiga insurance; the third
was a similar Bill covering BriLish and Canadian insurance. Owing to decisions of tbe
higbest court of the realma it bad become
necessary, if we were to continue our Insuranice Departrnent, to bring our legislation
witbin tbe ambit clearly left to us, if indeed
there were any.
We passed those bills. I shahl refer to the
second and third as I proceed with the argument, but I tbink it better 00W to try to
get the House to realize the importance of
the continuation of the Federal Insurance Department. No one could have less sympatby
than I bave with a continual seramble, as
hetween the federal and the provincial authoritics, rnerely for the sake of jurisdiction and
the keeping up of departrnental organîzations.
In fact I wiIs rather inclined to make an end
of the whole thing and leave insurance to
the provinces; but considerations were advanced wbicb cornpelled me to, change that
view, indeed convinced me that it was of
practical importance to -Canada to continue
federal supervision of insurance.
In the flrst place we bave a very efficient
department and a very able superintendent.
This alune would be a rather worthless argument; it is only of value associated with the
other arguments which I shail advance.
Another renson, a very powerful one, is
that if insurance is to be subjeet only to
provincial rcview and supervision, then the
status of a very large array of ýCanadian companies will be so reduced and irnpaired that
their business, not su much in Canada as
abroad, will, they feel, be seriously challenged.
Our companies enjoy by far the greatest part
of ýCanadian if e insurance business-I think,
more than 90 per cent; but they also are in
enjoyrnent of a tremendous business in foreign
lands. Almost 50 per cent of the income of
Canadian life insurance companies cornes
from this source. Outside Canada they bave
until 00W heen able to represent tbernselves
as licensed, supervised and inspected by tbe
federal authorities. In that way tbey irnpressed upon their clientele and those to whomn
tbey appeal for business that tbey have
strengtb and status and are really dependable
companies.
Tbey bave been able, Iargely
because of this very feature, of course supple-

mented by their own efficiency and business
capacity, to make a great success of insurance in the foreigu field. I believe the Flouse,
unless it were irnpelled by a motivation that
seerned to outweigh the importance of tbose
facts, would besitate to do anything that

APRIL 26, 1934
might imperil federal jurisdiction and strike
a blow at a very important section of Canadian business life.
The third reason is this. Only the two
larger provinces, Ontario and Quebecpossibly, for the purpose of argument I
should add British Columbia-have insurance
departments. The other six provinces bave
none, and further, they do not want to eetablish them. In my humble view those six
provinces are to be commended upon the
common sense inherent in their position.
Surely we have enough of duplication, triplication anct multiplication in this country
already. We bave the departments of the
Dominion, Ontario, Quebec and British
Columbia, and ail companies doing Canadian
business have to bear the expense involved
in complying with the requirements of this
array of supervision and inspection bure-aus.
If we are flot able to sustain the Dominion
department, the number of departmnents will
immediately be increased to nine. Honourable members will sec at a glance the fearful
burden that our companies would therelby
be called upon to bear by reason of a
and
of costs
multiplication
grotesque
machinery, already one of the bancs of
Confederation.
I think I1have gone as far as is necessary
to establish the importance of maintaining
federal jurisdiction, if that is possible. I
recaî,l that a littie more than a year ago, at
the Provincial Conference, each of the six
provinces I have referred te, -made pleas to
the Dominion to continue the federal department. 1 do not know the present position
of 'British Columbia, but I should hope tbat
it lias j oined with those six provinces. 0crtainly to those who have a knowledge of the
financial position of our provinces there
would appear to be resns why we should
exercise ail the economy within our power.
Now, if we think it worth while to make
a real effort to maintain a federal depaTtment, our first objective should be a Bill
which is likely to be sustained in the event
of another appeal. Why are we so keen
about resisting a possible challenge to our
jurisietion? The main reason is that already
we have had three serions challenges. The
first was in 1916, when Alerta launched an
appeal i regard to what are known as the
reciprocal insurance organizations. At that
time the Privy Council held against the
Dominion of Canada.
I could give the Heuse, if it would not tend
unduly to complicate the situation, -the pith
of the issue before the Privy Council in 1916.
The question was whether the Dominion had
power to compel a company to take out a

317

federal licence before doing business, or
whether a local licence was sufficient. The
Privy Council held that the local licence was
sufficient, and the federal contention was disallowed on ail grounds.
Canada then, having in mind the desirability of retaining if possible the federal department, set to work to achieve the goal by
other means. Legisiation was passed making
it a criminal cifence for any company to do
business in Canada contrary to the provisions
of the Insurance Acts. There was no question that the Dominion alone had jusisdiction
in criminal law, and apparcntly the Government of the day was adviscd that if it could
keep within that field it could do what it
wanted to do. The provinces in 1924 went to
tbe Privy Council, who declared tbat the
conduct of the business of insurance was a
provincial matter, and furthcr, quite fairlY
and rightly, tbat the Dominion could flot by
the exercise of an undisputed jurisdiction in
criminal matters invade the exclusive domain
of the provinces, and tbat the legislation wbich
had been passed was not really criminal legislation at ail. To use the words of the Judicial
Committee:
Viewed as a whole, it was flot criminal law,
but was merely an attempt under colour of
criminal law to, appropriate to itself a demain
denied te it by the British North America Act.
Then, in 1931, the Dominion attempted to
act under the cloak of taxation. It had previously attempted to act under the cloak of
alienation. Again it failed. Ali tbrougb the
decisions given this reservation was repcated,
that it would be possible for the Dominion
to frame legislation to shut out aliens, or to
control. them after they came in. We did
our best to comne within this limitation in
our revision of the Foreign Insurance Companies Act, but we cannot come witbin it in
our revision of tbe Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act, because a British
company is not an alien. It therefore becomes necessary for us to sec if there is not
some other solid footing upon wbich we can
rest and establish our jurisdiction in relation
to insurance, sufficiently at lest to keep the
federal department reasonably effective. We
bave jurisdiction in bankruptcy and insolvency, and I do not think there is any serions
question as to where that jurisdiction begins
and ends. It has been held in the Delisle case
that the federal powers in bankruptcy and
insolvency go to the extent of enabling the
Federal Parliament to declare where bankruptcies begin, the conditioxis under wbich
the law cornes into operation, and the effect of
that operation. In insurance it bas become

3IS

SENATE

necessarv that those having jurisdiction in
insolvency shall also have power to declare
whcre it begins and ends. Insurance, unlike
a iere commercial operation, is a matter of
acturarial science. A company able to pay
all its dhets on a given day may still be
absolutely insolvent by reason of obligations
to mature later, and it may be necessary in
the public interest to declare it insolvent.
Hence I think it can be conceded that in
regardIo
insurance we have the right to declare who is bankrupt or who is able to demonstraite ilat he is solvent to such a degree as to
warrant his being allowed to conduct the
business.
That is the rock upon which the main
features of this legislation stand, and I think
I have said enough to impress upon the
House the necessity of making sure that we
are hoiestly on that rock and not in the
position in which we were found te be on
two prexious occasions, of pretending to
exercise a jurisdiction that everybody knows
to l'e ours, but only for the purpose of securing anotlier jurisdiction that is held net
to be ours at al]. Therefore we must show
every evidence of good faith in the very
terms and letter of our legislation, and the
jurisdiction we are seeking to exercise must
really be jurisdiction in insolvency. We do
not want to be in a position where it can
be said te us: "We told you that you liad
no jurisdiction in the business of insurance.
Ye tried to get it under alienation, and we
told you to go back. You then came before
lis vith criminal legisiation, and we told you
it was colourable and could net stand. Now
you come pretending to exercise your powers
in bankruptcy, and we give yon the same
answer."
There is no particular fear that
any organization will hale us before the
tribunal; if we are haled there, doubtless it
will be by one of the provinces; but we want
to be able to say to the Privy Council, and
to show by every section of the Act, that
we are honestly on the footing of insolvency
and are not seeking to supervise insurance
beyond the point of seeing that it is solvent.
We do net want it to lie in the mouth of
any province to say: "This is net bona fide.
Here is section so and se; imagine the Parliament of Canada saying that in this special
case, under terms and conditions known to
the world, they have to legislate in insolvency."
Now I come to the Bill itself, but before
procreding to discuss it I want to ask the
House to get the issue clearly into its mind.
From the debate so far one would think that
the issue was, "Shall Lloyd's be allowed to
come into Canada?" or "Shall Lloyd's have
TUglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

to stay out?" With all deference to honourable members, that is not the point at all.
The fact is that Lloyd's are here to-day, and
are doing business in Quebec and in other
provinces, and in the province of Quebec
certain groups of Lloyd's underwriters have
a licence. Whether this legislation passes in
its present form or in the form desired by
the honourable gentleman from Saint John
(Hon. Mr. Foster), Lloyd's will still be doing
business liere. It is truc they will lack the
prestige of having a federal licence, and the

advantages that go with it; but how much
of a handicap that will be nobody can tell.
Lloyd's do not need the prestige of a licence,
or the advantages that go witi it, in the same
way that certain weaker or less known companies do. Personally I do not think there
will be a great deal of difference in the
amuount of business Lloyd's will do, whether
this Act passes in its prosent forin or in the
forre favoured by the honourable gentleman
from Saint John. Admittedly Ontario stands
ready to grant them a licence; other provinces have appealed for provisions which would
enable them to come in.
I may mention
specifically the province of Saskatchewan, and,
although I have not seen the correspondence,
I feel confident that I could add Manitoba
and Alberta.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
wisi this to go through?

They

Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They do net
specify what the legislation should be, but
they wish some door to be opened to admit
Lloyd's.
Is it net strange that this roar that has
resounded throughout Canada, which bas net
been exaggerated at all by the honourable
gentleman from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster)
nor the honourable member from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien), was not raised in the
provincial legislatures? Indeed some of them
-net all-have made special provision for the
admission of Lloyd's. To-day the legislatures
are certain]y in favour of admitting Lloyd's,
and undoubtedly they will welcome this legislation far more warmly if it provides for their
admission.
If there is one point that it is desirable to
keep in mind in reference to our insurance
legislation now, it is the desirability of some
settlement of this issue with the provinces, of
securing legislation which will net be challenged by the provinces as unfair, and under
which they can take their part and work out
their objectives alongside the federal authorities. I go so far as to say that in the Bill
before us we have that legislation; but I think
that if it were to be amended as proposed I

APRIL 26, 1934
should have every reason to fear that it would
be challenged.
Let me finally and definitely emphasize the
fact that the provinces which have borne the
brunt of the fray in the fight for provincial
jurisdiction want some provision whereby
Lloyd's will be enabled to do business in
Canada. So the question is whether there
shall be such a provision, or whether we shall
go on in an attitude of perpetual challenge
and deflance.
If the legislation of this Parliament again
goes to the Privy Council, and is again upset,
I think we may make up our minds that it is
our last journey. There will then be nothing
left upon which we can fall back. Federal
jurisdiction over insurance will be gone, and
our department will have come to an end of
its usefulness. Now, if it is important to maintain that jurisdiction, surely it is worth while
to canvass thoroughly our position and see if
we cannot meet the provinces. Surely it is
worth while to make an earnest attempt to
be done with litigation and defeat in the
courts, and to create a situation wherein our
department will be serving the provincial
departments while they in turn supplement,
if they so desire, the work done under the
authority of federal legislation.
The main ground of attack on this measure
is that it discriminates in favour of Lloyd's
and against Canadian, British and other companies which are required to make deposits
and give security in Canada before they receive a federal licence. In the first place I
want to emphasize that the object of our
insurance legisIation is to protect the interests
of people who purchase insurance. It is essential. that Parliament should exercise parental supervision, for the ordinary insured
person is in no position to judge whether or
not the company to whom he has paid his
premium is fully competent to take care of
its obligation. So the main, if not the whole,
purpose of insurance legislation is protection
for the public. Let us not debate this Bill
as if the question were whether we should
give encouragement to Canadian companies in
preference to their competitors from other
countries--as if we were considering a matter
of protection for Canadian- enterprises. I certainly would not oppose the giving of some
advantage to Canadian companies, even in
the field of insurance, if that principle were
before us for consideration. But I repeat that
the object--so far as I know, the only object
-of this Bill is to see that the public who
purchase insurance are protected.
In the carrying out of this object we must,
to the utmost of our power-I emphasize

319

those six words-take care not to be unfair to
the insured and not to discriminate unnecessarily or unjustly as between companies. Are
we being unfair to Canadian and other companies in this Bill? This question brings us to
the exact terms of the measure. The main
feature is the same as that in the Foreign
Before any
Insurance Companies Bill.
Dominion incorporated company or British
company can obtain a federal licence to
carry on an insurance business it must make
at Ottawa a deposit equal to its premium
reserves, as a security for the payment of its
liabilities. From this provision Lloyd's are
excepted on certain terms, and certainly the
onus is on those who justify the exception to
establish the desirability of the terms. While
I am trying to do so I ask the House to keep
in mind what I said before, that unless we
make some provisions for giving Lloyd's a
federal licence to write business here that
organization will do the business without a
licence. We cannot prevent it from so doing
unless we obtain an injunction, such as we
have hitherto sought in vain.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the right honourable gentleman permit me to ask him a
question? Do I understand that Lloyd's
carry on business throughout Canada?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not say
throughout CanadaHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Wherever
they want to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, wherever
they want to.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: How do they do that?
Do they get licences from the provincial
governments?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They have a
licence in Quebec and they can get one in
Ontario. I believe that at the present time
their Ontario business is done through a
Montreal office. In Saskatchewan Lloyd's
have insured the Hudson Bay route, for
example. They have a licence in Quebec,
and Canadian applications are sent to them
there or at London, the business being actually
written at one of those plates.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Suppose a person
residing in Toronto desired to insure with
Lloyd's. Is there anything in either the
federal or the provincial law to prevent him
from writing to London and purchasing a
policy from Lloyd's?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nothing at
all. That is being done right along. Or
he could write to Montreal and have his

320

SENATE

business completed there. I think I am not
going too far when I say that unless we make
provision for giving Lloyd's a federal licence,
they will obtain one from the government of
each province in whieh they desire to do
business. If we give them a Dominion licence
they will of course be subjected to the same
supervision as ail other insurance companies.
The Bill states that Lloyd's shall not be
required te make the customary deposit, provided they comply with certain other requirements. Before proceeding further I want to
state the reason why an exception is made
in the case of this organization. Lloyd's are
an incorporated society whose business is
actually underwritten by its individual members or groups of members. They are a kind
of world institution, established some two
hundred and fifty years ago, whose home is
in London, alongside of, and in historic
significance not unlike, the Bank of England.
An important fact is that there are special
British statutes applicable to Lloyd's alone.
Recognizing the international character of the
organization, wbieh bas liabilities throughout
the length and breadth of the world, and
recognizing also how closely the reputation of
Britain is linked with the solidity and dependability of this unique society, these
statutes provide special guarantees te cover
the member's liabilities in every country. In
the first place, ail the premiums received for
any underwriter in any year have to go into
a trust fund, which is maintained under the
supervision of the English Board of Trade as
security for payment of losses incurred by
that underwriter. This fund alone aniounts
to more than the premium reserve which is
required at Ottawa as a deposit by other
companies. In the second place, each underwriter in Lloyd's bas to establish a guarantee
fund of deposits or guarantees acceptable to
the Government of Great Britain and equal
to the premium income of the preceding yenr.
This fund is likewise under the supervision of
the British Board of Trade, and, like the one
I first mentioned, it amounts to more than
the deposit required of other insurance companies doing business in Canada. Additional
deposits, to which I need not refer, are required under the Imperial legislation. It is
estimated by officials-not of the Government
of Canada, for I have no figures from them
in this regard, but of another Governmentthat the ratio of the value of these securities
to liabilities is from four to five times in
excess of the Canadian security requirements.
This Imperial legislation is so framed that
the securities I have mentioned are applicable
with respect to the liabilities ineurred by
Lloyd's underwriters in every quarter of the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

world. I know of no other British law containing a similar provision with respect to insurance. In the face of that statute, which
has existed in its present form since 1909
and was in a similar form long years before
that, it would be very difficult for counsel
supporting our federal legislation to argue
successfully before the Privy Couneil that we
find it necessary to require from Lloyd's a
deposit in Canada in addition to those funds
held in England. Should counsel make such
an argument-and there is no doubt we shall
have to defend our position in the courts if
the honourable gentleman's amendment is
adopted-is counsel not likely to be told
pretty quickly, "You are simply repeating the
performance of 1916, 1924 and 1931"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But would not
the point at issue before the Privy Couneil
be limited to the rigit of this Parliament to
impose on Lloyd's the obligation of making
a deposit?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
so.

It

may be

Privy Couneil go further than to consider the

principle involved?
matter of the amount of the deposit?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it is
inevitable that if we appear again before the
Privy Council with respect to our insurance
legislation it will be at the instance of one
of the provinces.
And that province may
have Lloyd's standing in the same relation
to it as the Factory Mutuals stood to a
province in 1931. This time we should be on
an entirely new footing. Our argument would
be this: "We stand before you with our
feet firmly planted on the solid rock of our
jurisdiction in bankruptey. We defend this
legislation by virtue of our authority to declare when an institution is or is not bankrupt, and wiat results shall follow from bankruptcy. You bave beld in the Delisle case
tha,t we can declare when bankruptcy begins.
We are simply taking precautions to see that
it does not begin, so far as insurance companies are concerned. If we cannot do this
no one else can, for in Canada we alone
have jurisdiction in bankruptcy."
And the
reply would probably be: "Show us that this
part of your legislation which requires the
deposits is essential to the exercise of your
jurisdiction in bankruptcy." The court might
ask, "Do you think you need a deposit from
the London and Lancashire Company?" We
should prohably answer, "The London and
Lancashire is a very powerful company, which

APRIL 26, 1934
we know has tremendous assets in England,
but without such legislation as we are now
defending we should have no means of applying those assets as securities for losses incurred in Canada; so we require that company to provide security in the shape of a
deposit."
I think we should be correct in contending
that it is the right and duty of the Federal
Parliament to provide, under its jurisdiction
in bankruptey, that every insurance company,
however strong, deposit securities as a guarantee of ability to meet its liabilities; and we
could make that argument with respect to
the London and Lancashire Company, for
example. But if we attempted to apply it to
Lloyd's, the law lords would probably say,
"You have the same right of access that the
people of England have to the special guarantee funds that Lloyd's maintain. Because
you fear bankruptcy, do you think it is
necessary to require deposits in Canada by
Lloyd's, and thus to build the structure of
their security to six or seven times the height
that your legislation regards as safe?" I
fear that if we replied in the affirmative we
should be standing on a pretty narrow path
and in danger of being brushed aside. It is
only that we might the more clearly show
our bona fides if we had to appear again before that great tribunal that I think we should
retain the exception with respect to Lloyd's
in the Bill.
An honourable gentleman says that Lloyd's
can put up a deposit in Canada, as all other
companies do. In reply to that argument I
make the observation that Great Britain
found it necessary to have special provisions
applicable to Lloyd's, because of the nature
of their organization. For the same reason
certain provinces of Canada, one after the
other, found it necessary to have special provisions with respect to Lloyd's. I go further
and state that this Parliament found it necessary, when dealing with the Foreign Insurance
Companies Act, to have special provisions
with respect to Factory Mutuals. The Factory Mutuals in relation to the Foreign
Insurance Companies Act stand on all fours
with Lloyd's in relation .to the present Bill.
We found that we could not put the Factory
Mutuals into the same mould as the corporate companies; so we had to make special
provision. And if my memory serves me
right that special provision passed this House
with the support of the honourable senator
from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster).
Hon. Mr. BLACK: And also with the
support of the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).

321

Right Hon. Mr. ýMEIGHEN: Yes, I think
that is so. The organization of Lloyd's is
unique. Lloyd's did not put up a deposit in
Illinois; it was Lloyd's brokers who did that.
They owe that money to Lloyd's. But the
State of Illinois is not subject to the law
of Canada or to the jurisdiction of the Privy
Council. If Illinois wants to shut out Lloyd's
there are no states nor principalities nor
powers there to let them in again.
I want to emphasize that if the Bill passes,
Lloyd's must get a licence. Then their policyholders in Canada will be in a far better
position than they have ever been in the
past, for the reason that Lloyd's will be
obliged to have a representative in this country, an attorney, with defined powers as stipulated by the Minister. That attorney can be
served with process. We do not need to go
over to London and hunt out Lloyd underwriters, to the number of 150; we serve their
attorney in Canada. Lloyd's are to come
under the jurisdiction of the Canadian courts
before they can do business here. That is
stipulated in the Bill. Furthermore, Lloyd's
bind themselves to this, that a judgment
against them by a Canadian court shall have
the same force and effect as if made by a
court in England. Consequently the deposits
there are immediately answerable for judgments obtained in Canada. This will put
their insured in this country in a safer
position. We are legislating for the insured.
Now, I do not wish to stand here as the
final authority on constitutional matters.
Suffice to say that in this respect I am seeking
to give the House the views of the Department of Justice, views which were clearly
enunciated and supported before the Committee by one of our greatest constitutional
authorities, the Hon. N. W. Rowell. I think all
members of the Committee will agree that
after many days of contention his argument
stood intact. Such being the case, are we
serving any useful object by shutting the
door and again inviting litigation, when we

will operate as they have always operatedwith the assistance of provincial licences and
without the protection to the insured that
this proposed law provides?
Such is the argument in support of the Bill.
It is not strictly a Government but a departmental Bill, which we seek to have reviewed
on its merits. The decision in this issue
was left to the Committee without any
imprimatur of the Government whatever, the

they were flot actually soliciting business in
Canada, that those who wanted to insure their
property had to apply direct to the Mutuals
at Boston or elsewhere in the New En.gland
States. The policyholders testified that not
only was the cost of the insurance so low
that no aid-line insurance company could comnpete, but they were also receiving the benefit
of a very stringent inspection service which
suhstantially reducoed the fire risk. On the
strength of that testimony we excepted the
Mutuals from our system of cantrol and supervision. I have not changed my opinion with
respect to those companies. They are not
asking for our business; we go to them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: They have
provincial licences.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes. As to
this proposed legislation, like the right hionourable gentleman I arn in favour of the
federai authorities retaining a measure of control over the insurance business. I have
watched the supervision of fire and life insurance campanies by aur Insurance Department, and i think it has no superior in any
cou.ntry. I have seen its officiais at their
work in insurance companies with which 1
arn connected, and I appreciate their invaluable assistance.
As my riglit hýonourable friend lias said,
the Superintendent of Insurance is absolute]y
opposed to the provisions of the Bill with
respect ta Lloyd's.
I arn prepared to go a long way to ensure
that the courts will, if occasion arises, declare
the legisiation constitutional.
To the Hon.
Mr. Rowell and to my right hanourable fTiand
I have put this question: "In requiring a
deposit of securitias fraim foreign and from
Canadian insurance companies is your legisiation on solid rock? Will it withstand the
test ibefore the courts?" Their answer is in
the affirmative. I appraciate its soundness,
for it is a geneTal principle of the Bill that
ail foreign companies shall pratect their
poficyhiolders by depositing sacurities with the
Government.
But suppose that Lloyd's pleaded: "This
legisiation is directed against, insolvency or
bankruptcy. It is inoperative as against us,
because we have millions of dollars in aur
treasury and an deposit in England under
the insurane law of that country. There is
not the remotest poasibllity of aur ibecoming
insolvent or bankrupt." And suppose that
their contention was upheld by the courts.
Would it follow that insurance companies
not constituted in tha saine way as 'Lloyd's
would be su:bject to ail the provisions of the
Act? Or would the courts go further and
74728-21 j

2

make this distinction: "jYes, the law is constitutional, but, its prime purpose being ta
guard against insolve-ncy or bankruptcy of
insuranca campanies, it is inoperative against
any campany that can furnish conclusive
proof of solvency"? Verily, I cannot imagine
any tribunal, particularly the Privy Council,
delivaring sucli a judgment.
However, there is one thing ta which I
cannot reconcile myscîf. My riglit honourable friend says that by disarming an influential institution that stands as the mast
seriaus obstacle in aur path we gain the
advantage of making this legislation unassailable before the courts. But surely a vast
number of people interested in one way or
another will flot favour such a law simply
because there- is a chance of eliminating the
hostility of Lloyd's. The proposed exception
goes against my own feelings. Insurance coimpanies are very numerous in Canada. At
first they were mostly foreign campanies, but
during the last fifty ye.ars or so many Canadian companies have developed. Competitian
is very keen, even in the matter of the
premiums charged by the variaus campanies.
Now ail these campanies say, "If you make
an exception in the case of sucli an arganizatian as Lloyd's, they will be able ta came
here and undersell thair campetitors."
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:. But is
that true?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should think
it is. They will undersell ta the extent of
the saving effected by means of the privilege
you gave them of not having ta, open agencias
here, as other companies must.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, noa.
There is no diffarence whatevar.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You will allow
me ta develop that point. What is donc now
by Lloyd's, so far as publicity and representation are concernad? Nothing. Other
campanies have agents throughout Canada.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honoux'able member is misinformed. There are men
writing business for Lloyd's in Regina, and,
I think, riglit through ta the Coast. Certainly
there are in Montreal. It is ahl a question of
what. yau eall them.

they do net confine tbemsclves te that wvork,
exclusively; they place insurance for Canadian and fereign companlies.
This is the system followed by Lloyd's.
An agent in Edmonton, or anywbere ebs,,
asked by a client te place seme insurance with
Lloyd's, ivires te an agent of Lloyd's in
Montreal, who cables te London. Tbe Montreal agent may say thiat ho will carry the
risk till be gets thec policy, or the next day
he may receive an answer inferming biim
that the risk is covered. It is a weck or two,
or perhaps two months, before the policy is
sent eut.
The griex once of the othier insurance comnpanies is that while tbey maintain tbeir
establishments bore, pay rent and taxes, and
employ staffs in order te carry on their
business, Lloyd's escape these respensibilities
and charges by carrying on their business by
cable from London, and for that reason can
quote lower rates. The companies in the
Canadian field wvbe comte under the Canadian
law bave built up their hu5ýincss boere and

That is the only

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is the principal argument I have heard-that a large
institution like Lloyd's would be able to, say:
"We are in a different class fromn the smaller
institutions, like the Royal, or the Liverpool,
London & Globe. We are Lloyd's. We offer
perfect security, and have been allowed by
the Dominion Governinent to do business
without having to abide by the law governing
the other companies."

not be a great talking point for tbe other comnpanies to say that Lloyd's have no deposit in

Hon. W. A. GIESBACH:
gentlemen, on Tucsday of last xveek we
reacheci a certain stage of this debate on. the
proposai of the honourable gentleman from
Vancoiîver-a stage markod by a speech made
by the honour:îble senator from IParkdale
urok.There were some items
(lion. Mr.
in the honourablo gentleman's address wliich
I could approve, but candour requires me
to say that most of therm were quotations
fromn the speeches of others.

masses. He believes himself to be the champion and the tribune of those toiling masses,
and when hoe can find no0 actual oppenents
hie consiructs themn and thon knocks them
down. In this respect hoe is a veritahie Don
Quixote.
In the course of bis speech the lionourable
gentleman dev oted a good deal of time te
certain observations made by the honourablo
gentleman from Vancouver. The honourable
gentleman from Vancouver is reputed to be
well-off. I have no personal knowledge of
bis circumstances, but sncb is common report.
1 do know the honourable gentleman ba-s
rendercd distinguisbed service to bis country
in several important spheres of the national
life. The honourable gentleman from Parkdale melodramatically quoted Scripture to the
effect that it is casier for a camel te enter
the oeye of a ncedle than if is for a rich man
1 wil
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

MAY 1, 1934
read the exact words he used in that connection:
Even if 1 arn alone in my viewpoint I arn
entitled to it, and I hold here and now that
the capitalist and the capitalistic institutions
of this and the other countries of the world
are alone responsible for the wars that have
taken place heretofore; and that if another
war eûmes it will be largely, if nlot entirely,
the resuit of either their activity or their
inactivity in this matter.
Now, first of al, the honourable gentleman
frorn Parkdale accused the honourable senator frorn Vancouver of insincerity; in the
second place, he levelled at hirn the charge
of being willing to prornote war for his own
personal aggrandizernent. You will rernember
that the honourable gentleman from Vancouver was net in his place. Had hie been
in his place he would have been entitled to
dlaim the protection of this House and insist
on the withdrawal of those two observations.
As hie wus fot in his place, however, the
debate goes out to the country without any
interruptionHon. Mr. MURDOCK: A point of orderl
1 arn in my place, and would challenge the
honourable gentlemn who is speaking to give
a cencrete instance where 1 charged the honourabla senator frorn Vancouver with the
things it has just been stated I charged him
with. Now, stick to the truth, pleasa.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If thera is any
doubt as to whomn the honourable gentleman
was referring to, I will read the preceding
words:
As I have already said a couple of tirnes
to-night, I arn sorry the honourable senator is
net here, hecause I think he is among those
Canadians, numbering about ten per cent of
our population, who, with sirnilar persons
throughout the world, are responsible for wars
and rumeurs of wars. Nothing more true was
ever uttared in this world than the 25th verse
of the 18th chapter of Luke, where it is said:
"For it is easier for a carnel to go through a
needle's eye, than for a rich man te enter into
the Kingdom of God."
May I ask who it was that the honourable
gentleman from Parkdale was referring to
when he used these words? Undoubtedly he
was referring to the honourable senator from
Vancouver.
Ha was aceusîng hima of insincerity, and in those portions of his speech
in which he deprecated war he was charging
him with a desire te provoke war. Those are
my two complaints. Now, what has my hionourable friend to say to that?

327

read Hansard to ferrn their own conclusions.
I arn in no doubt as te what conclusion they
wîll cerne te.
But let me pass fromn that to a general
discussion of the charge that capitaliste and
waalthy men promete war. I know the purpose of such a staternent. It will ha read in
scores of meetings aIl over Canada, and, hecause it was made in the Senate and was not
controverted at the tirne, it will be praached
as gospel; and thousands of men will believe
it because they see it in print.
Let us consider precisely what the statement
means. The charge is that wealthy men,
capitalists and others, are interesteil in promoting war. What would happen in this
country if Canada became engaged in a war
of the magnitude of the last war? Either there
woiild ha an immedi-ate repudiation of our
national debt, or, as a result of the efforts
to obtain monay te carry on the war there
would be a complete failure in value of our
entire bonded indebtedness, including that of
the provinces. Undoubtedly there would he
conscription of wealth, and further, such taxation as weuld practically clean up the wealthy
men of the country. Now, our bonds are'
hald by the well-off men of the country, and
by our banks, insurance cempanies and great
corporations. In case of war they would be
the sufferars. If anybody in Canada would
gain by war it would ha the man who has
the least. In my .iudgrnent, therefore, it is
uttarly foolish and absurd to urge sariously
t hat well-off men who hold thýeir waalth in
the forrn of bonds of our federal and provincial
goverrnents, as most of them do, are interested in prornoting war. Such a statement is
an in.sult te the intelligence of those te whomn
it is addrassed. I wender j ust why the honourable gentleman has the ternerity te address
such an observation te us. The answer is
that hae knows we do net believe it; in reality
hae is addressing it te those outside the House
who may ha impressed by it. The honourable gentleman seeks te create disseinsion, te
engender hatred, te prornote class war.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What are you going
to do about it?

Hon. Mr. MURD'OCK: Honourable senators, I do net mnd being charged with many
and varieus things, but 1 respectfully deny
the right of my honourable friand te datermine what was in my mind, or te whom I
was talking. If he would, speak te the subjeet sud neyer mnd telling me what I
meant and te whomn I was talking, I thin-k
the 'Senate and the outside public would be
better info.rmed. I have ne retraction te
make.

the impression that the purpose of this
motion was to father goodwill upon earth
and peace among men. On my return here
I read the remarks of the honourable gentleman. I do not believe that my speech in
mtroducing this motion was of that antagonistic kindHon. Mr. MURDOCK:
order?
Hon. Mr. McRAE:

Is this a point of

It will be.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wish to ask His
Honour the Speaker if a point of order is
being stated or another speech being made.
Hon. Mr. MoRAE: I am speaking, honourable senators, on the speech of the honourable gentleman from Parkdale of Tuesday
last, which speech from beginning to end
rings with a charge of insincerity. I contend,
honourable senators, that the honourable
gentleman has said either too much or not
çnoughHon. Mr. MURDOCK:
That is not a
point of order. Let the gentleman who is
at bat do what has to be done. The honourable gentleman from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) will have his turn a little later. I
submit that in rising to a point of order he
should not do as he did when he gave notice
of his motion, namely, make a speech just
te catch the popular fancy.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: My turn has come
right now. I say that the honourable gentleman said either too much or not enough. If
ho said ton much, he ought to take it back;
if he did not say enough, there are methods
by which he may complete his charge, and
I invite him to use them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
of order?
Hon. Mr. McRAE:

Is that a point

I am going to read-

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will take back
nothing that I said in that speech.
I am
only sorry now that I did not say more, as
I could have done, to complete it.
I might call
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
the attention of the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MoRae) to the fact
that he will have the right to make another
speech when this debate is being concluded.
I think that a speech should not be made on
a point of order.
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: When I listened,
as I did last Tuesday evening, for some two
and one-half hours to the speech of the honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock), and when I read it later in Hansard, I could not help thinking of another
champion of labour who not long ago sat in
this House and has since left us. The late
Senator Gideon Robertson was a labour man.
He held every office in the gift of his union.
Incidentally, it is not on record that ho was
ever ousted from any office, or that he appealed to the courts to keep him in office.
He had the confidence, the respect and the
affection of labour people from one end of
this country to the other, as well as in the
neighbouring United States. He was also a
member of this House, and here too he had
the confidence, the respect and the affection
of all. He was a great Canadian and a great
labour .man. It is to be remembered that
whenever any problem came to him ho approached it with a deep sense of responsibility,
not only to labour but to the whole of his
country.
That is all I have to say to my bonourable
friend from Parkdale at the moment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I shall return to
him hter on, when I come to discuss the value
and the truth of some of his observations.
We are discussing the motion of the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae) with respect to the League of Nations.
Now, there have been other leagues of nations in the past. Every great war of times
gone by bas resulted in an attempt, for the
purpose of maintaining peace and of securing
the fruits of victory, to continue the alliances
which the war provoked. It is a matter of
record that all these leagues gradual-ly died,
faded away, by reason of the growing diversity
of international interests brought about by
fluctuations in trade, population and industrial
development and the consequently altered
relationships among the parties to the Iague.
That, I say, is the history of leagues in the
past. Therefore when, after the Great War,
an attempt was made to form a new League
of Nations on a larger and more comprehensive scale than ever before, there were those of
us who ventured to think that history would
repeat itself, that the factors that had destroyed previous leagues would in due course
operate with respect to this one. In another
place in 1920 I envisaged precisely that situation.

MAY 1, 1934
The present League, arganized in 1919, was
primarily intended ta be-indeed actually
was-a League of conquerors for the purpose
of safeguarding the gaine that had been
made, maintaining peace, giving security,
and so on. The primary objeet was the
maintenance of the status quo. Now, upon
the face of it, the maintenance of the status
quo is a desirable thing, but tlhraughout life,
wherever we look, we find that the warld is
on the mave, that people are constantly
rnarching forward or backward or in some
other direction. There is constant change
and fluctuation. Theref are ta attempt by
means of a League of Nations ta, guaranýtee
forever the status que is simply ta proceed
contrary ta nature.
Deaaig with the present League af Nations and Canada's connection with it, I
should like ta draw the attention of the
Bouse ta the fact that when, in 1919 or 1920,
the Treaty of Versailles, with the League's
Covenant attached, was brought before this
Parliament, we moved against the implications of article 10. We were the first people
in all the warid ta, do so. Article 10 is that
section of the Covenant which en-visages the
use of force ta carry out the Covenant, ta
punish wrongdoers, ta proteet the weak, and
se on. And in 1922 or the foilowing year aur
delegates ta Geneva were definitely instructed
ta proceed against it at gatherings of the
League itself. Without fear af contradiction,
I venture ta say that of ail the members of
the League Canada was the flrst ta take the
move which now appears ta have torpedaed
the organizatian, or, ta, use another metaphor,
ta have robbed it of any teeth that ihad.
Article 16, whieh is the section deaiing with
blockades and se, on, has generally been considered ta be unworkable.
The Canadian end of the League of Nations9 has falien largely inta the hands of
paciflsts or people pacifistically inclîned.
Here was a proposai ta maintain peace by
force. Support for the organization was supposed ta came from people wiliing ta fight for
peace. With the repudiation of article 10 the
League could no longer rely on force to
execute its judgments; it had ta rely on public
apinion. I submait that a study of human
nature and of history can iead to but anc
conclusion: that a League of Nations supported by pacifists is fram its very inception
wholiy ineffective. Such a League as was envisaged in 1919 muet be supported by those
who join it with their eyes open, who know
what the implications are and do nat shrink
from. the prospect of using force.

329

In the somewhat checkered history of the
League several items stand out with more or
liess prominence. Fifty-eight nations joined
the League in 1919. Ail the smaller nations
came in on the understanding that the League
would give them security-that in any disputes
or *misunderstandings which might arise between a smaii nation and a stronger the
League would intervene and guarantee security
or a peaceful settiement. That idea was
shattered in the early history of the League.
While the Parliament of Canada wa-s busily
engaged taking the teeth out of the Covenant
of the League by the repudiation of article 10,
something very definite happened in 1923 between Italy and Greece. My honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) in
the course of his speech purported to give the
facts of this international incident, but they
are not the facts. He said:
In 1923 an alarming situation developed
between Itaiy and Greece in connection with
the murder of some Italians. An ultimatum
was issued upon Greece by Italy, and the
island of Corfu occupied by the latter country.
Greece appealed to the League of Nations. and
the Council, with the assistance of the Conference of Ambassadors, secured the evacuation of
the occupied island, and war was averted.
This*statement is very far frein the facts.
True, some Italians were shot on August 27,
1923,-a general, a lieutenant and a private
soidier. On the following day the Italian Gos'ernment issued an ultimatum asserting the responsibi'lity of the Greek Government and
demanding the fullest explanation, the most
solemn public apology, immediate and strict
inquiry, a ceremony of expiation in Athens
cathedrai, a salute to the Italian flag, the
arrest and execution of the murderers, and
payment of an indemnity of 50,000,000 lire.
The Greek Government hesitated, in fact
demurred, and on August 31, three days later,
the Italian fleet appeared off Corfu and opened
fire, killing twenty persons and wounding
eighty, after which a force of marines were
set ashore to occupy the island. Greece appealed ta the League of Nations. Thec League
prepared ta take action. T-hereupon Italy
informed the League that if it interfered in
the dispute she would withdraw from membership. The League at once dropped the
matter. Greece was powerless to resist, and
comipied with every article of the ultimatum.
In a word, the League was impotent ta protect the weaker power. It wiil be observed
that 'the actual course of events is entirely
différent from. the story related by the honourable senator from. Parkdale. I suggest that by
our repudiation of article 10 we made a distinct contribution te the impotence of the

330

SENATE

League in Ithis instance. ln justice to the
Italian Goverroment it should be stated that
it sent the 50,000,000 lire 'to repatriate refugees
in the Balkans and other countries.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Did nlot Mussolini
restore the Order uf the Knights of Malta
and give them thec 50,000,000 lire hecauise hie
was ashamed to use the money for governmental purposes?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
The Italian
Government mav have done that. The hionourable gentleman fromn Parkdale next deait
with the war betw-een Paraguay and Bolivia
and said:
In 1928 active hostilities took place betwcen
Bolivia and Paraguay.
T'ie League Council
immediately exercised its good offices, and as a
resuit the frontier fighting w-as arrested and
the dispute wvas settled through the miedium of
the Pan-Americaln Union, whicli Ias insession
at Washington at tlie time.
The honourable gentleman is mistaken in
bis so-called facts. The League of Nations
did appoint a comsmission. The commission
went down to South Ainerica, but Ivas unable
to bring about peace. The hionourable gentleman secins to tliink tliat the Pan-American
Union bias soinething to dIo wvîth the League
of Nations.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCE:

Not at ail.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
I arn glad tlic
bonouîrahle
genl'man knows that much
about the niatter.
In point of fact flic
League of Nations did intervene, but was perfectly hieipless to settle the quîarrcl. The war
is still iii progress, and a few wecks ago the
press elîcoîieled the capture of sonne 20,000
Bolivians by flic Paraguayans.
The most marked failuce of the League of
Nations was manifested in connection with
flic situation which arose between China and
Japan. The events are fresh in the memnory
of ail honourable gentlemen. Two years ago
thic Japane5se invaded Manchuria, and at the
same time delivered a heavv attaek on
Shanghai with an army 100.000 strcng. Their
operations in Mancliuria were successful and
thcy took possession cf three provinces cf
China with a population of 33,0W0,000.
At
tlie rcqucst of China the League of Nations
intervcncd. It appointed a commission, whiclh
visited Shanghiai and Manrhuria, made a carefui study nf the situation, and repcrted
strongly against Japan. Japan's action was
contrary to the Covenant of the League, to
the Kellogg Pact and to the Nine-Power
Treaty guaranteeing maintenance of the "open
donc" in China. But Japan hias ignored the
representations made by the League and bias
set up the puppet state of Manchukuo.
Hlon.

MAr. (;1IESBACH.

Specifie instances, chronologically acranged,
show that thic League cf Nations can guarantc no security whatcver te the small
powers-those that became members for the
vcry purpose of sccurity.
Now I turn to some observations made by
my honoucable and gallant friend fcom Vancouver (Hon. Mc. McRae). At page 238 of
Hansard hie is reporte-d as f ollows:
Britain's foreign policy (Ices not offer much
encouragement.
Since the formation cf the
League cf Nations flfteen years ago, liec policy
as a whole bias been very indefinite. At the
moment, if we mýay cedit the press reports,
Britain is negctiating, not thcough the League,
but (direct with France, on the old pre îvar
basis cf coalition. Tîsere are sevecal other ontstanding instances of Britain's failure to miake
use cf the League.
I ccntrcvert this statement.
1 assert, first,
that since its organization there bias been no
more active or vigorcus or consistent supporter cf the League than Great Britain bierself.
I am not preparcd te adumit that
British statesmen are at ail times rcady to
agcce witli everything put forward by the
Leag-ue.
After ail, those wlîo control the
affairs cf the League are more or lcss secondrate men cf the member-nations whîiih tiîey
represent. On the contrary, responsible ministers cf tie Crown always spcak for Great
Britain. There hiave been inany occasions in
the past fiftccn years whcn Great Britain Iras
rîglit and the League wrong.
Hon. Mc. CASGRAJN:
The honourable
gentleman froin De Lorimier (lon. 'Mr.
Danduranul) is not a second-rate msan.
Hon Mc. GRIESBACH: Hie is a, brilliant
exception. lIn this respect I need cite but
one case.
The comie opera Republie of
Liberia, on the west ccast cf Africa, wvas
foiînded by slaves who were liberated after
the American Civil War. The armed forces
cf Liberia had for 1-cars beien waging wac
upon the tribes cf the interior, tlestroying
their settlemenýts, killing tlie men and enslaving the women and children.
Finallv the
native tribes appealed to the League cf
Nations. The League sent a commission te,
Liberia, and ultimately it recommcnded that
the tribesmen should consent to be di.'armed.
Relying on the protection cf tise Leaurue,
they accepted the recommendation. The
responsible representatives cf the British
Gcvecnment in the adjacent colonies advised
against sncb a course, and pointcd out that
the only solution cf the trouble was tc disarmn bath sides. The British Government
s0 cepocted to the League cf Nations. Neyertheless the unfoctunate natives were disarmed. The wocld learns now that, taking
advantage cf their enemies' defenceless state,

MAY 1, 1934
tbe armed forces of Liberia are exterminating
tbem rutblessly.
I repeat Great Britain bas consistently supported tbe League since its inception, and bas
given it indirect support by maintaining a
constant peace effort. No otheT country in
tbe world bas sucb an urgent need for peace
as bas Great Britain. Peace is essential for
hier recovery from bier exertions in the Great
War. I venture to assert tbat no country in
tbe world bas in tbe last fifteen years so persistently pursued the ideal of peace as bas
Great Britain. She bas carried out a policy
of armament reduction to the point wbere
lier national security is now endangered. Sbe
is ever ready to engage in consultation witb
any nation disposed to discuse disamament.
Indeed, for the last tbree years she bas taken
the lead in the Disarmament Conference.
Consequently I cannot accept the observations
of my bonourable and gallant friend when bie
critîcizes Great Britain's attitude towards the
League.
I desire to direct tbe attention of bonourable members to an outstanding example of
Great Britain's recognition of the League
and bier readiness te submit berself to the
Covenant. First, I cite the case of Iraqor Mesopotamia as it was during the War.
This great territory is occupied by Arab tribes.
Tbe League of Nations mandated tbe country
to Great Britain. Great Britain began ber
She
work of reconstruction immediately.
estaiblisbed law and order, set up educational
and judicial systems, and placed tbe finances
of the country on a sound basis. In short she
welded the separated and wandering tribes
into a modern state. Having completed bier
task, sbe surrendered bier mandate, retired
from the field, and a.ssuired the League that
she would continue to support the new state
of Iraq. Great Britain is the first country to
complete bier task and surrender bier mandate.
New I pa.ss to anotber important side of
the question. Great Britain draws from Persia
ail the oul fuel supplies for bier navy and
mercantile marine. A dispute arose with
respect ta the terms of the oil leases, and
witbout discussion or consultation tbe Persian
Govern.ment arbitrarily took possession of
the oil fields. Great Britain might have deciared war, but sbe did nothing of the sort.
On the contrary, she appealed to the League
of Nations. The League intervened, and a
proposal was made that the case should be
submitted ta the Court of International
Justice. This was agreed ta, and Great Britain
won bier case.
I arn afraid the honourable and gallant
senator from Vancouver confuses aur obligations under the League witb aur obligations

331

as part of the British Empire when bie deplores
the possibility of our becoming involved in
war. I have pointed out that under tbe
League we are no longer bound by section 10,
and that section 16 is admitted to be inoperative. So far as our Imperial connection
is concerned, it is well established that the
Parliament of Canada must decide, whether
or iiot we will engage in war. The bonourable gentleman suggests that Canada should
withdraw from the League, and thus avoid
any poasibilîty of becoming emibroiled. I contend tbat our membership in the League does
not in the slightest degree render us liable
to take part in. war. Article 10 bas been repudiated. Article 16 is valuele6s. How, then,
can we become involved in war because of
our membership in the League? My view is
that our membenship will not get us into, war,
neither will it keep us out.
The honourable gentleman in the course of
bis speech made another important statement that 1 feel called upon to combat.
Speaking last February in tbe debate on the
Address, bie said, as reported at page 45 of
Hansard:
1 cannot conceive of any developments wbich
would justify this country in sacrificing the
blood of one single Canadian on the future
battle-fields of Europe.
H1e voîced a similar sentiment on April
17 last, as appears at page 244 of Hansard:
Call me an international pacifist if youi will,
for 1 would have Canadian boys fight no more
in foreign-wars.
This expression of opinion bas attracted a
good deal of attention. Witb respect ta it
tbe bonourable gentleman and tbose wbo tbink
as ble does must accept as a basis one of two
different propositions: first, that the situation
which confronted Canada in 1914 wiIl neyer
repeat itselfHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Wby?
Hon,. Mr. GRIESBAOH: The honourable
gentleman must follow me closely. First,
that tbe situation wbioh confronted us in
1914 will neyer be repeated.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Wby?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Because the bcmourable gentleman says so.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have quoted the
speech of the bonourable gentleman from
Va.ncouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) in which bie
says that neyer again s9hould Canadian
soldiers shed their blood in a foreign land.
I say that anyone wbo, makes that statement
must base it on one of two propositions:
eitber that neyer will there be a repetition of

332

SENATE

the state of affairs existing in Europe in
1914, or that the decision made and the
course of action followed by Canada in 1914
were wholly wrong, wholly unnecessary, and all
our sacrifices were in vain. If we can be sure
that the situation which arose in Europe in
1914 will never occur again, then we may say
that none of our soldiers will ever be called
upon to die in a foreign country. If that
view is not accepted, then the statement must
be founded on the alternative proposition,
that the decision we made ii 1914, and the
course we followed, were wholly wrong, wholly
unnecessary, and all our sacrifices were in
vain.
I cannot agree to either of those propositions. My knowledge of history tells me that
it is perfectly possible for the condition which
confronted this country in 1914 to be repeated.
I have no doubt about that, and I do not
agree that the course which we took in 1914
was wrong and our sacrifices were in vain.
On the contrary, I believe that we d'id the
proper thing. the thing from which there was
no honourable escape, and that in discharging
the tasks and duties and obligations laid upon
us we added tremendously to our stature as
a sovereign country and a nation of the
world.
Now I pass on to another statement made
by the honourable gentleman from Vancouver,
and inasmuch as it is a statemenit that is
made by a great many people, and appears in
many magazine and newspaper articles, I feel
that I have to treat it as being important.
Speaking of peace, the honourable gentleman
said:
After fifteen years of futile effort for international peace there remains but one way to
obtain the abolishment of war. The road is
open, clea-r and certain, and tests the sincerity
of the nations that say they iwant world peace.
I refer to the total discontinnance by all
nations of the manufacture ,and sale of armanients and munitions of %ar. Such a policy
fully enforced ivould' end war at no distant
date.
That is the belief of a great many people, yet
it is utterly unsound. First of all, let us
consider whether or not armaments have
something to do with the causes of war.
Everybody assumes that they have; but have
they? Take the cases of four countries which
even now are virtually on the verge of war.
Let us begin with France. France is armed
to the teeth and ready for war at any moment.
She is in that position because of external
conditions, primarily the threat of Germany.
Have armaments in themselves anything to
do with the willingness of Frenchmen to fight
flon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

and to die in the defence of their country?
Not at all.
On the otIier hand, Germany is armed. Is
Germany's readiness to fight based on an
armament industry? Net at all. She is ready
to fight because it is her nature so to do, as
the old nurscry rhyme used to have it, and
because she is determined to assert herself and
secure equality. That condition of mind on
the part of Germany is net superinduced by
armaments.
Then take Russia. In the last fifteen years
Russia has armed herself beyond any other
nation in the world. She bas a standing army
of 1,300,000 men, an army capaible of expansion to seven and a half millions; and she bas
a complete mechanization-tanks and the- like
-and an enormous air force. Yet she has no
private armament industry at all. What has
the armament industry to do with the
determination of Russia to be armed? Nothing
at all.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If Russia could not
buy arms, would that net have a great deal
to do with it?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They make them
in government factories.
The honourable
gentleman misses ny point. I say there is
no private armament industry in Russia at
all; consequently the armament business that
does exist there, which is a government industry, bas nothing to do with tecreation of
the determination of the Russian people to
be armed for the purpose of spreading their
peculiar political doctrines all over the world.
It has nothing to do with the spirit of the
Russian people or the determination to wage
war.
Japan to-day is spending eighty per cent
of her budget on arms and armaments. She
has her own armament industry. Will anyone seriously contend that she is armed
because of that? Not at all. She is armed
because she has but a small territory and
a large population, and is dctermined to
secure raw materials and find new markets.
The armament industry has nothing to do
with that condition of affairs in Japan.
So much, then, for the charge that the
armament industry provokes war. Later on
I shall deal with the extent to which it plays
a part in war. At the moment I am stressing
only the part that it plays in the creation
of the war mind.
I come now to discuss another part of my
honourable friend's remarks. He said:
I refer to the total discontinuance by all
nations of the manufacture and sale of armaments and munitions of war.

MAY 1, 1934
There are a great ma-ny people who believe
that if you could 'bring about a discontinuance of the manufacture of arms you would
promote peace. The Disarmament Conference spent months in discussing methode of
getting rid of the most modern arma, sucb
as tanks, aeroplanes, su'bmarines and very
heavy artillery. Alongaide that they considered horizontal cuts, effectives and reserves,
manufacturing possibilities, and so forth. It
becomes intere.sting, therefore, ta inctuire
whether the suppression of modern weapons
would really promote peace.
It does flot seem to me that one bas
to carry one's inquiry very far. Let us
assume that some omnipotent power bas
determined that after this date no weapon
invented since 1900 shall be manufactured
or used, and that the aeroplane, the submarine, very heavy artillery and gas shall
vanisb from the earth. What then? The
hiatorian would at once inquire whether there
were any wars before these weapons existcd.
In the century
0f course there were.
immediately preceding 1900 there were the
American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian
War, the German-Austrian War, the GermanDanisb War, the Crimean War, the Indian
Mutiny, and the last of the Napoleonic wars.
As a matter of fact, they made quite good
wars without having available the equipment
invented since 1900. 'But ]et us go back further and assume that this omnipotent power
bas9 ruled out aiýl the weapons invented since
1800, and that we are back to the days of the
old flint-lock musket. Will anyone say there
were no wars before 1800? The bloodiest
wars recorded in history took place i0 that
century under Marlborougb and the other
great commanders of that time. So, if you
fol]ow history back, you wilI see that the
quality of arms bas notbing to do with the
maintenance of peace. People fought just as
well witbout them as witb tbem. Go ,ack
century by century till you pass out of the
era of gunpowder into the age of the crossbow, and you will flnd that people were
figbting. The Battle of Crecy was fougbt
witb bows and arrows; the Macedonian
phalanx fought witb spears; and if you go
back far enough you will find that Cain
killed Abel with bis hare bands. Will anybody argue, then, that the manufacture and
the issue of modemn arms provoke war, or
that any control bf the arms industry will
affect the desire of anybody to go to war?
Would not the
Hon. Mr. McDONALD:
suppression of modern armaments stop the
havoc amongst civilians?
Hon. Mm. Gi1IESBACH: I do not know
bow important that is. If I could pick out

333

the civilians that were to be "done in," I
should be aIl for it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There are two
methods of arms production: first, manufacture in government factories, or factories
under government control, and secondly,
private manufacture. In the first place I
draw your attention to the fact that in any
industrialized country there is automatically
an armament industry. You cannot conceive
of a modern industrialized state wbich bas
not, aide by aide witb it, and mixed up with
it, a potential arms industry. I -remember
reading in the papers that came to us over-.
seas of tbe deligbt and joy of the people of
Canada that so many of their factories that
bad been turning out corkscrews and buttonhooks could make fuses, sheila, bomba, and
sa forth. Most states maintain governmental
establishments. In considering the problem
of security the rulers of a country must have
in mind the manufacture of arms, ammunition
and munitions generally. A country wbich is
not industrialized must provide itseîf witb
factories, an accumulation of material, and
the skilled labour necessary to produce al
the armament that it requires. This involves
a large expenditure of moncy. An industrialized country, on the other band, does noV find
it necessary to sink any of its money in
factories. It knows that it bas industries
wbich in ime of war will supply it with ail
the arma it needs. So, wbatever people may
say about the ammament industry-and many
sins can be laid at its door-it must be borne
in mind that, though it may be inopportune
to talk favourably of an armament industry
when peace prevails, it is a very comfortable
thing to have in time of war; and even in
time of peace the leaders of states are
interested in that fact, at least V-o this
extent, that they know they do not have Vo
spend government money on armament
manufacture.
Here in Canada we bave
normally about 150,000 rifles, 100 field guns,
and 500 machine guna.
Did we manufacture them ourseives? Not at al. We
bought them from the private armament
industry of Great Britain. If we bad noV
been able Vo get themn there, we sbould have
manufactured them ourselves, and we sbould
have been compelled Vo maintain, plants and
establishments and to accumulate the materials required, and Vo have the necessary staffs
standing by.
Sa there is something to be said for the
armament industry, notwithstanding the fact
that almoat everybody who discusses the suhject abuses the whole industry as tbough it

334.

SENATE

wvere composed of pickpockets. Some of the
things that arc said about it arc truc. It is
obvious tint a rumour of war or an actuel
war increa'ses its profits. But it is charged
that the industry prornotes and fomnents war.
1 cannot accept that 3-arn at ail.
It is easy
to make such a charge, but I venture to think
it cannot be proved. I would assert that in
ail great countries the statesmen and the
leaders wlie hav e the responsibiiity of governing and of making provision for the future
are fnot going to be greatly swayed by the
efforts of the munition makers, though it

bcad an example of an attempt te limit traffie
in arms in a critical situation, and 1 arn inciined te think that the resuit xvas typical
of what wc might exîwct from eny similer
attempt in the future. It xviii be remembered
that whien Japan and China were at grips
over Manchiuria, the Britis~h Ccx ernment, out
of a cicar sky, passed an Order in Council
te proihibit the export of munitions toecither
belligerent. Now, examine the wisdom of
that course. In the first place, the League
of Nations Commission bcd found that Japan
was the aggresser, the guilty party, and that
China wes the victim of Japanese aggression.
Japan bas an armarnent industry; China bas
none. Therefore when Great Britain piaced
an embargo on tbe expert of arms te either
eountry, though it was equaiiy effective against
both, it mereiy annoyed Japen, whereas
it seriousiy bandicapped the unfortunate
Chinese in their endeevours to defend tbemselves. Great Britain tben called upon all
the nations cf the world te join ber in this
rather foolish embargo, but ncbody answered
t4he ccli. At tbe end cf thirty dcys the embargo was witbdrawn, and then Great Britain
discovered tbat the United States had grebbed

wbich is used by France in regard to the maintenance of hier position, and by Germany
in making bier olaim, flot for security, but, as
she puts it, for equality. It is a very striking
group of words. If it suggests that there are
finally reaching my honourable friend some
glimmerings of the real situation, I welcorne it,
because I sbould like to believe that in the
end lie wjll corne to have a sound view on this
question.
There was a reference by the honourable
gentleman frorn lied Deer (Hon. Mr. Micbener) to sornetbing of wbich we frequently
hear, namely, the proposai to create a super
state, to have the League of Nations considered as a super power which would by force
suppress war and punish wrongdoers. That
was the conception many people bad of the
League when it was formed. Those who bclieved that articles 10 and 16 were to be the
cardinal features in the, structure of the
League envisaged to some extent an organization whicb would exercise police power
throughýout the world. Well, wbat sucli people
som-etimes forget is that a super state implies
a super conscience, a super will and a super
justioe.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And a super army.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACHI: It implies an
overriding of national sovereignty, a surrender
by sovereign states of just those very features
of the national life to which the people,
collectively and individually, dling most
tenaciously. A man clings to the free exercise of bis -own conscience in deterrnining
what is rigbt or wrong; bie maintains bis rigbt
to the exercise of bis wilI to do or to refrain
fromn doing; and lie is particularly desirous
that justice should prevail. I repeat that tbe
super state would require the surrender of
national conscience, will and justice. Therefore it is obvious that if sucb a proposai is
placed squarely before the world, even tbe
meanest nations will not consent to its
adoption.
lion. Mr. LYNCH-eTAUNTON:
Would
the bonourable gentleman allow me to ask
bim a question? Hau anyone ever suggested
a super state sucli as bie is defining?
Hon. Mr. GRI-ESBACH: Ob, yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Wbere?
Hon. Mr. 'GRIESBACH:
There is in
England at tbe present time a strongly supported movement for the creation of a super
state.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STATJNTON:
I amn
referring to a league of nations, not private
enterprise.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Tbe people bebind tbat movement are supporters of the
League of Nations wbo realize tbat the
League bas failed, but believe that it rnay
be rescued and given tbe new status of a
super state. It is to be inferred from tbeir
arguments tbat wbat many of tbern want is
an international police force. Now, it is impossible to conceive of such a force witbout
a conscience to direct its movementHon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Have we
surrendered our conscience and our rigbts to
our police force?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Dbh, no. We
gave very grudgingly, and we bave taken
some of the gif t back.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
Tbe bonourable
gentleman frorn Hamilton is referring to tbe
local police force.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACHI: I arn sure lie
does not mean tbat, because we are not discussing it.
As I say, there is in England a movernent
by League supporters for the creation of a
super state. Some of them say quite openly
that tbis is tbeir objective, wbile otbers say
so by implication. And tbey specify a super
police force as being necessary. When I say
a police force I mean, not an organization
equipped witb clubs, but armed forces comnprising military, naval and air branches, controlled and operated by the super state for
the punishrnent of wrongdoers, the maintenance of peace and the guarantee of security.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Was that not the
proposaI made to the League of Nations by
Mr. Tardieu of France?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Tbere are people
in France wbho advocate tbe creation of a
super state.
Hon. Mr. CASGRÀIN: And tbat proposai
was turned down by Cbamberlain.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I repeat thart tbe
meanest state will flot consent to the surrender of those things which would bave to
be surrendered if a super state were created.
I corne now to diseuss the question
whetber Canada will remain ini the League. It
lias been pointed out that our annual contribution to the 1&ague is $300,000. I amrn ot
questioning this figure at ail. It has been
a8ked what the League may usefully do.
Well, the League is rendering some very
valuabIe service riglit now, as is shown by the
following classification of some of its activities:

336

SENATE

Consultation, conference, international relations, economie relations, technical organization, health, backward states and aborigines,
drugs,
slavery,
humanitarian,
social and
refugees, epidemics, international law, registration of treaties, and labour relations.
I am sure that if the League will confine
itself to tasks such as are indicated in that
list, without pretending to do anything else,
it will fill a very necessary place in international relations. But should it seek to
take the place of an armed force, it could
guarantee no security. It is fairly obvious
that the smaller nations of the world have lost
all their confidence in the League with respect
to the most valuable service that it vas expected to render them, namely, the guaranteeing of security. The idea tiat it could
succeed in that direction bas been exploded,
and, as I said at the outset, we played a
prominent part in bringing this about.
But notwithstanding what has been said
by my honourable and gallant friend from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), and in spite
of the statements of those who support the
League, my guess is that our Government
will continue Canada's membership. I tbink
it will do so for this reason, perhaps among
others. There are in Canada a number of
people who believe in the League. They are
not quite clear about it, but they think that
in some way it

is going to maintain peace.

On the one hand the Government will weigh
the expenditure of s300,000, and on the other
the poscibility of a fight with these people.
So we shall continue to pay the money and
remain in the League.
As I stated beforr, there bave hen many

each of these bas in time become weak and
finally has been dissolved because of the growing conflict of interest between the component
parts and econonie, social and other developments. But there is another league, known
as the British Commonwealth of Nations.
When we examine it we find that, unlike the
League whose headquarters are at Geneva, it
has common ideals, a more or less common
language and a common law. Because of these
facts it avoids many of the troubles that tend
to disrupt the other organization. Furthermore, the British Commonwealth of Nations
has an abundance of raw materials and natural
resources, while many members of the League
are squabbling over such things. Then, too,
in the Commonwealth there is room for
expansion, whereas most of the important
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

member-nations of the League are overpopulated. Finally, I submit that we of the
British Commonwealth of Nations can provide
for our own security if we are willing to do
so and face the situation as it exists.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRIESBACH: The League of
Nations cannot guarantee the security of any
country. So I say that the League will
gradually sag at both ends and ultimatcly
give way in the middle. We shall continue to
support it as long as we can, for the reason I
have given. There will remain, however, the
British Commonwealth of Nations, which is
the league of nations for me and those who
think as I do. In that Commonwealth we
may find not only that security which is
essential, but scope and opportunity for all
the development that is necessary to make our
country great and prosperous.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Is he in
favour of the motion or against it?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I thought I ad
made it clear that I was not particularly
enthusiastic, either for or against it. I attach
no importance to it one way or the other.
But I will support the Government of the
day in the determination which I think it lias.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In other words, ve
should drift?

LEAGUE OF NATIONS
MOTION-DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion by Hon. Mr.
McRae:
That this House is of the opinion that
Canada should withdraw fromn membership in
the League of Nations, and that no further
money should be voted to the League.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable senators, I do not expeet to add anything to one
side or the other, of the controversy over this
subjeet. I thought the best contribution I
could make would be a résumé of the League's
difficulties and achievements, and to that end
1 refreshed my mind with some facts. Ail of
us, with a fe'w favoured exceptions, have experienced the blurring of memory concerning
events which at the time they happened were
so vivid and important that we feit we should
remember Vhem cleariy for ever.
I need not touch on that wonderful day in
Novemçber, 1918. That day, of ail days, with
the sens,- of relief which. it brought, is still
vividly remnembered by ail of us. I the early
months of 1919 representatives of the Allied
powers assenibled and drafted the Treaty of
Versailles and the Covenant of the League
of Nations. Bound up with that Covenant
were the decisions on various questions to
whioh the War and post-war conditions had
given rise. I refer to such matters as the
rectification of frontiers, the limitations and
punishments to be imposed upon Germany,
and the amount of reparations. Looking back,

we clearly recail the derision-I will not say
contempt-that was held by a great many
people, of whom I was one, for the opinion
of those economists who said that altogether
too mucb was being demanded from Germany.
Yet the economists proved to have heen right
in this respect.
The treaty was made, in the main, for countries which had struggled through four years
of war that had at times been of the most
cruel intensity in its effect upon their civil
populations and military forces. The countries which. suffered most had to some extent
been buoyed up by the view that they were
engaged in a war to end war. Even those
people who were not se, optîmâstic as to believe that that view was possible of realization by ordinary human beings, at any rate
expected great things to happen after the War.
But even with respect to this more limited
hope there had to be much disappointment.
The adjustment of boundaries in many cases
caused friction, notably with regard to the
Saar, and the Polish-East German Corridor.
Such questions as t.hese, and many others of
great importance and difficulty, were dealt
witb, to the best of their ability, by men who
had borne the heat and toil of the day during
four long years, men who had heen trained
in the old sehool of statesmanship and who
acted whenever possible in accordance with
the tenets of that sehool. They were faced
with the difficulty of making adjustments between the piedges which many of them had
given while the resuit of the confliet was still
in doubt, and the aspirations-mi some cases,
possihly the just demands--of other states.
By these worn and weary men there was
signed in the spring of 1919 the Treaty of
Versailles, the forefront of which was the
Covenant of the League of Nations. I cali
the attention of the House to the preamble of
the Covenant:
The High Contr-acting Parties, in order to
proînote international co-operation
and to
achieve international peace and securityThere is not a word about the prevention of
war.
-by the acceptance of obligations not to
resort to war, by the prescription of open,
just and honourable relations between nations,
by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of
conduct among Governments, and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for
ail treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another, agree to thîs
Covenant of the League of Nations.
There followed certain articles prescribing
the course of action in the event of disagreement among nations, with which articles I
need not deal.

as examples of the failure of the League to
bring about peaceful settlements, I maintain

problems.

greater importance than the dispute in regard
to the Polish corridor came up during the
years 1923, 1924, and thereabout. The situation was very irritating to, Germany, and
Poland naturalIy held on to ail the privileges
wbich. had been given her by the Treaty of
Versailles. That dispute bas been settled, the
difficulties in regard to Silesia have been
wiped away, and Poland, with its splendid
though iIl-starred past, can now look forward
with confidence to the future.
It is interesting to note that under the
mandates there bais been practically fno
complaint raised by the various peoples
concernied.
Another conspicunus example of this kind,
and one that holds the interest of people
who have read books by Lawrence, is to be
found in the case of Iraq, or Mesopotamia,
as it was previously called. At the time of
the War the peoples of 'that country were
principally wande-ring Arabs. Britain assumed
a protectorate over Iraq, and Lawrence
brought the natives together and organized
them, and flnally was successful in establishing tbemn as a nation. Only the other day
their na;tionhood was recognized by the
League, and tha-t country became a member
of the League.
Another great triumph was the philanthropie
work carried on by Nansen, formerly known
to us as an intrepid explorer, who represented
bis country at Geneva, and devoted himself
to the restoration of war refugees. For the
great part they bad been prisoners of war,
and as a consequence of the downfall of
Russia and the defeat of Germany their
condition had become truly appalling. Then
there was the problem of the refugees from
Aleppo, in Asia Minor. This will ail be dealt
with by 1938--another great triumph of the
pacifie work of the League of Nations.
The Court of International Justice is so
well known that I need harly speak of it.
I should like, howeveT, to cail your attention to the Rockefeller donation to the
library of the League of Nations. The League
is attempting to establish-and it bas made
considerable progress-a library wbich. will
contain, as far as possible, ail the books on
aIl sûbjeets reiating to social and political
history and kindred matters. A friend of
mine told me some ten or fiftecn years ago
of the method followed by the Rockefellers
in making their donations. In one respect
they were made on a purely business basis.
An expert employed by tbem would vigit a
scbool, or library, or whatever migbt be the
institution to which. tbey considered making
a donation, wbere he would tboroughly
examine into its nature, economy and
74728--22 j

339

effectiveness, whereupon, if bis report was
satisfactory, the donation would. be made
witbout the institution concerncd being
informed that it was going to receive it. I
have no reason to believe thait the policy
and practice of the younger Rockefellers has
cbanged in that respect; and the fact that
one of the younger Rockefellers bas seen fit
'to donate $2,000,000 to the Iibrary o! the
League of Nations is a proof that the work
that is being done by it at Geneva is satisfactory and is producing good results.
To toucb again upon the benefits resuiting from the mepting together of the representatives of fifty odd nations of the world,
I may refer to the publicity wbicb attends
these meetings. We have aIl notîced, I
think, that when we are texnptcd to do a
mean thing or a wrong thing one of tbe great
stimulants to propriety is our knowledge
that other people wbom we know and respect
may learn about it; consequen-tly we are
less likely to do that mean or wrong tbing.
The same principle applies to nations, and
if the smalIest country can lay its case before
the League of Nations a great deal may be
accomplisbed.
If tbere is any lack of entbusiasm for tbe
League, I am inclined to tbink a littie o! the
blame may he laid to its title. I think the
French name, "La Société des Nations," is
a bappier one than tbe Englisb "League o!
Nations." The word "league " connotes
force, and practically notbing but force. It
is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as
a mi]itary, political or commercial covenant
or compact for mutual protection and assistance against a common enemy,
whereas "society" is defined as
an association withi one's fellow men in a
friendly or intimate manner; companionship
or fellowsbip.
I do not know how the French-speakîng
peoples at Geneva, who comprise ail but the
English, respond to, that connotation. To me
it seems that the termn "Society of Nations"
or "Commonwealth of Nations" would bave
been a happier and more hopeful one. However. tbat is but a trifle.
Another tbing which in my opinion bas
hýandîcapped the work of the League in its
efforts towards peace is the Prese. The headline writer bas a difficult task to arrange bis
type in such a way as to make bie papcr
attractive ta the prospective buycr. Consequently, even thougb beadlines are more
generally reud than tbe text, alarming and
startling things appeal to bim and to bis
manager more than do somne other important
items of news.

Righit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To answcr that

that the representative of the Netherlands

Lorner Gouin and 1, who were rcpresenting

w'hereas the allieci nations werc inSpircd by

value not only to thcmnsclves but the who!e
world.
Let me( quote from a recent issue of an
Englisli journal:

MAY 2, 1934
We are looking towards the League of
Nations for peace and security, shutting our
eyes to the fact that the Covenant can give
us neither unless we are able and willing to
discharge its obligations.
"Standing as I do," said Edith Cayell, a
few hours before her deatli, "in view of God
and eternity, 1 realize that patriotism is not
enough. 1 must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone." That cry of the heart
is casier in moments of exultation. It is
difficult to ipreserve that spirit during the
events of everyday life. And yet we shall
flot exorcise war by merely hating and forswearing it.
Security and freedom are
treasures of great price; they are flot to be
prese'rved by those who will flot incur a corresponding responsibility, or make themselves
ready to discharge obligations proportionate
to their demands. It will flot suiffice for
nations to abstaîn from coercîng each other
by force. They must learn to think how by
steps, slow but patient and persistent, they
can bring into beîng an order of society based
on the duty of each to ail, irrespective of
national limits.
A representative of Canada was at Versailles
when the treaty, including the Covenant of
the League, was signed. I think this country
will remain in the League and continue to
fulfil its obligations as expressed in the
Covenýant, until that great organization is
much nearer a breakdown than it now appears
to be. In its comparatively short history
Canada has experienced and overcome a number of crises. We have always fulfilled our
obligations, and I be-lieve always will do so. 1
trust I have made it obvious that I ar nfot in
favour of our witlidrawal fromn the League.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
apparently there are some other lionourable
gentlemen who desire to speak on this
subiect. So muci lias been said on it that
perhaps not a great deal more of importance
can be added, but there are a few observations I should like Vo make. However, I
prefer not to proceed hs afternoon, and if
no one is prepared to continue at this time
I would move the adjournment of tlie debate
until the next sititing of the House.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But there is at least
one honourable member who wishes to speak
now.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Very well. When lie
finishes, my motion will lie in order.
Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable members of
the Senate, in the speecli of the honourable
gentleman from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr
McRae) I found a great deal that was
interesting and much witli wliich I could

341

agree, but, if he wiIl pardon me for saying
so, notliing that seemed to me to support
bis resolution. I fully realize the burden
wliich the Great War placed upon Canada,
noV only in debt and taxation, but still more
in the loss of so many promising young lives
and tlie disabling of tliousands of others. I
sliare in the disappointment and disillusion
which so many people are experiencing as to
the results of the War. It was to be a war
ta make the world safe for democracy, but
since 1919 democracy lias been abolislied
from the greater part of Europe east of
France. It was to be a war to end war, but
subsequent events have illustraited the Vruth
of Milton's saying:
What can war but endless war still breed?
This of course does not belittie in any way
the sacrifices of those who fouglit and died
in tlie War, ami wlio are no more responsible
for these consequences Vlian the heroes of
the Liglit Brigade were for tlie blunder
which sent them to deatli.
Tliese are some reasons wliy we sliould
resolve neyer again to make such sacrifices
without more definite assurance of commensurate resuits. Tliey also show wliy if there
is another war we should very carefully
weigh the wliole question before we make
up our minds to participate or not. Whether
we sliould determine tliat question by the
ordinary exercise of governmental responsibility, by an election or by a referendum, is
a matter into which I shall not enter now,
because it would lead me away from the
main subject.
But at alH events the poet-war developments do not constîtute objections to the
League of Nations. They are due Vo conditions which existed for tliousands of years
before there was a league of nations. The
perilous situation that now exists in Europe
is the result not of following the counsels
of the League, but of defiance of them. In
fact,' the objections to ithe League destroy
one another. IV is said-Vhough I Vhink Vhis
argument is now praotically abandoned-Vliat
the League miglit lead Canada into war.
But on the other liand it is claimed tlit the
League is weak because it lacks an armed
force-it is a mere wooden gun. I freely
admit the objection whicli is grounded on the
lack of armed force.
The honourable gentleman from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) spoke eloquently on a
number of acliievements, not directly related
Vo the prevention of war, wliicli stand Vo tlie
credit of the League, with respect Vo narcotîc
drugs, labour, white slavery, epidemîc diseaises,
refugees, and many other subjecta. The lion-

342

SENATE

ourebb- gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) freely conceded these achievements, bot seemned to think they had no
relation to the preservation of peace. In that
1 disagree with him. I think that tbroughoiît
many centuries one -of the ceuses of war hes
been the popular obsession that ono nation
is the natural enemy of another. I do not
kunow any better way of ovorcoming that
obsession than by gctting the representatives
of varions nations into the habit of meeting
and trying to advance those intcrcsts whieh
are cemmon ýte them ail. When we corne te
think of it, that kind ef thing is really the
basis of our national civilizetions. It is truc
that we are dependent te a certain extent
upon physicel force, but in Canada we can
sec how very little of thait element is necessary for the suppression of our combative
tendencies.
We are et peace with one enother net onîy
because of the fear of the policeman, but
beceuse xve are accustomed te acting together
in varions ways, in chur-ches, in fraternel
orgenizet ions, in families. as neighheours,
as business mnen, and se on. These human
relations predispose us te a belief that our
interests are in the main comînon rather then
conflicting. My hope is tliet if the Leegue
is maintainetl, end if the region of conmen
advantage is persistently exploreil, tiîis field
of harmonicus humen relations xvili consteintly
be enlarged.
1 hiave heard it reinarked joeularly that
the Leegue of Nations, lacking physical force,
eught te be called the Leegue of Notions.
We have te put up wilh jokes, and I admit
that is net a bad one. But it shows the
extent te which we are under the power of
what the late President Theodore Roosevelt
termed "weasel words," words that mislead.
Merety substitute "League of Ideals" or
'Leegue of Ideas" foi' "Leegue of N-\otions,"
and you get an entircly different picture. In
the long run idees are greater than physicai
force. Whien we look et short periods of the
world's Listory xve rire looking at the eddy
rather than the streain, and it is easy te get
the notion thet nations are gox'erned by
physical force. But a long viecv gix os the
exactly opposite impression, ani shows -that
whatever results from physical force dees net
lest, that nothing remains but the product of
the intellect and the spirit. AIl the great
empires which fiourishied before the time of
Christ have passed away, and eut of ahl they
achieved throughi physical force nothing remains except inscriptions that are painfully
deciphered from monuments, or records carelessly inspected by visitors te museums. But

Wheni unir hodies are committsnl te the
ground, as in tilue they must he, the minister
niay proneunce over our dust the words of
St. Paul, "It is sown in weakncss; it is raised
in power."
In wvhat better way enu the
historv of Christianity be desrribed in a few
words? 0f the x'est Ronman Emipire, in whichi

I admit that these considerations are perhaps rather cold consolation. We shaîl have
te suhmit for semne timie te the rude of

for years te corne might will continue te overcorne right. But these are ne reasons why xve
should net throw our weight on the spiritual

BRIDGE COMPANY
SECOND

READING

Hon. G. V. WHITE moved the second reading of Bill 27, an Act to incorporate Thousand
Islands Bridge Comnpany.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Heretofore in
the other buse bridge bils have been sent
to the iRailway Cornmittee, because they provided for railway accommodation. This Bill
does not, and it was referred to the Private
Bills Committee. I would suggest that after
second reading it be considered by the Committee on Miscellaneous Prîvate Buis.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will tbe honourabhle gentleman explain the purpnrt of the
'Bill?
Hon. G. V. WHITE: It is to authorize the
.cnstruction of a 'bridge from. a point on the
Canadian side, across a couple of islands, to a
point on the American side, wbere it will join
a bridge which is being built from that end.
The two parts will constitute what is to be
lnown as the Tbousand Islands bridge. The
riglit honourable senator fromn Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) knows the geogTaphy of the district much better tban I do.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Is the bridge at
Brockville?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: No; it is being built
from a point known as Ivy Lea, in the vicinity
.of Gananoque.
HEon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it su'bsidized
'by the provincial or the federai authorities?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: No. The provincial
1Iegislature bas endorsed the projeet.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: What about the
Ujnited States end of the bridge?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: The necessary legisiation bas been passed. by the State of New
York.

343

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Who are to build
the 'bridge, the promoters or the bondholders?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I bave no information.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHA'M: 1 had 'better
give a word of erplanation, altbougb it is
flot my Bill. The bill I was interested in
some years ago was to authorize construction
of a bridge from. Brockville across to tbe
American side. The necessary capital was
avaîlable, but the then Governor of New
York State-now President of the United
States--vetoed tbe bill 'because be was
opposed to tbe construction of a toîl bridge.
This Bill is to conllrmn an arrangement for
the construction of a bridge farther west, at
a place called Ivy Lea. It is an attractive
summer resort, and is visited by a good many
Ottawa people. The bridge will be built
from the mainland to an island, tben to another island, and then over to the mainland
in New York State. I ar n ot taking objection to tbe Bill. I have read in the press
that the Ontario Government approves it,
and that in due course, wben the liabilities
are paid, that part of the bridge on the
Canadian side wilI revert to the province.
This is not an uncommon provision in bridge
bills passed in recent years, particularly those
with respect to international bridges.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second tirne.

JRADING

Hon, W. M. ASELTINE moved -the second
reading of Bill 29, an Act rcspccting the
Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman kindly explain the Bill?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, this Bill was considered by the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the House of
Commons and reported without amendment.
It bas also been approved by Mr. Finlayson,
the Superintendent of Insurance.
0f late years, the eompany has been writing automobile insurance--a type of insurance
unknown at the time of its incorporation.
This insurance is transacted on a cash basis.
Every $1,000 of insurance entitles the policyholder te one vote. Suppbse an automobile
insurance policy was written 'f or $100,000 public liability, $1,000 property damage, $1,000
collision damage and 81,000 fire and thef t.
The holder of that policy would pay a
premium of 880 and be entitled to 103 votes;
whereas tbe holder of a mutual policy of
$16,000 at the same premium would be

is the primary purpose of the Bill.
Section 4 provides:

SENATE
I shall not read any more, but shall try
to state in a briefer form what I was going to
read. In my opinion, if the country where
the suggestion of the League originated had
seen its way to become a member, the League
woul( have been a much more effective organization than it now is.
When I made these remarks I was not
speaking particularly on the League of
Nations, but was simply stating some views
that had been suggested to my mind by a
speech of the bonourable gentleman who leads
the left (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). For fear
that I may have left an impression which I
did not mean to leave, I may say that I
have never been an enthusiastic supporter of
the League, yet I do support it. I am simply
endeavouring to clarify the position which I
took.
There is one feature to which I desire to
refer, and which, it scems to me, is pertinent
to the League of Nations. In all the recent
talk of the League, in this House and elsewhere, the question of war has inevitably
arisen. I have heard or read speeches by
members, both of this and the other House,
in which they asserted that war was coming.
In one or two cases they even went so far as
to fix the date. A day or two ago I read in
one of our newspapers-I think it was the
Ottawa Journal-an item which seemed very
pertinent. It said that some people predicted
the coming of war at an early date as confidently as they predicted the coming of next
Christmnas. Then it re-ferred to a speech made
in a Chamber sinilar to this, in a country not
very far from here, wherein a speaker, on his
return from Europe, had said that to his certain knowledge, based on documents that he
bad seen, Japan was prepared to attack the
United States. That is another type of the
very same class of positive assurance that war
is coning. Yesterday I picked up this book
"Interdependence," which, as you all know,
appertains to the League of Nations, and I
read in it something that surprised me very
much. It is another instance of talk which
from my viewpoint is unwarranted and unjustifiable. In an article entitled "Canada and
the League," written by one Mr. Escott Reid,
there is a positive statement of what is going
to happen. Thbe prophets of old are net in it
at all. He says:
If the Dis-armament Conference breaks up
without reaching agreement, or if it agrees on
an increase of the total armaments of the
world, the collective system set up after the
w-ar to maintain peace will have failed. That
failure will be followed within perhaps ten
years by another great war or series of wars.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

He does net inerely express the opinion or
the expectation that this may happen; be
says positively that it will.
Those wars will mean to the world as a whole
the downfall of civilization as we know it. To
Canada they will mean the blasting of lier
hopes as a nation.
That class of unjustified and unjustifiable
taik and writing by persons in responsible
places and elsewhere, probably more than
anything else, endangers the peace of the
world. I think they shouid be more cautious.
It is easy to sway the public mind. It is the
im:pression created by persons who are
supposed to speak with authority which leads
the people te expect war; and if you get the
people to expect it there will probably be war.
There bas been fighting as long as there
has been recorded history. The millennium
bas not yet arrived, but men are becoming
better and wars more humane, notwithstanding much that is said to the contrary.
There bas been much talk, and very strong
talk, about the manufacture of armaments.
That question was, I think, dealt with and
explained very well by the honourable and
gallant senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach). Ald that I want to add is the
statement that I do net believe that armaments lead to war. People fought when they
had nothing to fight with but their bare
hands; then they fought with clubs, and later
with stone axes or tomahawks; and the wars
of those times were wars of extermination,
more disastrous than any conflicts that have
occurred since the invention of armaments as
we know them. Armaments are not the causes
of war; they are the implements used to end
a war that bas been declared. I believe the
condemnation of the people who make armaments is entirely unjust and unwarranted.
We have no armament factory in Canada,
but if there were one here the manufacturer
would be making implements of war because
the people of
anada permitted it. And he
would be working under the 'aws of Canada,
just as an armament manufacturer in Great
Britain, France or Germany, or anywhere else,
operates in harmony with the laws of bis
country. A man is justified in carrying on
this business where the laws permit it. If any
are in the wrong they are the people of those
countries in which the business is legitimate,
for it would be stopped at any time if through
their votes they expressed a desire to have it
stopped. If all the countries of the world
agreed not to make armaments, wa-r would net
thereby be prevented. We should not blame
armament makers for war any more than we

biame distillers for ail the drunkards in the
world. There wouild be ne distilleries unless
people wanted te consume their produets.
Why should we say that tihe armament maker
is chiefly responsible for bringing about war?
History shows, in my opinion, that hie is not.
Another apparent failacy that is frequentiy
expressed and I believe generally credited is
that war is much more horrible to-day than
it was in the past. It bas often been said and
rarely contradieted that the iste war was the
blocdiest in history. Yet the facts are quite
contrary te this statement. I want to make
a few comparisons between wars of the past
and the iast war te illustrate what 1 mean.
1 will go back ne farther than the battle of
Thermopylae, with the record cf which all
honcurable members who are Greek seholars
are familiar. About ninety per cent of the
combatants were killed in that battie or died
from the effeets of it. When Hannibal engaged the Roman army in the battle cf
Cannoe, some 76,000 Roman soldiers teck part,
and after the fighting was ended 70,000 cf
them iay dead on the field. Now let us look
at some figures about the Waterloo campaign.
That cornes almost within our own ken, because when 1 went te sehool the textbooks
had a great deai to say about it. There were
mixed troops in that battle, the so-calied
English army consisting cf English and Dutch
soldiers, about 93,000 in ail. Approximately
60,000 cf these were British, and eut of that
number soine 15,000 were kiiled outright in
one day's fighting. That was in the main
engagement.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the honcurable gentleman where he got that information?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I obtained it from a
bock in the Library. If my honourabie friend
wishes 1 can let him know the source later.
For the time being 1 wili ask him te take my
figures as being fairiy accurate, as 1 think
they are. I usuaiiy do net make many mistakes in figures, but if I fail into any errer
at present 1 shahl apologize ister.
The number of French engaged in that
campaign was 124,000, and the casuaities
amounted te 45,000, or 36 per cent.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Docs that figureo
124,000 inciude the 40,000 troops under Marshal
de Grouchy, wbo were net near the field of
battie?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The fact is exactiy as I
have said, that there were 124,000 French
soldiers engaged at Waterloo. If my honourable friend wants me te state the total
number of troops, inciuding those who came

up too late to take part in the battle, I
will do so, but 1 do not want to clutter
up the record with unnecessary figures.
So intense was the fighting at Waterloo that
on an area three miles square 45,000 men
were kiiled or so seriousiy wounded that they
could net move without heip. These figures
give some idea of the carnage that went on
there.
Now 1 will go back to Fiodden Field, in
order to show what happened in that famous
encounter between the English and the Scotch.
Honourabie members wiil remember these
lines, deaiing with the return of Randolph
to Edinburgh:
Where are tbey, Our brothers-chjîdren?
Have they met the English fce?

And later on, as the city fathers were met
within the hall, the warrior replies:
"Till the oak that feul iast winter
Shail uprear its shfattered stemWives and mnothers of DunedinYe mnay look in vain for them!"
At tbe hattie of Bannockburn about 85 per
cent of the troops who took part in the fighting were killed or wounded. I arn giving these
figures -te show the humanity of present-day
warfare as compared with that of the past.
In the storming of Bunker Hill, at the time
cf the American Revolution, one eut of every
eleven British soidiers was killed. Now let
us take somne illustrations from the iast war.
Out of 16,500 Canadians who were engaged
in the flrst battie of Ypres, 4,000 were
woun(Ied and 2,000 kiiled. This was the most
costiy engagement in which Canadians took
part, the number killed being 12 per cent
of the participants. The figures I am quoting are from the officiai record, which 1 bave
here, and they refer oniy te our own troops.
At Vimy Ridge 81,000 Canadians were engaged, and out of this number 5 per cent,
or 4,500, were killed, and 9,000 wounded. At
Passchendaele 81,000 Canadians took part,
the samne number as at Vimy Ridge, and 5,500,
or six and one-haif per cent of the total were
kilied, and 11,000 wounded. In the whole
period of the war Canada had 600,000 men
overseas, and her total iosses, includrng the
*killed and those who died of wounds and
*accidents, and se on, were 60,000, or ten per
cent.

Hou. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I arn quating officiai
figures ai the number of civilians killed by
raids on London during the War. Compare
this number wîth the 33,000 killed in traffic
accidents in the United States during 1933.
Prophecies are made that poison gases will
wipe out whoie populations. We are toid that
these gases wili move like a blanket over the
countryside, killiing ail life, anirnal andi vegetable. As a matter af fact, most miiitary gases
can be seen in daytimne, and can be sineit
in daylight and dark before they are strang
enough ta be harmful. The rnost effective
military gases uow known were in general
-use at the end af the Warld War, and the
quantity of gas required ta do any very great
damage is s0 great as ta miinimize the sup~posed danger. It takes 300 pounds of phosgene ta gas an area of 100 square yards. In
.other words, 24,000,000 pounds of this gas
wauld be necessary ta caver the city af MontTeal and suburbs. To spread this amount ai
gas over Montreal would take approximate y
12,000 aeropianes, each carrying 2,000 pounds
of gas. There are scarceiy a suficient number
oi acroplanes of the proper type available
to-day ta spread this quantity of gas.
Cas is limited lu is use and in its effect.
Iu the late war, amang mare than 70,000 men
who were admitted ta haspital on account
ai gas injury, the deaths numbered 1,399,
or ouly 2 per cent. I do flot sugigest that
those affected by gas do not suifer. I arn
simply calling attention to, the fact that ouly
2 per cent of those gassed, died. The fact
is that as the impiements for kiliing are
improved. so are the meaus of protection. In
the aId days men fought -band ta hand with
axe, sword or bayanet, and in many cases
few survived. In sortie of the Scottish frays
the clans fought each other until there were
no survivr-aor noue able ta continue the
battle. In short, it was annihilation.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Iu those days there
were oniy a few meu engaged in the llghting.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: What is the difference if 100 per cent of them. are killed?
Hou. Mr. GRAHAM: One hundred per
cent killed might represent only one man
if there were but two belligerents.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: The figures I have
given illustrate very clearly my point, that
as time goes on war is more humane. In
the late War there was no intentionai devastation. In the old days the conqueror was
ruthiess, and even during the Napoleonic
wars the soldiers sacked towns and cities and
committed every conceivable âipredation.
To-day the saldier rareiy sees his enemy. He
fights fromn underground or from. behind
barricades. As the implements of war are
perfected so is the percentage af loss
decreased.
This is not a plea for war. On the contrary, I desire to a]Jay men's fears, and to
curtail this uni ustifiable taik and prophecy
of war.
The honourabie and galiant senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae) did flot, in
rny opinion, carreetly interpret the speech
of the right honourable gentleman who leads
this House (Right Hon. Mr. Meigihen). My
honourable and gallant. friend asserts that we
should notify Great Britain that we will withdraw from the League of Nations, and, further, that we will take no part in any
European wars in which Great Britain may
become invoived. This is an attitude with
which I cannot agree. It leads obviousiy ta
one conclusin-that Canada must compietely
separate itseif from the British Empire. I
am unabie ta accept or understand the theory
that the Empire can be at war and Canada
not 'be at war.
Han. Mr. CASCRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLAGK: This theory is incamprehiensible ta me. 8urely, if my armn
suffers, My whole body suffers. And so with
the Empire; if one part is at war, then the
whole Empire must of necessity be at war.
I can subscribe ta the principle that should
Great Britain voiuntariiy participate in a
European war for the sake of the preservation af some of the smalier nations, Canada
shouid, not be asked ta participate without
first determiniug the mind of hier citizens
through Parliarnt or by a plébiscite. Sa
long as the cause is just and the Empire is
fighting for its existence, its ideais and its
hanour, then mnust every part of the Empire
participate. W.hen I bear in mind the attitude assumed by Canada at the time af the
South African War aud af the late War, I
arn eatisfied that should any part of the
Empire be uni ustly attacked, the respanse
from Canada wouid be as euthusiastic and as
spontaneous as it was in 1914. Layai Canadians of ail languages and creeds would rush
ta enlist for bier defence.

at any price. No nation ever became great
that was flot prepared to flght for its rights;

its honour and its place in the world. The

and similar slhh'v sentimental pacificism will,
if accepted iand imbibed by our youth, lead
to a spineless and feeble nation-a nation
which will become fair game for the first

Lot us consider for a moment the position

Canada is nlot at war if and whon the Empire

Either annihilation by one of the eastern
powers to xvhich I have referred, or the
humiliation of having to ask our noighhours

True, this wvould ho proferable to the alternative. But what would if involvo? In the
firsf place, we should haveo separated ourselves
from the British Crown. What thon would
become of the British North America Act?
We should have no Constitution. Certainly if
we ever f ook the vory unlikely stop of witbdrawing from the British Empire, we should
necessarily become a part of the UJnited States.
In that, ev ont, 'honourable gentlemen, lot

about provincial rights?
How about dual

aware that there are more people of French
descent in the five northeastern States than
in the whole province of Quehec? In addition, there are more than 2.000,000 French
descendants in the States through which flows
the Mississippi river. Those people have no
separate sehools, no dual languege, rights; in
short, they enjoy none of the privileges we
enjoy in Canada. I was surprised to find fromn

Canadians had moved jnto the United States,
andl that 471,605 immigrants had cnfered from
France. From a sfudy of these figures 1 gather
that thecre are at present 8.577,000 Frenchsppaking people in the United States.
Some Canadians are not very favourably
disposed towards the Cerman people. It may
surprise honourable members f0 ho informed
that during the War it was officially cstimated
thore were about 17,000,000 Gormans in the
United States.
I mention these figures se that those who

what would happen f0, us in this event. These

bas flot been in the o'ther braneb of Parliament for sorne time as full and tborough a
discussioin on the League of Nations and on
world problemns as has recently taken place
in this House. I arn of the opinion tbat if
the other branch of Parliament pays littie
attention to the League of Nations and to
wvorld questions of higb importance to Canada
as a nation, we in tbis Chamber can very well
devote some time and attention to foreign
affairs. Therefore, if there were no other
reason, I would offer my warmest commendation to the bonourable senator froin Vancouver for bringing thîs question forward, because in discussîng it we may arouse among
the people of -Canada some interest as to wbat
the League of Nations really means, a desire
to learn bow Canada stands in relation to tbe
rest of the world, and an appreciation of
wbetber we may or may not be involved in
war. I amn of tbe opinion that if there is to
be a war Canada may very well be involveal
in it. Thereforo, it is my desire to support
sometbing that will enable Canada, and, if
possible, the world itscif, to avoid war.
The terrible nature of war bas been referred

tbink the real meaning of the Great War
couki be better expressed than it was recently
in a speech delivered by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, Princiýpal of Columbia University,

of American tbought who supported tbe
League cf Nations at a time wben it was
rnost unpopular in the United States. In
poin'ting out that more than four bundred
billions' wortb of property bad been swept
away during the Great War, he made this
statement:

In referring to that statemeint I arn not
attempting to criticize the honourable senator country. lIt strikes me that as an argument
fromn Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McR-ae) for bring- against war that statement cannot be sur-

as bias already been pointed out by others
who bave taken part in this de-bate, satisfactorily settled the Aland Islands dispute between Sweden and Finland., the PolishLithuanian dispute over Vila, the PolishGerman dispute over Upper Silesia, the
Franco-Britis-h dispute on the question of the
nationality decree-s in Tunis, and the Aibanian
boundary.
I have already referred to the good work
the League bas done in suppressing illicit
traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs,
and the slave traffic, also in guarding the welfare of chikiren andl young people, and in
pre'venting andl controllýing disease.
That much money is wasted I believe is
true. But, after ail, substantial resu]ts are
being obtained, and I suggest that i place of
advocating the abolition of the League it
would be More to the point to use our efforts
towards bringing into the organization that
nation whose one-time President is said to
have originated the idea of the League, as
well as those nations whiclh, once being members,' have since dropped out. That the League
bias not corne up to the expectations of its
entbusiasts is certain, but it bias done some
good. It is the only international macbinery
we have, an'd 1 would urge that until something better is available we continue our
membersbip. Furthermore, I submit, until
Great Britain as the Mother of the Empire
decides she will no longer retain membership, it is our duty to stay by the Empire
and not sever our connection with an organization that at least has done some good.
Let us k'eep peace wîtb bonouýr, but let us
also be reasonably ready to meet aggression.

Apart from the question of Canada's debt,
which came about so largely by reason of
our participation in the War-and I am not
criticizing that participation-we
have a
problem which I think can be blamed largely,
if not entirely, on the War and the situation
resulting from it. I refer lo the difficulty of
marketing our wheat. The best authority I
can quote to support my argument in this
connection is the Prime Minister. I recall
very well that on his return fron the
Economie Conference he delivered before
the Montreal Board of Trade an address in
which he pointed out that there was a
tendency on the part of the governments of
the countries of Europe which feared war to
encourage the people to raise enough foodstuffs to make them self-sustaining and independent of the rest of the world. If that
policy was encouraged because of the fear of
war, it is but another reason why Canada
should very seriously consider the question of
war and the likelihood of this country again
being involved in it.
The honourable senator from Vancouver,
speaking in the debate on the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne, made this
statement:
I cannot conceive of any developments wbich
would justify this country in sacrificing the
blood of one single Canadian on the future
battle-fields of Europe.
I do net want any Canadians te sacrifice
their lives on the battle-fields of Europe,
South Africa, or any continent; but I can
conceive of a situation arising in which Canadians would be forced to make such a sacrifice.
Why (o I say that? We belong to the
British Commonwealth of Nations, and no
matter what we may think, no matter what
position we may take in regard to a war in
which Great Britain is involved, we of ourselves could not prevent a foe of Great
Britain from attacking this country if it were
thought tbat such action would undermine or
help to destrov Great Britain. For instance, if
Great Britain were engaged in war with one
of the countries of the Orient, and that
country were powerful enough to strike at our
western coast, it would do so in order to
cripple and harm Great Britain. I see the
possibility of a similar development if Great
Britain were engaged in war in Europe. I
am net saying there is any such danger at the
moment; but uniless there is some method of
bringing about a peacefuil understanding
between nations, there is the possibility of a
return te the secret diplomacy and entangling
Iln. Mr. BUCHANAN.

alliances of pre-war days. Such a condition
might very easily bring Great Britain into
a struggle with some nation of the world that
would, if the opportunity arose, strike at
Canada in order te defeat Great Britain.
Could we then keep out of war?
I-t is largely for that reason tiat I feel
this country should not, at this time at any
rate, support any movement that seeks to
break up the collective system, the aim of
which is to solve the problems or the differences of nations by peaceful rather than by
warlike methods.
That system was very
effectively explained in a recent issue of
Interdependence, the organ of the League of
Nations Society in Canada, and it appeals
to me as the only system that can be adopted
in this world to prevent the possibility of
war.
The "Collective System" is the name that is
coming to be used for the international organization of secur-ity and peace. Its principles
are those of the League of Nations, namely,
co-operation between nations, and the use of
judicial methods of arbitration for the settlement of disputes between nations.
Those who believe in the "Collective System"
method believe that the relations between
nations should be similar to the relations
between individuals in a national society.
because the world is now so closely bound
together by trade, communication, and the
creations of modern science, that it has become
a single society itself. In one society, war is
disastrous for the whole. Human beings have
set up police, courts. judges. to enforce and
uphiold the law equally for all individuals in

the state, and assault and violence are treated
and punished as crimes.
This is possible
because the members of society collectively
support the enforcement of law and are willing
to pay taxes to maintain it, and subiit to it
when they bring their differences before it.
In the samue way, the individuals in the
world society, that is. the nations who compose
that society, must collectively agree (if assault
and violence, i.e. war, are to be stopped from
breaking out from time to time to upset trade,
destroy property and retard progress) to obey
a cocimon law and to subnit their disputes to
its courts and jurisdiction.
The collective system, which is the basis
of the League of Nations, is one that I think
appeals to the majority of the people of the
world. It appeals net only to those who have
never actually been engaged in war, but also
to those who have been engaged in it or have
suffered from it. I recall that at the recent
annual convention of the Canadian Legion
in Ottawa a very strong resolution was passed
in support of the League of Nations. Those
men, returned soldiers who had taken part in
the Great War and do not want any more
war, think the only means of bringing about
understanding between nations and preventing the possibility of war is the League of
Nations.

MAY 8, 1934
Now I want to make some reference to
what, by reason of the withdrawal of Japan
and Germany, appeared to be a breaking up
of the League of Nations, and to quote from
the Manchester Guardian an editorial whioh
is really a condensation of a speech delivered
recently by Lord Cecil. I think it explains
the cause of indifference towards -the League
of Nations, and, coming from Lord Cecil,
one of the great advocates of the League
from the very beginning, it is worth heeding.
This is what the Manchester Guardian says:
Lord Cecil, who presided yesterday over a
national conference in defence of the League
of Nations, wisely observed that recent attacks
on the League had been ultimately of considerable service to it. They have roused not
only professional statesmen but ordinary men
and women throughout Europe to restate their
conviction that the way of the League is the
sole alternative to the bad old-fashioned plan
of the rule of force. Why bas the League
fallen into discredit? Some may speafç of the
failure to treat Japan as an aggressor when
she wantonly seized Manchuria from China and
then lef t Geneva.
Others will emphasize
Hitler's decision to leave the League, undoubtedly largely inspired hy the success of Japan's
impudence. But in the last analysis it is. as
Lord Cecil said, the failure of those nations
which have given the greatest amount of lipservice to, League- principles to make adequate
use of the machiinery provided for them that
lies at the root of the evil.
The Leagune
conests of nothin more than the States that
compose it. A bad workabamsisoos
and so perhaps does an unwilling workman.
I should be very sorry indeed to see this
Chaxuber make any declaration that Canada
should leave the League of Nations, and
thereby contribute to the arguments of tho-se
nations that desire the break-up of the League
and a return to the old system.
There is, in connection with the League
of Nations, another point tbat I think is
important to Canada as a member of the
British Commonwealth. Every time the representatives of this country go to Geneva they
corne into contact not only with the representatives of other nations of the world,' but
also with their fellow representatives fromn
other parts of the Commonwealth, and usually
with the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain.
That. as I see it, helps to meet the point
%,ery properly raised by the honourable senstor from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) when
he said:
If Great Britain, by secret treaty or otherwise. should guarantee security to France, or
make a coalition with any other continental
country or group, and a war should come about
in which Britain must participate, have we no
voice as to what Canada should do about it?
Many of our citizens think we muet fight if
Britain is at war. If that is so, should we
flot have something to say, at the time they
are being negotiated, about the treaties, coali74728-23

353

tions, or agreements which obligate us to fight?
Yet where is the Canadian to-day who would
advocate that Canada should sign any treaty
or join any coalition which promises to involve
us in a European war?
Keeping in mind that there is always a
pos.sibility of war, an.d of Canada being involved when Great Britain is at war, I feel
that inasmuch as the League of Nations
enables us to meet our fellow members of the
Commonwealth a.nd the representatives of the
Government of Great Britain at Geneva, the
League offers us and the other members of
the Commonwealth an opportunity of communicating to the Government of Great
Britain our views and feelings in regard to
ber foreign policy. If we were to leave such
matters to the Imperial Conferences, which
are held more or less irregularly, we might
be too late; but at lest once every year
some memnber of the Government of Canada
meets in Geneva the members of the governments of the British Dominions and of
Great Britain, and surely he ought to he able
to sound out the Foreign Secretary and learn
something of the ideas of Great Britain and
the problems of the world. In that way we
should be aible to wield am influence upon
Great Britain with respect to ber policy towards the other nations of the world.
While it may be true that 'the people of
Canada have not in past years, when conditions were prosperous, given serious thought
to the League of Nations, I believe the maj oriýty of them. are in sympathy with what it
represents. I-t may not have fulfilled its purpose; in many respects it has nlot; but I
think that its ideal is the ideal of the maj ority of the people of Canada. and that they
would not at this time support any move to
leave it, and thus give the countries of the
world further arguments against it. If this
question should come to a vote, honourable
members, you will understand from what I
have said that I am opposed to Canada's
withdrawal from membership in the League
of Nations.

Mr. TURGEON.

House of Commons Bill which is in oui hands
for consideration. It would ot bc given the
Royal Assent this week in any event; so if
we postponed consideration until the npxt
sitting of the House there would be no time

lcst.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I understand that only
two days a week, Mondav and Fridav, are
now being allotted to private buis in the
Huse of Commons. Therefore, if this meas-

MAY 9,1934
ure is flot considered here to-day, and if the
Senate adj ourns until Tuesday, the Bill could
not be referred back to the Gommons for
final consideration until a week from Friday.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The sponsor
of the Bill outside the House has told meI do flot know whetber hie wants it mentioned
or not-that some special reason makes it
necessary to proceed with -the organization of
work under this Bill before the l5th of the
presenit month. I cannot inf*orm the House
just what that reaison is. On this account I
should like ta have the amendments discussed now. Recause of *our intention ta
adjourn from to-day until Tuesday night,
and because of the practice now obtaining in
another place, the passage of this Bill will
be delayed much past the middle of the
month if we fail ta deal with the amendments one way or another now. Theref are,
unless my honourable friend opposite has
some special reasan for objecting, it is important that we should proceed witb consideration now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I withdraw my
objection.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The principal amendment is to provide that after the
Governor in Council has approved of the
general financial scheme, and before any work
can be begun, the company must get the
approval of the Railway Commission by way
of a certificate that the company bas enough
money to finish the undertaking. Sa far as
I know, no provision of this kind has ever
before been included in any such bill. This
precautionary measure, as I suppose it is
called, seems ta be entirely new, and I shauld
think that the House could discuss the merits
of it naw as well as at any other time.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is no harm
in such an amendment. It is just like placing
a plaster on a wooden leg, because a structure of the kind cantemplated could not be
built without the approval of the Railway
Board in any event. And bef are the company
can build the bridge it must get permission
from the Government of -Ontario, because the
bottom of the river belongs ta that province.
We had such matters up before in connection
with Beauharnois.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The hionouraible senator has missed the point. Certainly the R.ailway Commission's approval
of the structure would be necessary, but this
amendment provides that the campany cannot go ahead with its work until the Commission bas declared that the campany is
financially capable of completing the work.
74728-23 J

355

That is entirely outside the usual purview
of the Commission.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think that is a
proper amendinent.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I moved the
amendment before the standing committee.
I am informed that complementary legislation
bas been passed by Congress and by the
Legislatures of New York State and the province of Ontario. I am not greatly impressed
by the information.
The company to be incorparated by this
Bill will have an authorized capital stock of
50,000 shares of a par value of $10 each.
This wauld provide a capital of $500,000. The
estimated cost of the Canadian end of the
bridge is said ta be $1,500,000.
It seems to me that in its financial set-up
this Bill is similar ta other bridge bills that
have so aften engaged aur attention. A graup

the
bondsý-the investing public of Canada-wihl
build the bridge. If there is any profit to be
derived from the enterprise the group of
promoters will packet it, but if it proves a
failure the bondholders will suifer by repudiation of their bonds.
The Bible cbaraoterizes as tbe most foolish
man in the world the persan who began ta,
build a bouse witbout havîng the wherewitbal
ta complete it. We have many examples of
warks begun and through lack of funds neyer
carried ta completion. An outstanding failure
was the attempt of DeLesseps ta build a
canal across the Isthmus of Panama. Millions
and millions of francs were squandered.
Curiously enough, somne years ago an abortive
attempt was made ta build a bridge in the
neighbourhoad of the site now proposed.
Concrete abutments and rusty macbinery are
grim re-minders of the failure.
Lt is the duty of Parliament ta protect the
investing publie against this sort of tbing.
The question is, how should we go about it.
It was proposed at first to amend the Bill
by requiring the promoters ta satisfy the
Governor in Council that tbey had sufficient
capital ta carry the proposed work ta comnpletion, but a representative from the Department of Justice did not tbink it proper ta
impose this duty on Council. Then I suggested tbe matter should be left ta the decision of the Board of Raîlway Commissioners.
It may be tbat the Buard bas no jurisd-iction.
I am not particular as ta wbat authority shall

capitalization is sufficient te warrant the commencement of the work. Truc, section 12
provides that the Governor in Council may
pass upon the financial set-up. This safeguard is all very well so far as it goes, but
my amendment would make it impossible for
the promoters te proceed with the bridge
until they had furnished satisfactory evidence
of having sufficient funds in hand te complete
the work. By insisting on such an amendment net only shall we prevent the ugly
spectacle of an unfinisled structure, but, what
is more important, we shall give the unfortunate-or perhaps fortunate-purchasers of
the bonds a "run for their money."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The first amendment, as I heard it read by the Chairman,
contemplates referring te the Board of Railway
Commissioners the question whether this company is financially able te put through the
project te be authorized. I am in full sympathy with the desire te safeguard investors.
But can we confer on the Board a jurisdiction
net contemplated by the Railway Act?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In view of
the suggestion that these amendments be considered now, I think they should be considered
in Committee of the Whole. Therefore, by
way of amendment te the motion, I move that
the House resolve itself into Committee of the
Whole.
The arnendment iwas agreed te.

the following as subelause 2:
(2) The construction of the said bridge shall
not be eornmenced unless and until the Conpany
has satisfied the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada that it is financially capable
of carrying out and completing the whole of the
work in accordance with the plans approved by
the Governor in Couneil.
Right Hon. Geo. P. GRAHAM: A question
has arisen as te the competency of the Board
of Railway Commissioners to deal with the
financial capacity of the bridge company. My
own view is that the Board would be fully
justified in declining tu act, on the ground that
the implied power is net within the scope of
the Railway Act.
The site of the proposed bridge is in the
locality from which the honourable senator
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) -and J corne.
The uncompleted bridge mentioned by mny
honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) is net near the locality referred to;
it is opposite the property of my honourable
friend from Leeds. Two or three abutrnents
were erected, but the company then suspended
operations for lack of capital.
I have had some experience in regard to
financing the construction of bridges. Some
$20,000 te $25,000 was expended on -a projected
bridge just west of Brockville. It will be
readily understood that under the proposed
amendment the bridge company would have te
sell bonds even te get sufficient money to
carry out the surveys and prepare the prelirninary and the final plans for approval by the
Government. Now, a company cannot very
well sell bonds until it knows what it is te sell
them for. It strikes me that with respect
te a bridge estirnated te cost only 81,500,000
the investing public would be sufficiently safeguarded by the provision for approval of the
plans by the Governor in Council. It is not
an easy matter at the present time to finance
undertakings of this kind, and in my opinion
the proposed amendment would greatly
hamper the bridge company. The Brockville
bridge that we had in mind was a much more
pretentious structure and would have cost
$8,000,000 te $12,000,000.
The bridge as located would be constructed
from the Canadian side te a Canadian island;
the central span, as I see it in my mind's
eye, would extend thence to the first American island, this being the international section;
the last span would be wholly in United
States territory.

MAY 9,1934
I arn strongly in favour of protecting the
investing public at ail times, but by adopting
this amendment we may destroy ail possibility of the oompany financing the Canadian
section of the bridge ta the extent of $1,500,000. I do flot think the amencLment means
much after ail.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: I was able ta attend
t.he Standing Gommittee on Miscellaneous
Private Bis for only a short time. As I
understand, -the proposed bridge wil be in
three sections. The first section will extend
from the Canadian aide ta the island adi oinîng the international section, and is ta cost
$1,500,000; the middle or international section extends across sixty feet of almoat dead
water to the island on the American side;
the third section connecta this -island with the
mainland on the United States side. The
estimated cost of this part is also 31,500,000.
I arn not sure whether the cost of the amaîl
central span ia included in this figure.
Hon. ýG. V. WHITE: It is included.
Hon. Mr. BLACK. In any event the coat
would not be very great. To judge by experience of the actual coat of bridgea an the
St. Lawrence, this estimated coat of $3,000,000
is likely ta be subatantially exceeded. Investors who have bought tunnel and bridge
bonds have been 'rather badly disappointed.
The bonda of the Detroit and Windsor Tunnel
Company are quoted to-day at $7, but it ýis
daubtful whether there is a market for them.
Canadians put their money into that company
on the strength of legislation similar to this
Bill. 1 arn ail in favour of safeguarding
Canadýian investors in international bridgea,
in order, if possible, ta prevent further lasses.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: I voted against the
proposed amendment, in the standing committee for this reason. I understand that
for two hundred miles ta the west and for
flfty miles ta the eaat of the proposed site
there is no bridge accommodation. O.nly the
other day we had a pretty eloquent speech
from the honourable member fram Halifax
(Hon. Mr.DTennis), paintiniz out the value of
touriat traffic and urging that stepa be taken
ta encourage it ta the fullest possible extent.
Well, I do not know any better way of encouraging tourist traffic than by building a
bridge. The Canadian section is estimated
ta coat only $1,500,000. We are not concerned with the cost of the American aection.
I reneat. 1 knowv nn better wav of encauraging tourist traffic than by building a bridge
of thia kind and making the country accessible
ta the thickly populated State of New York,

357

bordering on the St. Lawrence. I cannot
understand why obstacles should be thrown in
the way of a scheme of this kind when there
is sa much unemnployment in the country.
Construction of the bridge would mean work
for a considerable number of men and the use
of a great deal of structural material. I certainly think this amendment ahould be defeated. I was told in the committee that
neyer 'befare had a clause of this kind been
put into sucb a bill.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I want ta touch principally upon the point
referred ta hy my honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbaeh), namely the
security of the shareholders.
The Peace
Bridge coxnpany at Fort Erie fell into a state
of practical insolvency and had ta be reorganized; and the Detroit-Windsor Bridge
company bas been in financial trouble for a
good many years. I do not know anything
about the people who are behind this Thousand Islands Bridge projeet. While I arn not
very enthusiastie about a bridge of this kind,
I would rather support than oppose it, but
I feel that the investing public should be
protected. This amendment provides that
the financial set-up *of the company must
be approved by the Railway Board, and I
should like honourable senators ta consider
whether if that were done it wauld be used
as a bait for investors. Will the members
of this company say that the financial set-up
has been practically approved by the Government of Canada? We know that there
are companies of other kinda whose financial
structure is subjeet ta certain Government
approval, and they ail hold themaselves out
ta the publie as having been approved, if
not guaranteed, by the Government.
Like the honourable senatar from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), I sbould flot care
ta see a bridge of this kind started and lef t
uncompleted because of insufficient capital,
or its operation discontinued -through lack of
ample fluid assets. A million and a haîf of
dollars is a very considerable sum. Without
doubt the bonds wiIl be fioated largely i.
eastern Ontario, a district in which I amn
greatly interested. I feel that we should be
very careful in protecting the public from
getting -the idea that the 'bonds of a company
such as this are a safe investment because
the financial set-up has been approved by the
Government or a Government commission.
Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honaurable senators,
I supported the amendment in committee this
morning. At first it was suggested that the
Governor in Cauncil shauld pasa upon the
financial statua of this company bef are it be

SENATE

358

allowed to proceed with the work, and then
it was decided to require instead the approval
of the Railway Commission. I supported the
amendment because I firmly believed that the
right honourable leader of the Government
would rise in the House and say it is ridiculotis that a Government commission should
be asked to pass on the financial standing of
the company. I think the amendment goes
altogether beyond our field. Furthermore, as
has been pointed out, losses have been incurred on bonds issued in connection with the
construction of other bridges. That fact
should be sufficient warning to the investing
public. I do not think this House should pass
such an amendment, for it would likely interfere with the carrying on of a public work
which would give employment that is badly
needed at the present time.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, there are certain laws and regulations
governing the Board of Railway Commissioners in Canada. Again I ask, can we give
to that Board the authority and right to ascertain whether this bridge company is financially
capable of carrying out its project? Is it not
likely that if this amendment were passed
the Board would decline to act in accordance
with it, and would say that it already bas
troubles enough of the kind it was created to
handle? Might we not just as well allocate
this job to the Grain Board or to the Unemployment Commission? Has the Board of
Railway Commissioners any power to undertake such a job?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: If the Bill were passed
with this amendment there would be an Act
of Parliament giving the Board the necessary
power.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
gentleman says that there would be an Act
of Parliament giving the Board certain authority. But as I understand it--and I am
asking for information-the functions and
duties of the Board are defined in the law
which created it. There are a number of
honourable memibers here who know more
about the subject than I do, and I should
like to be told whether this amendment is
something that can be made effective or is
simply a gesture of protection for some people
from financial exploitation. I am ail in favour
of protecting the public against financial exploitation, but I cannot see why the job of
providing the protection should be allocated to
the Railway Board any more than to the
Grain Board or the Unemployment Commission.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I will say a few words first on the
point raised by the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) and referred
to and indeed largely answered by the right
honourable senator from Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham).
Certainly Parliament
could in this or any other Act add to the
powers of the Railway Commission by authorizing that body to pass upon the financial
ability of the company to complete the construction of the bridge. But I agree with the
right honourable senator from Eganville that
the amendment does not vest in the Board
the power to express its satisfaction with the
company's financial ability. The Board might
say that impliedly it has that right, but I
think that Parliament should not ask it to
rest upon so slender a foundation. If we are
going to move at ail in the direction of the
proposed amendment, we should go farther
and expressly give the Board that power.
In any event it would probably ask for such
power before it would act.
From this point on my remarks will be
based on the assumption that we have invested the Board with the necessary authority.
The question then is whether the amendment
is a wise one. Some honourable members
have argued that it is intended to protect
the public who will be asked to subscribe to
the bond issue. We have been told that the
purchasers of bonds on two similar enterprises,
the Peace Bridge at Fort Erie and the DetroitWindsor Bridge, lost their money or a large
part of it. But I ask honourable members to
reflent upon this question. Suppose such an
amendment as we have here had applied to
those projects, would it have protected a
single bondholder?
The answer is that it
would not have afforded the slightest protection, because the companies had secured ail
the money that was necessary to build the
bridges.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I interrupt the
right honourable gentleman? If at the time
those securities were issued there had been
a law similar to this proposed amendment, it
would have had the effect of assuring the
public that the companies would not proceed
with the undertakings until they had enough
money on band to complete them. And in
my opinion the companies would have sold
more stock and in that way increased their
actual working capital, so that stockholders
would have been responsible, in part at least,
for the building of the bridges. But what
happened was that the people who bought
the bonds paid the cost of construction, and
the promoters put in virtually no money of

MAY 9, 1934
their own, or a t most a sumn so small as to
be insignifloant.
Undoubtedly what the proposer of this
amendment has in mind is protection to investors. That is what I have in mind. If
the amîendinent does not give that, let us
substitute another. At ail events let us put
into this Bill, and into every measure of the
kind, some provision that will, so far as is
possible, preven.t further exploitation of the
public through the sale of bonds on these
bridge proj ects.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: What my honourable friend wants is absolute protection for
the investor.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No, but I want to prevent exploitation.
Right Hýon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn afraid
the honourable gentleman has missed the
point. What I said was that had this provision been in the buis authorizing the construction *of the other bridges mentioned, it
would flot have given any protection to a
single bondholder, for the provision is
simply that before any work is begun the
Railway Board must be satisfied thaýt the
cornpany is financially capable of cornpleting
the structure. In the two instances that have
been mentioned the companies did have sufficient money, and they did build the structures. The amendment does not provide that
the money, or any proportion of it, shahl be
raised among stockholders; it makes no reference whatever to the source of the funds.
Consequently, had this provision been in
effeet in those two instances, the bondholders
would have been in exactly the saine position
as they in fact were.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Not quite, I
think. The total arnount of money required
wouhd be stated at the inceptionRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
In those
other cases the companies had the total
arnount of money required.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: When a coinpany launches such a project it estimates
construction costs and income, and the public
invests on that basis. But if the estimate of
costs is too low and more bonds have te be
sold to complete the bridge, the inoome on
the bonds that were sold first is likely to be
much less than the investors calculated. This
arnendment is not designed to protect shareholders against losses in operation s0 much
as to ensure that the structure as contemplated will be completed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is all.
If the honourable gentleman had kept to the
point I arn on hie would not have made the

explanation, because it does not affect the
situation at all. So far as the other comnpanies are concerned, they had not merely a
part of, but ahl the money required to coinplete the works before construction was coinmenced. Therefore, had this arnendment been
in effect at that time, the saine bases would
have occurred that did occur.
If we are endeavouring to protect investors,
ýis this the proper way te go about it? It
seerns te me that it is not, for the amendment would nlot protect anyone. 1 do not sec
how we could give the publie any greater
protection than is afforded by legislation such
as is in effect in Ontario and the West, and
I think also, in Quebec. The Security Fraud
Prevention Act of Ontario provides that
people who sell securities must disclose in
connection therewith the facto, the whole facto
and nothing but the facts, and in such a way
that thie dullest person may understand them.
I do flot see how we can go further than that
unless we aim to guarantee the safety of investmnents, by placing upon securities the
imprimatur of the Governor in Council or the
Railway Commission or somne other body
which would be regarded by the public as
equally responsible in the event of any dlaim
for losses. Rather than support this amendment I would vote against the Bill in toto,
because I think the effect of the amendment
would be a roi.mdabout balkîng of the bridge
projeet. Suppose an investment banldng heuse
were asked to underwrite the bonds for this
company and seIl them. to the public. Would
it be likely to do so when it did not know
what the attitude of the Railway Commission would be?
I do nlot think that the Railway Commission has the machinery to enable it to estimate what the bridge would cost. Other
honourable rnembers of this House are better
informed than I about that. As the honourable senator fromn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) says, the statute which created the
Board did flot provide for work of this kind.
0f course the company would come under
regulations of the Railway Commission in
the construction and operation of the bridge,
but it seems te me that te ask -the Commission to decide how much money would be
necessary foir the building of a structure across
the St. Lawrence river, and to satisfy itself
that the necessary money is in the oompany's
treasury before ainy work is undertaken, is to
ask it to invade a field in which it is not
equipped to operate. If the amendment we
passed it wiouhd siniply be a notice to any investment banking house flot to underwrite

SENATE
the issue of the company's bonds, and therefore the project would never be carried on.
I am not a member of the Committee which
considered this Bill and I have not given
enough study to the measure to speak with
authority on the point that is in the mind
of the honourable senator from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Black). But it seems to me that
if we want to meet his point we should provide for a larger capital structure. I do not
know whether the total sum to be protected
by the $500,000 capital stock provided for
here is $1,500,000.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: It is $2,000,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If it is only
$1,500,000, the measure of protection is much
larger than is usually given, for $500,000 would
have to be lost before the bondholders would
suffer. But if $3,000,000 of bonds are to be
secured by only $500,000 of stock, the margin
of security is much smaller and perhaps
further protection should be given. But in
this respect also there is a responsibility resting upon the provincial authorities, and within
this responsibility the company must come by
virtue of the terms of the Bill. The provincial
authorities can authorize or forbid the cornpany to sell bonds. I suggest that we should
leave the responsibility to them and should
not seek to place it upon any federal authority. If it be felt that, aside from the provincial responsibility, we should provide, by
way of an increase of stock, a larger margin
of safety for the bondholders, the Bill might
be referred back to the standing committee
for further consideration. But the amendment
is not only futile, it is destructive of the
whole purpose of the Bill, and if we do not
think the project satisfactory we should be
doing our duty more manfully by rejecting
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not see anything
in the Bill to indicate that the capital stock
must be paid up.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps it
should be; but that is another point entirely.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: In my opinion a capitalization of $500,000, subscribed but not paid
up, is no guarantee to back a bond issue of
$1,500,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should think
that under the Security Fraud Prevention
Act the Provincial Government could require
the capital to be paid up. Perhaps it should
be paid up. But that is entirely aside from
the amendment. It appears to me that the
$500,000 capitalization is protection against the
Rfight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Canadian end. Only the Canadian company
can issue bonds under this legislation, and it
alone gets the benefits of the stock subscription. It would seem to me to be a fair statement of the case that the holders of bonds to
whatever amount may be required for the
Canadian construction will have the benefit
of being protected to the extent of the subscription, or, if we insist on the capital being
paid up, to the amount of $500,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It may interest the
right honourable gentleman who leads the
House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) to know
how the Royal Engineers in England award
contracts. They do not necessarily give the
contract to the lowest bidder; they give it to
the contractor who can furnish a guarantee
from two solvent companies that he is financially able to proceed with the work.
A
clause along similar lines would in this instance afford protection to the investing
public.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I move that the
amendment be stricken out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: During the
course of this discussion I have been more
and more impressed with the wisdom of having the standing committee again deal with
the Bill. It is not the usual practice to refer
a bill back on the motion for third reading,
but I do not see why it should not be done
in this case. It may be that the standing committee will be able to put the Bill into a more
acceptable shape with reference to the financial relationship between stockholders and
bondholders.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As the mover of
the amendment in the standing committee I
accept the proposal. I appreciate that the
weakness of the amendment lies in the reference to the Board of Railway Commissioners.
The Bill, however, contains a number of references to the Railwav Act, and at the time it
struck me that the Railway Board would be as
good a body as any to deal with the matter.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It may be that
the Board of Railway Commissioners was
mentioned because it has been the practice
to refer to it in bills authorizing the construction of bridges to carry railway as well
as vehicular traffic. Those bills were always
dealt with by the Railway Committee.

amendment under consideration, I am agreeable to the suggestion of the right honourable

0f these only 42,000 were

into action from 60.000 to 70,000.
With r9spect f0 the final stage of the campaign, which wvas on the l7th, my honourable

fact that there was one distinct battle when
Napoleon attacked Blucher at Charleroi, and

of Waterloo was fought on the field of that
namp. In that engagement the forces under
Wellington tot.alled 68,000 odd, and those

that at Hal there were 20,000 men on Wellington's righit rear, but they were not on the

BILLS 0F EXCHANGE

BILL

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
second reading of Bill 37, an Act to amend
the Bills of Exchange Act.
Ho said: Honourable senators, this Bill
provides that "Remembrance Day" be substituted for "Armistice Day" in the list of
legal hiolidays, and that civic holiday in any
municipality shahl be observed au a legal
holiday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
WVe have ahready quite a number of holidays, Dominion
and provincial. This Bill would add to the
list any day which is declared a civic hioliday
by resolution of the counicil of any municipality. On such a hioliday the hanka would be
uloau'd.
I du nut know whether this point
was mentioned in the other House, but I
should like to ask my right honourable friend
whether there has been any general request
for such legislation, and whether he thinks
the legislation is desirable. Parliament lias
created certain holidays, and so have the
provinces. Now this Bill provides that
In any cify, town, municipality or other
organized district, any day appointed as a civic
holiday by îes-olution of the counicil, or other
statutory body charged with the administration
of the civic or municipal affairs of the city,
town. nîuuuicipality or districtshahl he observed as a legal hioliday. Would
this not lead f0 considerable difficulty in
connoction with hills of exehange that happen
to faîl due on civic holidays?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
I rend the
brief discussion that took place in the other
Huse, and it did not touch upon the point
raised by the honourable gentleman. A civic
holiday may be declared by the municipal
council or other statutory body charged with
the administration of municipal affairs, and
the difficulty to which my honourable friend
refers is (tue fo the fact that the holiday
does not faîl upon the same date ail over the
country. For instance, Montreal's civic holiday may be on a different date from that of
Toronto; Winnipeg may choose another date,
Brockville another, and so on. A bill may be
drawn at one place and faîl due at another,
and if in that other place the due date happons t.o be civic holiday, the bill is not legally
due until the next day. So this proposed
provision might give Tise to considerable
uncertainty in the minds of business mon as
to just when a bill would be payable. The
point appears to me to have some force, but
s0 far as I am aware there was no discussion
on if in the other place.

363

MAY 9, 1934
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN'D: No, there was
none. Could we not, postpone further consideration of the Bill until next week, in order
that in the meantime we might inquire frein
boards of trade and other organizations
whethcr they desired to express an opinion?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Ib xnay
be well to state the case now from another
viewpoint. When a civie holiday is declared
in any municipality it is advisable that it
should apply to ail the citizens, 'but in the
absence of such a provision as this it would
be necessary for 'banks to remain open in order
that bis falling due on that day might be
paid. 'There are a large number of persans
working in banks, and if this Bill were passed
they would be able to take advantage of civic
holidýay in common with ail other citizens.
On the general question of holidays I must
admit that my views have undergone a change
in recent times. I do not think that an
increase in holidays the worlýd over would have
a bad effect, though I1 once believed to the
contrary. Holidays really have the effect of
lesseninýg the number of working hours, and
the result is that work is distributed among a
larger number of persans. But thîs argument
does not deal with the question raised by
my honourable friend opposite, that the passing of the Bill as it stands might cause considerable complications .with respect to the
payment of bills maturing on civic holidays.
which are held on different dates in different
municipalities. I have no objection whatever
to the third reading bcing postponed until next
week, and in the meantime I shaîl endeavour
to ascertain the views of boards of trade and
banks on the question.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Surely there is no
necessiby for delaying the passage of this Bill.
I assume that the abject of tbe measure is
uniformiby. Apparently the honourable, leader
on this aide (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) did not
read the explanatory note, which says:
Paragraph d je new and desipned to permit
the closýing of bank offices on civie holidays. In
bhe absence of euch provision, bille falling due
on a eivic holidey woud -have to be paid on
that day.
Surely that shows the object is to establish
uniformity so 'that on -civie holiday in any
municipality bank employees may in common
with other persons be free, and bills falling
due on that day may flot be payable until the
next day.
But I would
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
point out to my honourable friend that bbc
Bill would work againat uniformity. Everyone knows when Dominion and provincial
holidays occur, but no one knows in advance
when a municipality may declare a civic

holiday. And think what effect the uncertainty

would have on business men who have bills
of exchange falling due throughout the
country. One man might hold a number of
bills which are ahl payable on thc samne date,
but at different places. In some towns hie
would get his money, while in others there
might be a civic holiday aud hie would have
to wait until the next banking dey.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If it was civic
holiday in Toronto on thc 2nd of August, a
bill falling due there on that date would not
he colleetable until bbc 3rd. If Winnipeg's
civic holiday occurred on bhc 8th, payments
due on that day would have to he postponed
until thc 9th. So in the sense that this Bill
recognizes as a legal holiday thc day whiolh
is declared by any municipaliby as civie holiday, it tends to uniformiby.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, it does
in that sense. I think we can sec what
complications may arise if we consider a
hypotihetical case. Suppose a man takes a
three-month bll which will become due at
bhc city of Stratford on bbc 3rd of August.
Knowing that bbe payer is a responsible party,
he acts on the assumption that bbc bill will be
paid on the 3rd and arranges to meet an
obligation on that day. But in bbc meantime
bbc city of Straftord declares bbc 3rd of Augusb
to, be civic holiday. and consequently bbe bill
does not become payable until the 4th. The
holder of bbc note had no way of knowing
that in advance, and hie finds himself in a
tight corner. That is an illustration of bhc
kind of thing that would be likely to occur
in numerous instances all over bbc Dominion.
If civic holiday were fixed by Parliament for
bbc same date throughout Canada, no difficulty would arise, but there are thousands of
municipalities and every onc of them may
choose any date it prefers for bbc holiday. If
this provision were passed business men would
not ho, able to bell whether their bills fell
due on bhc specified due date or the day
afberwards, or even two days afterwards should
a Sunday intervene.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read bbc second time.

Provided that no provision of this Act shall

MAY 9,1934
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHBEN: I do not
either.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is not in the
Bill.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There bas
been some error in the printing. The copy
that I bave is the Bill "as passed by the
flouse of Commons, 4th May, 1934," and it
contains no sucb phrase as my honourable
friend bas read. There is na reference to

$1,000,000 at all.

What is tbe
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
number of the Bill?
No. 55.
Rigbit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Wbile we are waiting for the original Bill,
we mighit discuss tbe inclusion of a provision
for paying out rnoney in a Bill whose purpose ies to save rnoney by means of salary
deductions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There surely is
a reason, but I bave not been able ta discaver it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I sbould
presume that the reasan was this: deductions
have already been rnade in accordance witb
the legislation previously passed, and under
this Bill the recipients of salaries of less tban
one tbousand dollars are ta bave those deductions refunded. That must be the reason.
But why $1,000,000 sbould be needed passes
my comprebension.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let me give a
ooncrete illustration of wbat I think it means.
The stenographic staff of the Senate are
paid a daily rate of $5, less ten per cent, or
flfty cents. They are now getting $4.50 a
day. Unless their rernuneration reaches $1,000
a year it will become necessary later ta
reimburse thern at the rate of flfty cents a
day. It will depend on the length of the
session whetber the reimibursernent will apply
ta the wbole period or only part of it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: My honourable friend is quite right.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It was ta
meet such a situation, I think, that tbe
change was made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Sa ýthere would
be provisional deductions which would have
ta be reirnbursed at the end of the year?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, that is
right. Some deduetions have been made
already, and, as the honaurable senatar says,
some will continue ta be made, and it rnay
be that only at a later tirne, perbaps at the
end of the year, can it be ascertained what
they should be.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The end of the
fiscal year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I find that
the bonourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was right, and that my Bill was wrong.
The words "one million dollars" are in the
original Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: The stenographers
are ernployed -only for the session. Why
should tbey corne into this $1,000 class at all?
Hon. Mr. MURDOÇCK: Because they have
to eat and sleep 365 days in the year.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: We do not pay
them ta sleep.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It all depends
on the lengtb of the session.

adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. McRae:
That this House is of the opinion that
Canada should withdraw frorn membership in
the League of Nations, and that no further
mnoney should be voted ta the League.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable members,
I do not know whether I should proceed witb
this debate this afternoon. I arn in the
hands of the right honourable leader of the
House.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
we going to adjourn?

To what time are

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is my
intention to move that when the House
adjourns it stand adjourned until Friday at
3 o'clock; and on Friday to move that we
adjourn until Tuesday at 8 o'clock. The
meeting on Friday is rendered advisable from
our own standpoint, I think, in order that we
may meet the necessities of the case in relation to 'the Thousand Islands Bridge Bill.
Had it not been for that Bill we should
have been quite within our rights in adjourning longer; but I do not think we should
allow any enterprise of such magnitude and
importance to be delayed. Therefore I am
going to ask that when the House adjourns
to-day it stand adjourned until Friday. I
am sorry that this is necessary, because I
said to more than one honourable memberparticularly to the honourable gentleman
from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth)-that the House would adjourn until
Tuesday, and on this understanding they
have geone home. This is just one of those
vicissitudes that cannot be avoided. There
is no reason, however, why the honourable
gentleman should not proceed with his
address.

Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it the intenthe Government to bring down the
Governor to give the Royal Assent

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is the
intention not to delay any measure unnecessarily. I cannot give any definite answer
as to when the Royal Assent will be asked
for. All I can say is that we shall endeavour
not te delay this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is there any likelihood of the Deputy Governor coming here
to sanction it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
other bills as well.

There are

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: If it is the desire
of honourable members that I should move
the adjournment of the debate until Wednesday, I shall do so; otherwise I shal. proceed now.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Go ahead.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I beg of the House
to bear with me for but a few moments. I
intend to make my remarks this afternoon
in French, and shall be as brief as possible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

(Translation): It is perhaps apropos that a
French voice be heard in the course of this
discussion on international problems and activities at Geneva-not only because the rights of
the French language must be upheld in this
Chamber, but also and especially because this
vehicle of expression and communication par
excellence, among diplomatic circles, must
everywhere preserve the prestige and place of
honour which international usage and traddition have established.
So as on the one hand net to weary the
majority of my audience, and on the other
hand to avoid repeating what has already
been stated on this very important question
dealing with the maintenance or abolition of
the League of Nations, I shall endeavour to
be as brief as possible. Moreover, I have
no other authority to take part in this debate
than that which is conferred upon me by a
close observation of world events during the
last fifteen years, and also-must I say?-by
the ties of discreet but deep sympathy which
unite those whose sons tragically disappeared
in the great upheaval of 1914-1918 and those
who may be likewise called upon te give
their own flesh and blood to the hecatomb
of to-morrow.
I was quite impressed while listening to all
the speeches which enlivened this debate,
particularly those of my hon. leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand)-the foremost Canadian authority
in the international field-and of my hon.
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). I
agree with the eloquent remarks and strong
plea made by the latter in faveur of the
poor and humble people; I refuse, however,
to endorse his direct and vehement attack
against the mover of the resolution under consideration by this Chamber. I am not willing
to admit that the intentions of my hon. friend
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae) were
not sincere. I really think that his purpose in
precipitating this debate was to bring out
the facts and secure an expression of opinion
which would guide publie opinion as much as
possible, rather than deliberately to induce
the Canadian people to repudiate by the voice
of their Parliament their sacred obligations
and refuse in cold blood their official and
loyal co-operation in the great work of peace
promoted and partly accomplished by the
League of Nations. In this respect he has
won a splendid success, for the statements
made and views expressed in the course of
this important debate will be of great interest
to those who, at present, are studying the
great problem of the survival of nations.
The object of the discussion seems te bear
on the real nature of the responsibilities

MAY 9, 1934
which Canada assumed in ratifying for lier
own part the famous Article 10 of the Pact;
on our precise obligations in case of an
attack by one nation, member of the League
of Nations, on another, and the extent, to
which we must co-operate in a military way
-the economic sanctions flot liaving been
sufflcient-with those who will be called upon
to carry out the decree of the Council of the
League of Nations.
Although the explanations given by my
lion. friend from de Lorimier (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) only partly satisfy me, I arn
frankly of opinion, witb many others, that
the probability of our partîcipating in an
armed conflict under the 2egis of the League
of Nations are so remote that it should not
deter us from reposing our trust in the
generous and well intentioned men who
periodically meet at Geneva to maintain in
our perpetually unsettled world a degree of
peace which, relatively, lias been very satisfactory hitherto.
Many -other reasons bave also been invoked in favour of our withdrawal from the
League of Nations.

I shaîl mention but one

-the most important, to, my mind, because
it is the most Iikely to strike the popular
imagination, especially in these days of distress, almost nation-wide; it is the considerable annual expenditure which we have to,
make in order to have the privilege, honour
and riglit of being a member of the League
of Nations. I do not think that any one
could reply with more effeet and convincing
eloquence to this «objection than did the
hon. senator for Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) when he stated:
In conclusion xnay I say that I neyer for
one moment thouglit that this Sexiste, composed
as it is of distinguished and capable citizens,
would say to the people of Canada, "'We are
willing to continue a tax of $1.25 per capita
for the maintenance of national defence, but
we deeline to permit the per capita expenditure
of three cents, the value of a mere postage
stamp, as Oanada's contribution to upholding
the bannera of peace and to co-operating with
the Britishi Empire and other nations so that
in some conclusive way war may be made for
ever impossible.
In spite of this, it is clear that an honest
and serious endeavour, directed toward a
greater economy, would be most welcome
to the Canadian people, and one of the
means to succeed on this ground is to further
assert, as a nation, our faitli ini the League
of Nations, and draw more and more sympatliy around it-thus contributing towards
increasing the number of its members and,
indirectly. reducing the expenditure of its
adherents.

367

I regret, with many others, the abstention
of the United States. It is, intleed, very unfortunate that a nation of such importance
-for reasons, if flot of petty selfishness, at
least of ultra-nationalism and party politics
-bas flot thought proper to accept generously
and nobly the part which a great President
had intended for lier.
May I, here, express the hope that soon
Washington wilI realize the disgraceful,
humiliating and unfortunate position ini whîch
it finds itself to-day through its narrow
policy *of conceited isolation.
My hon. friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) made, in the course of bis remarks,
another statement whicli caught my ear and
filled my soul with sadness. H1e stated that if
tbe League of Nations had existed when the
Canadian-American international frontier lines
were drawn, certain eastern sections of the
United States would perhaps to-day be in
Canadian territory.
He might have made the same comment
as regards what is commonly known as the
Alaska Panhandie, for, perhaps, in the latter
case the authorized voice of our venerable
colleague from York North (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) would have awakened a more
favourable response in Geneva than it did
in London. May I further discreetly add, without going back to the deluge, that had the
League of Nations existed it might also have
prevented that tragic event, that stain on the
glorious British blazon which can hardly ever
be erased, known in history as "ile grand
dérangement"ý-in ýother words, the deportation of -the Acadians (1775) ; and, incidentally,
Longfellow's most sympathetic heroine would
not have been born, and United States
literature would bave been deprived of one
of its most beautiful masterpieces.
A French economist whom I intend to quote
at greater length in a few moments, even
writes that if, in July, 1914, there had existed'
that "central exeliange" and "that green
carpet with seats scattered around it"ý-that
is the picturesque and significant name lie
gives to the League of Nations--it is believable that the great catastrophe would have
been avoided.
My hon. friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) suggests at the close of bis remarks,
substituting some other means for the work
of the League of Nations so -as to eliminate
the possibility of armed conflicts between nations. His statement is as f ollows:
After fifteen years of futile effort for international peace there remains but one way to
obtain the abolishment of war. The road ia
open, clear and certain, and tests the sincerity

368

SENATE

of the nations that say they want world peace.
I refer to the total discontinuance by all
nations of the manufacture and sale of arma-

points where there might be a chance of
putting in a telling blow, resulting in a
contraction of program" and also a corresponding decrease in the strictly necessary
expenditures.
One of the important parts played by the
League of Nations is constantly to establish
between nations a rational equilibrium between the abuse of extreme nationalism and
the monopolizing effect of ill advised internationalism.
With that end in view, it must not aspire
to a status and authority overruling the state,
but rather be satisfied with being "a plain
centre of international intercourse."
The League of Nations has, therefore, a
very intricate and difficult part to play: the
part of arbitrator and mediator, and-one
must keep this consideration in mind before
passing any opinion on it-it is nevertheless the most gigantic human effort ever
attempted towards the establishment of universal peace, so far as that is possible here
on earth. Each nation has its own notions,
usages and customs, its language and its own
characteristics, and each has a natural right
to keep intact and distinct all that constitutes its ancestral heritage; but if the flags
of the various nations on earth have colours
which symbolize their particular character
and their own patriotic ideals, people must
remember that blood bas not two colours
and that to bu happy they must live on
terms of universal brotherhood. It is the
great lesson which, for the last fifteen years,
has been taught through the existence and
work of the League of Nations. Far from
being ineffective, it has proved useful both
in the abstract and in the sphere of concrete
facts; and before endeavouring to paralyse
its efforts and destroy it, something better
should bu found to replace it. I am not
aware that the establishment of any superior
institution bas yet been proposed.
International conferences, special alliances, trade
treaties and independent conventions were
resorted to, but always without definite and
permanent success. I therefore state, and this
is my last word, that if the League of Nations
did not exist, we should have to establish one.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien, the debate
was adjourned.

meuts and munitions of war. Such a policy
fully enforced would end war at no distant
date.
I willingly endorse, without restriction, such
a policy. But, I ask my hon. friend, how
shall we succeed in putting it into practice
without the existence of an international
agency whence will come the order, and who
will provide uniformity of action? Such an
agency exists already, and is precisely known
as the League of Nations. Why then destroy
an institution to substitute a similar one and
thus lose the fruit of all that has been
accomplished hitherto?
I do not wish to enumerate again all the
services rendered by the League of Nations.
This has already been splendidly done, and
more thoroughly than I could do it. Let me
simply state that the greatest merit of the
League of Nations-especially in these times,
when one is too easily led, in certain circles,
to urge one's right by brutal force-resides in
the protection afforded to minorities, and
particularly through the mediation of the
Permanent Court of International Justice.
In fact, the League of Nations is, to my
mind, a necessary international tribunal, or
forum, and it is unloyal and unfair to
iudge it without taking into consideration
the extenuating circumstances, namely the
obstacles which this institution had to surmount from the very outset and which it
bas still to contend with in spreading over
the world its appeasing and pacifying influence.
I now wish to quote an interesting author
to whom I alluded a moment ago, Mr.
Gonzague de Reynold, who bas written a
splendid essay on the need of unity and
organization of the League of Nations. He
writes as follows:
One must admit that the League of Nations
is imlucky. It endeavours to carry out internationalism at a time when nationalisms are
desperate, multiply and take shape. It advocates the freedom of trade, the lowering of
tariff barriers at a time when all countries
are raising their tariff and' carry on exaggerated protection. It convenes, at Geneva, the
Disarmament Conference, at a moment when
the Japanese start war against the Chinese.
These checks, successive defeats could not do
otherwise than ,strike a telling blow at the

MAY 9, 1934
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honoureble
senators, I beg ta move that this order be
discharged and placed on the Order Paper for
two weeks from to-day. On this motion I
hope the Chair will allow debate, as the
honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) wisbes to, say something on the
measure. Ho may flot be in his seat when
it is again dealt with.
While an my feet I may say that the
Western Provinces objected ta the measure.
In deference ta their objections those who
had asked for the Bill witbdreiv their request.
Since thon others have requested its enaotment in a modifiod f orm. The modified
formn is being submitted to the Western
Provinces. Their replies will flot reech us
for about two we-eks. Hence the motion I
have just made.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, I tbank the right bonourable leader of
the House for according me an oppartunity
ta make a few brief observations. These
inay flot ho germane ta the Bill, but neyertheless I deem it an opportune time ta
present tbem.
It must be within the knowledge of bionourable memibers and others that a very
considerable volume of spirituous lîquor is
smuggled into Canada. This is particularly
true witb respect ta the Maritime Provinces
and Que'bec. The ilicit traffic bas also increa-sed in Ontario and the Western Provinces,
for reasons which I shaîl give in a moment.
It is obviaus that smuggled and illicitly
manufactured liquor pays no duty, and consequently there is a serious loss of revenue
ta the Government.
But much more serious is the demoralization of the people. When a particular Iaw
is broken, respect for alilIaws is weakened.
This is undoubtedly so witb regard ta aur
youtb. They know very well what is going
on, and there is samething ýabout smuggling
that appeals ta their spirit of adventure.
They are aware that the majority of Canadians do not condemn boatlegging and
smuggling. These young men long for the
day wben tbey will be able ta engage in
the traffic and swagger araund perhaps with
a revolver in their pockets, and, by defying
the authorities, gain a certain measure of
natoriety.
I understand that et anc of the recent
conferences ini Ottawa the provincial premiers
discussed the question with the Prime Minister and members of bis Government. It
was suggested that the only way ta stop the
traffic was ta make a drastic reduction in the
customns and excise duties. This would ta

some extent reduce the revenue, particularly
in Ontario and perhaps also in the Western
Provinces; but it is passible that lower prices
would discourage boatlegging and smuggling,
and ta that extent, a very mucb lesser volume
of contraband liquor would be consumed.
That smuggling flourishes along the border
between Canada and the United States is
evident from a paragraph that appeared in
the Montreal Daily Star of April 24. It is
quoted from the Memphis Commercial
Appeal and is beaded, "Bootleg Tide
Reversed."
Ontario police officiais report that rum
rulning fromn the United States inta Canada
is going ahead an a big scale, and that the
liquar smuggling mechinery lias gone into
reverse with great ease and efficiency. Large
quantities of United States made liquor have
been seized in border towns and even as far
away as London. . . . Canada bas the liraditional Britishi respect for law and arder in
great measure, but unduly high liquor prices
and too rigid restrictions allow bootleggers ta
flourish there. The incident bas a salutary
lesson for wets and drys alike, as they Bearch
for the moet setisfactery solution of the liquar
puzzle.
It is apparent that conditions are just as
bad in the United States. In its editorial
column of May 7 tbe O'ttawa Citizen quotes
Mr. Joseph H. Choate, Director of the
Federal Alcohal Control Administration, tbat
"there is mare bootleg liquor being made and
sold in tbe United States to-day than ever
in the palmiest days of prohibition." In bis
opinion the only remedy is ta reduce the
excise duty so that bootlegging and swuggling
would na longer ho profitable. I aLm told,
and I believe it ta be witbin reason, that if
tbe smnugglers get one car of liquor out of
four landed they make a lot ai money. Tbey
cen afford te, lose three cargoes te get in one.
The customs duty is, I think, $10 per proaf
gallon, and the strength uf the liquor brought
in is generally 40 over-proof. Sa every gallon
of over-proof would be, by moasure, almost
anc and a haîf gallons proof. Tbis wauld
mean, if my calculation is correct, that there
is a duty of about $14 a gallon on an article
that costs from 50 te 80 cents ta manufacture. You cen see, theref are, the tremendaus
inducement tbat is beld out ta mon te, make
a business of breakîng the law, and -the
consequent demoralizing effect upon the
people. I do not think I need say mare.
If there is any way ta prevent this business,
wbich is certainly a very injuriaus one from
every point of view, it sbould be considered.
There is a small army of mon in the Maritime Provinces, on land and sea, wbo are
trying ta prevent this business. But it is
practically impossible ta do so hocause of the
tremendaus coastline of the Maritime Prov-

inces, with all its indentations, and harbours
and rivers, and the close proximity of the
islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, where
there is, I think I might say, an unlimited
supply of spirituous liquors to be obtained
from vessels lying outside the three-mile limit.
Those vessels are met by fishermen, and by
smugglers in very fast boats, and the liquor
is landed in all kinds of places with the cooperation of the people. The traffic cannot
be stopped by the police. It is said that even
the officials who are commissioned to stop
the traffic may be approached, because there
is so much money in it. That is most demoralizing to the authorities.
As I see it, the only way to prevent this
business is to make the duty so low that
the traffic would not be profitable to the
smugglers. We had practically none of this
trouble in the Maritimes and eastern Quebec
before the duties were increased during the
War. I voted for the increase at that time
because I thought it proper and necessary as
a war measure. But the duty remains at the
same high level, and I would vote against
it now, for the reasons I have mentioned.
I understand that the conference of provincial premiers that met with the Government here last winter is to re-convene after
prorogation, and that this subject will come
before it to be considered. I would suggest,
therefore, that this House appoint a committee of reasonable size to secure from preventive officers in or near Ottawa information
in regard to this business and the efforts that
are being made to prevent it. We should
find out what these efforts are costing, and
whether, in the opinion of the witnesses, the
prevention or a curtailment of the smuggling
is possible. This information could be secured
at very small cost, and when the provincial
premiers and the federal authorities meet it
would be useful to them in reaching a decision
as to what is best to do in regard to the
traffic.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Unfortunately, the
right honourable the leader of the House was
called away to a very important interview.
I know that he will regret not having heard
the honourable gentleman's remarks.
No doubt my honourable friend's suggestion
has much merit, if it is practicable. On the
other hand, taxes are not imposed merely for
the pleasure of imposing them; and usually
they are imposed where they can best be
borne. Liquor is a luxury. If it were not,
it would never be subject to such a heavy
tax. Tobacco, being a luxury, also bears a
heavy tax; in fact, the price of cigarettes is
made up mainly of the tax.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: My argument is that
we are losing revenue by reason of this
smuggling.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It may be that the
Government, because it needs revenue, will
find it utterly impossible to consider the
suggestion which bas been made. I would ask
my honourable friend how he ties up his
suggestion with the Bill that is now before
the House.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In my opening remarks I stated that what I was about to say
was not particularly germane to this Bill.
I mentioned to the right honourable leader of
the House the subject that I intended to
bring up, and he told me that in his opinion
it would be quite in order for me to do so.
The Order stands.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting was resumed.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. C. E. TANNER presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill 27, an Act to incorporate
Thousand Islands Bridge Company, and moved
concurrence therein.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill 27 was
on Wednesday referred back to the Standing
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills,

MAY 11, 1934
and the Cormmittee now retommends that the
following 'he added te the Bill as subelause 2
of clause 17:
The company shall fot commence its operations or incur any liability before a sum of at
least fifty thousand dollars ha@ been paid into
the treasury of the Dominion of Canada, whieh
sum shall net be withdrawn until the proposed
bridges, together with their approaehee, buildings and ail other assets used in connection
therewith are constructed, and sueh sum shail
be forfeited to, Hia Majesty if sucli project is
flot completedl.
The Committee f ound a precedent for that
provision in a similar bill whkdh wa-s passed by
Parliament last year and was quife satisfactory
to the premoters. That is the only amendment the Committee is recommending with
respect to the financial features of the measure.
The Committee thinks that the deposif of
$50,000 will be a substantial proof of good
faith on the part of the company, and that
this additional requirement will make fthe
measure satisfactory. It shouid be not-ed that
by section il the company is required to cernply with the Security Fraud Prevention Act
of Ontario, under which the issue of securities
would be thoroughly analysed, and that the
company must satisfy the Governor in Council of this complian-ce. The Commiftee would
like to have the proposed amenchnent considered this afternoon, if that is agreeaible to
the House.

Hon. Mr. MacARTRUR:
Henourable
senators, my honourable friend from Queen's
(Hon. Mr. Sinclair) bas written te request that
consideratien of this matter lie deferred.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I did not

the Departmenf of Agriculture considers it
important thaf the Bill bie enacted witheut
delay. I feel sure that if the honourable
senaf or knew the facts he weuld net ask that
consideration lie deferred until next, week.
The Commons lias r-oneiirred in aIl our
amendments except three. The fhree ainendments are really one and the same. for in the
thre.e sections wbilcl provide that tlhe Minister
may make regulations this House inserted the
conditien, "with the appreval of the Governor
in Council."
It will be recalled that the honeurable mnember from Queen's feit that, as very sweeping
powers were being given te flie Minister, it
would lie advisable fliat any sucli regulations
lie migbt make should be approved by the
Governor in Council. I pointed eut at the time
fliat flua appreval would probably involve
delay, which miglit be very serious in relation
te fruit, because of its perishability; but during
the discussion I becamne persuaded that prebably it would lie better te accept fhe honourable gentleman's suggestion.
The message from thie Commens states that

Honey.

372

SENATE

One of the primary reasons for complete
revision of the Fruit Act at this time was the
expressed desire by producers, package manufacturers and the trade, after thirty-three years'
experience, for legislation of a more flexible
character.
Because of the perishable nature of the
products concerned, the uncontrollable conditions of production, changes in marketing
methods, the effect of truck distribution and
other factors, they especiaHy urged that the
Minister be given power to prescribe the regulations and thereby avoid even such delay as
might be necessary if made subject to the
approval of the Governor in Council.
In this connection I quote the following letter
addressed to me on April 26, 1934, by Mr. L. F.
Burrows, Secretary-Treasurer of the Canadian
Horticultural Council, and also letter of September 19, 1933, from Mr. E. J. Ohambers,
Chairman of the Grades Committee of the
British Columbia Fruit Growers' Association
and President and General Manager of the
Associated Growers of British Columbia,
Limited.
This is the letter from Mr. Burrows:
Re Fruit and Honey Act
I have just learned that the Senate yesterday
in dealing with the above Act made certain
amendments, the principal one of which is that
the word "Minister" as it occurs in the first line
of section 3, and subsequent like paragraphs, is
stru.ek out and the words "Governor in Council"
inserted.
He is wrong as to the amendment and its
relative importance, but that does not matter.
As you are undoubtedly aware, the effect of
this amendment will be to seriously delay action
being taken as promptly as is essential in dealing with so highly perishable a commodity as
fruit. The provision to have the Minister make
regulations has been requested by the industry
from one ,part of Canada to the other during
the past number of years, and its significance
and effect is thoroughly underistood and desired
by them. Since the Bill received third reading
in the House of Commons copies have again
been widely distributed and as widely approved
by the entire industry, and the amendment now
proposed by the Senate will be most disappointing.
On behalf of this Couneil, representing the
entire fruit industry of the Dominion, I shall
very sincerely appreciate euch action as may,
even at this time, be possible to secure the
reconsideration by the Senate in this matter.
This is the letter from Mr. Chambers:
Further te question of power being given
your Department for the establishing of fruit
grades instead of this having to be done by
legislation.
There have been so many instances during
the past number of years when conditions could
have been dealt with much more effectively if
your Department had this responsibility tha,t
every effort should be made at the coming session to bring this about. The situation would
have been even more difficult if it had not been
for the splendid co-operation that bas been extended both by your executive officials and your
district supervisors.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Marketing, climatic and other conditions very
often necessitate changes being made to cope
with the situation and it would be almost impossible to have these contingencies covered by
legislation and some more practical means of
dealing with them should be devised.
We sincerely trust that every effort will be
made to have this change brought about this
coming session.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, in order to expedite the matter, I will
take the responsibility of withdrawing my
objection on behalf of my honourable friend
from Queen's.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thank the
honourable senator. I had better read the
concluding portion of 'Mr. McIntosh's letter:
As an illustration of conditions that arise, it
is noted that in the southern part of the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia last September,
in the Pentieton area, approximately 175,000
boxes of apples were put out of the grades
within twenty minutes because of injury by bail.
Legally there was no way in which this fruit
could be offered for household use, although
for immediate consumption the apples were of
good quality. The situation had to be met and
in reality arrangements made contrary to the
Act in order to permit of the growere marketing these apples.
In Nova Scotia two years ago a similar situation resulted from a wind storm, creating an
emergency condition.
Matters of more minor character relating to
marking of packages, standardization of packages, inspection and certification, packing and
transportation arise on many occasions throughout the crop season.
In the Root Vegetables Act, Maple Sugar Industry Act, Seed Act, Feeding Stuffs Act, Fertilizer Act and Agricultural Peet Control Act
the Minister is given power to prescribe regulations. This bas proved so satisfactory to all
concerned in the production and marketing of
these commodities that the fruit interests have
for some time been endeavouring to have the
same provision made in the Fruit Act.
Over six thousand copies of the Act were
distributed among those interested in the
different Parts, and received almost unanimous
endorsation of provincial and Dominion-organizations.
I must say that the reasons seem to me
I therefore move that the
unanswerable.
Senate do not insist on its first, second and
fifth amendments.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In my ignorance I
do not see much difference between an Order
in Council and the Minister. The Minister
could very well write an Order in Council, or
tell his secretary to do so, and bring it down.
Of course, under that procedure there would
be some delay and in the meantime the fruit
might go bad.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is it.
There is a lot of delay.

MAY 11, 1934
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I trust that wben
the bonourable senator frorn Queen's (Bon.
Mr. Sinclair) returns the right honourable
leader will make a thorough explanation.
Right Hon. ýMr. 'MEIGHEN: I arn sure the
honourable senator frorn Queen's will agree
that what we are doing had to be done.
Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, there may be a reason, as the right
honourable leader says, for giving full authority to the Minister. As explained on a former
occasion by the honourable senator frorn
Queen's (Hon. MT. Sinclair), it is the Minister
who makes the regulations, which really becorne the law. I think rny honourable friend
frorn -De Lanaudière ('Hon. Mr. Ca-grain) is a
littIe in error in irnplying that a Minister's
recommendation is always adopted by Council. If he had been a Mînister he would have
known that sornetimes the sponsoring of a
recommendation is a wearisome experience.
It is a common thing for a departruent to
focus its attention on one objective, and the
Minister usually takes the advice of his departmental experts. But when he brings his
recommendation to Council, other Ministers
rnay have entirely different ideas and the
recommendation may be seriously arnended
before it is adopted.

According to my information, the measure

amount in respect of the other House, but
that there is no provision in relation to the

Do I need ta say anything more? Is there
any ground for the statement that the delegations from Canada were composed of pacifists?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, I did not say
that.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I dislike to contradiet my honourable friend, but I think I am
stating correctly the impression that I
gathered. At page 329 of Hansard the honourable gentleman is quoted as saying:.
The Canadian end of the League of Nations
has fallen largely into the hands of pacifists
or people pacifistically inclined. Here was a
proposal ta maintain peace by force. Support
for the organization was supposed ta come from
people willing ta fight for peace. With the
repudiation of article 10 the League could
no longer rely on force ta execute its judgments; it had ta rely on public opinion. I
submit that a study of human nature and of
history can lea-d to but one conclusion: that a
League of Nations supported by pacifists is
from its very inception wholly ineffective.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I was referring
there to the organization that supports the
League in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In another passage
my honourable friend stated that delegations
to the League from nations throughout the
world were composed of second-rate statesmen.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. Again I correct my honourable friend. I said:
After al-, those who control the affairs of
the League are more or less second-rate men
of the member-nations which they represent.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Well; I am willing
to leave it to the House whether my interpretation is sound. If the League is composed of
delegations which are made up of second-rate
statesmenHon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Again I must correct my honourable friend. I said "oontrolled," not "composed."
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The League can be
controlled only by delegations, and if the delegations are composed of second-rate statesmen, I think I have interpreted fairly what my
honourable friend said.

375

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. The League
is controlled by a group of member states in
Europe, as everyone knows. The delegations
that we send consist of very eminent Canadians, but they have very little influence in
the control of the League, so far as policy
is concerned.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will leave that
question ta the judgment of this House. I
thought we were entitled to hold a much
better opinion of the work done by our delegates. I intend to refer to this matter a
little later, but in the meantime may I say
that virtually all the European delegations
have been headed by the most outstanding
statesmen of the different countries. I will
give a few of the names that come to my
mind at this moment. From France: Clémenceau, Briand, Herriot, Barthou, Boncour, Tardieu and Painlev6. I do not know of any
more prominent men in France than those.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
isters.

Ex-Prime Min-

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes. From Italy:
Schialoya and Grandi. From other countries:
Benès Politis, de Madariaga, Apponyi and
Huymans. From Germany: Stresemann and
Curtius. From Great Britain: Lloyd George,
Balfour, Cecil, Austen -Chamberlain, Ramsay
MacDonald, Sir John Simon and Arthur
Henderson. It would be difficult to choose
an equal number of British statesmen of
higher eminence and greater ability.
Now may I address myself to the SinoJapanese conflict? I will do so by putting ta
the House this question: Could it be reasonably expected that this matter, which has
created throughout the world a very profound impression against the League, could
be settled by the League? In this connection
may I give the House a brief excerpt from
the Lytton report of 'the conditions which
existed in Manchuria at the time:
During the preceding quarter of a century
the ties which bounid Manchuria ta the rest
of China were growing stronger, and at the
same time the intereste of Japan iin Manchuria
were increasing. Manchuria was admittedly a
part of China, but it was a part in which
Japan had acquired sueh exceptional rights, sa
restricting the exercise of China's sovereign
rights, .that a conflict between the two countries was a natural result. These exceptional
rights are chiefly based on the Treaty of Peking
of 1905, following the Treaty of Portsmouth,
and on the Treaty of 1915, known as the
"Twenty-one Demande," as well as on various
railway contracte. The list of these rights
shows the exceptional character of the political,
economie, and legal relations created between
Japan and China in Manchuria. There is probably nowhere in the world an exact parallel to
this situation; no example of a country enjoy.

376

SENATE

ing in the territory of a neighbouring State
such extensive economic and administrative
privileges.
Honourable gentlemen, let us go back a
few years to the time preceding this incident
and see how Japan, after acquiring Manchuria
in 1905, was forced by all the Great Powers
of Europe to abandon her conquest; how,
immediately after she had withdrawn her
armies from Manchuria, Russia annexed the
country and treated it as a Russian province;
and how she declined to recognize the validity of rights thus acquired unless Russia

recognized her occupation of Korea. The
Russo-Japanese war followed, and to the
surprise of the world Japan gained a decisive
victory.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It was no surprise
to the world.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: By the Treaty of
Portsmouth Ruesia ceded to Japan all ber
railway and mineral concessione in Manchuria, with the right to continue the military
occupation of the railway zone.

Then came the Treaty of 1915, which Japan
forced China to enter into under threat of
war.
By the Nine-Power Treaty the Great
Powers agreed to respect 'China's sovereignty.
Let us not forget that from the moment
Japan assumed control of Manchuria the
Chinese began to migrate to that province,
leaving their own flag and fleeing from
anarchy to the stable government of Japan.
They settled there so rapidly that they soon
numbered 30,000,000. They preferred to live
under Japanese rule rather than under Chinese
anarchy. It must be admitted that Manchuria
was Chinese territory, and that if China preferred to allow the province to rpt in anarchy,
it was her business. True, but it was very
annoying for Japan, with two billion yen invested in Manchuria, and absolutely depending on the country for her raw materials and
food supply.
Honourable members will see how intermingled were the interests of the two nations. How was it possible for the League to
render justice to both?
Now I call the attention of the House to
the solution suggested by the Lytton Commission. I trust honourable members will
share my opinion that by the League of Nations, as by every other agency in this world,
there are certain things that cannot be accomplished. Every day we have recourse to
physicians, and in many cases we find them
incapable of effecting a cure. Why, then,
Hlon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

should the League of Nations be condemned
because it was confronted with a state of
things which could not be remedied? Allow
me to read this passage from the report:
A mere restoration of the status quo ante
would be no solution. Since the present confliet
arose out of the conditions prevailing before
last September, to restore those conditions
would merely be to invite a repetition of the
trouble. It would be to treat the whole question theoretically, and to leave out of account
the realities of the situation.
It is not therefore a question of rendering
unto Caesar what is Caesar's. It is a question
of finding a modus vivendi under which these
conflicting interests existing to such an acute
degree in Manchuria could be harmonized
and arranged so that there might be no repetition of the irruption of 1931.
What is the conclusion reached by the
Lytton Commission? That the interests of
three nations must be harmonized: Russia's
interest in respect to her railway; Japan's
interest , in respect to the treaties I have
cited; and the interest of China as being the
sovereign nation. To this end the Commission recommends the ratification of treaties
already concluded; then a treaty of commerce,
a treaty of non-aggression, the creation of a
semi-independent
State-which
practically
exists to-day-but under the sovereignty of
China, and the withdrawal of the Japanese
troops.
The report was ratified by the Council of
the League, then by the Committee of Nineteen, and, lastly, by the Assembly.
So far no possible reproach can be levelled
at the League. Its opponents say: "The
League fell down. It did not have the courage
to put into effect the recommendations of
the Lytton Commission." But everyone knows
that if the Great Powers had attempted to
force Japan to withdraw ber troops from
Manchuria there would have been war. Do
honourable members believe that it would
have been wise for the League to incur this
dreadful responsibility? Happily the war was
then confined to the Far East, where there
was little inflammable and explosive material.
Would it have been wise to run the risk of
involving Europe in war?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I remind my
honourable friend that article 10 provides
for an economie embargo before resort to war.
Why did the League not put that article into
effect?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If my honourable
friend will be patient, I shall attempt in the
course of my argument to give the answer

377

MAY 15, 1934
to bis question. I arn coming to the econornic
sanctions.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I arn sorry to have
interrupted the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIIEN: Everyone is agreed
that if the major nations, members of the
League, had resorted to force, the results
throughout the world might have been
appalhing.
I corne now to the economic sanctions.
My honourable friend rejoioes in b.aving been
a consistent opponent of the League, taking
whenever occasion arose an extraordinary and
incomprehiensible pleasure in deriding the
League. To hirn it is a great satisfaction
to find that statesmen thToughout the world
have failed to do away with the greatest curse
of mankind. And perhaps in this case too
hie may have some reason to rejoice, but I
doubt it.
Tbe economic sanctions could only be
applied if ail the great nations subscribed to
thern. If the League, or its member nations,
had invoked these sanctions against Japan,
wbat would bave happenied should the
United States once again disappoint Europe?
What would bave happened then to the
commerce of Great Britain? What would
have been the resuit to the commerce of
France and of ail the other great powers of
Europe? Japan would have turned to the
United States. Would that have been a desirable thing for the European powers? And
if the United States bad joined the member
nations of the League in enforcing the
econornic sanctions, to wbat extent could
Japan bave secured essentiai supplies frorn
Russia?
But there is something more to be taken
into consideration. Pbilip Noel Baker, of
Yale University, in a recent address stated
that if Engiand bad taken the lead, perhaps
the United States would have foliowed. The
answer to bis statement came very swiftiy:
If econornie sanctions had then been invoked
against Japan, she would have resorted to
war. Wbat wouid have been tbe result?
Honourabie mernbers, it is easy to deal with
these great questions when you have no responsibility; but wben you are responsibie it
is appallingly difficuit to reach a conclusion.
When tbe nations had to decide whether or
nlot tbey would apply tbe economic sanctions,
tbey bad no assurance that the United States
wouid co-operate; and without such co-operation notbing effective couid have been
accompiished. And it would bave been disastrous if the United States had j oined the

member nations of the League, for it is
virtually certain that Japan would have resorted to war. Rather than take this grave
risk, was it nlot better for the League to pause
and determine not to seek success at such a
frightful coat?
Another sin of omission chs.rged against
the League of Nations is its failure to bring
about disarmament. For the last six or seven
years negotiations have been in progress to

Hon. Mr. CASGRA-N: Ten years.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEiN: Three modes of disarmament have been suggested: the horizontal, the quantitative, and tbe qualitative.
Finaily, a year ago, Great Britain suggested
a period of probation, foliowed by disarmarnent. But unfortunately Gerrnany then
gave notice of withdrawal from the League.
But, honourable meinbers, is it not true
that there is no probiem of disarmarnent?
The oniy problem is one of security. No
nation wants to carry the crushing load of
armarnents. I well rernember when in 1931
Mr. Briand made his last great speech before
the League. Re was a very sick man at the
tirne.

Tbe question of disarmament bad been

urged by Lord Robert Cecil with ail the
force and energy at bis command wben defending the policy of the League of Nations.
Mr. Briand rnounted the rostrurn and in effect
said:

appalliug metbods and instruments of destruction, presently unknowvn or unrevealed?
That wais in 1930. Then Germany was
surrcptitiouEily arming. Wbst is Germany
doing to-day? She is arming openýly. Hitler
lias laslied the spirit of the people into a frenzy
of pi-ide and hatred. Supported by ninety-nine
per cent of the population, and with every
man in the Reichstag, except one, now wearing his livery, hie lias abolisbed ail the states
and provinces, and ba-s even attacked tbe
powerfui Lutheran Cliurcbi. And where is bie
Icading bis people? Every day, by radio and
th)rolugh tbe press, be is driving bis people to
dlemand the old German hegemony of Europe.
Can thiat fact be denied?
1n(ler these cîrcumnstances is it possible for
France to disarm? If it is not, wby sbou'ld
the League bc repruached for not baving
accomplished the impossible? Tbe League is
composed of bumans. and there is a limit to
what it cain do. To disarm to-day wouýld be
te Icave Germany free f0 conquer by force.
The lionourable gentleman from Vancouver
said a fcw weeks age, upon bis return from
Germany, that if be were in tbe place of
France lie would go ie and "elean iip"
Germaev. I tbink those were bis words. But
vcntcrday tbe President of France said tbat
France weuld neyer be guilty cf a wvar 0f
aggression. France bas bound berself flot te
go to war, and will nlot gu to war except in
defence of tbe life andl liberty of ber people.
I: it fair to sav that the Leaguie bias failed
in the matter of disarmament, and in regard
f0 tbe Sino-Japanese confiict? There are
things wbicbi we sbou*ld not expeet the League
to dIo. at aIl events for the present.
The bonourable gentleman frein Edmonton
said tbat the League bad been emasculated,
and in large measure Canada was responsible. I do flot know that tbat statement can
be contradicted in toto. It is truc tbat wben
Canada found itself face to face witb article
10 of the ('ovenaýnt it realized fully tbe nature

In creating the League the

came to the maneing of tbe trenebes, the
United States were missing, and Canada's
flank, te use a reilitary expression, was "left

it net natura] tbat Canada sbould explain to

Great

down bis questions, I shall be very sincere in
attempting to answer themn later on.
Now, honourable gentlemen, my purpose is
simply to show that we have gone as far as
we could ta help the League. The situation
would bave been ideal if ail the nations had
joined together; then there would have been
little danger, if any, af war, because an
aggressor would have faced a coalition of
the great nations of the world. But when
the United States withdrew, and the signature
of their Preoident was denied, conditions
changed. War became much more feasible,
if not probable, and Canada had ta take
notice of the change and shape ber course
accordingly.

There is onlY one way in, which that which
bas flot been done in the past can be brought
about in the future, and that is by education.
There is only one road open, the road of
propaganda.
Duringthis debate I wa-s greatly astonished
ta bear the apology for arma and for war.
I said ta myseif, "las it possible that we
should hear a piea for arms and war sixteen
years after the Great War?" StilI the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black) read an article which stated that war
was every day becoming more humane. He
said that as arma become more effective their
victims become less numerous. The honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.

gangsters? Do you think that gangsters
would figlit with bare knuckles? What are
the gangsters in Chicago flghting with? They
are fighting witb the armaments of war.
It is true that there have been wars since
the beginning of the world, but we have
reached a time when, if we want ta preserve
humanity and civilization, war must be vanquished. The honourable gentleman from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) stated that
the wars of aid had created greater havoc
than the GIreat War. When I heard him I
wondered. He spoke of 45,000 men having
fallen in the Battle of Waterloo. Surely he
bas forgotten Verdun, wbere within a space
easily swept by a glance, 400,000 Frenchmen
and 500,000 Germans fell, and where even
the foundations of the cities were obliterated.
Did he ever look at the little signboard which
marks the site of the town of Fleury?
I took the time ta look up an aid circular
tha-t was published sbortly after the War.
Just listen ta this catalogue of destruction:

is it recorded in history that war destroys

aoU

SENATE

My honourable friend has forgotten that more
than three-quarters of the factories of France
were totally destroyed. It was estimated, I
think, that seven-eighths of the entire industry of France was systematically wiped
out. Machinery was removed whenever possible, and in other circumstances it was utterly
destroyed. The destruction of railway lines
amounted to 2,400 kilometres, or 1,600 miles.
Of canals there were destroyed 1,621 kilometres, or roughly 1,100 miles. And 7,401
schools were demolished.
Honourable members, is it true that war is
becoming more humane?
Is it true that
armaments are not a menace to the world today? My honourable friend from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) is quite right when
he says we should not place blame on the
manufacturer of armaments, for, after all, he
operates under the sanction of national laws,
as the manufacturer of every product does.
The trouble is that with the growth in armaments there is a growth in international
suspicion and fears. Nations watch one
another, and when one of them thinks the
time to strike bas come it strikes, because it
knows that to delay would be but to play
into the hands of an enemy.
Let me quote from an authority who, I
know, is regarded with a great deal of respect
by all honourable members. On the llth of
November, 1930, the right honourable leader
of this House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
delivered a brilliant address at Washington
before the Good Will Congress of the World
Alliance for International Friendship. In the
course of that address, which made a deep
and lasting impression, he used this persuasive
argument:
Civilization bas to end war or war vill end
civilization. Do we believe that to be true
or do we not? If we do not, it surely is time
we did, and if we do, then this race of human
beings has to adjust itself to new facts, that
is. facts which never existed before; it has to
adjust to new tremendous facts, or pass out.
What are these facts? The chief one is this:
-Science

has given us so great a command over

the elements of nature that millions can be
sniuffed out in tIis d.ay in a mere matter of
moments. Where hundreds fell before in manly
contests arm to arm, great cities now, the
whole countryside, can e eaten up by the
insatiate maw of chemi-stry. As soon as war
got into three dimensions, that is, got into the
upper air and under sea, as well as on the
surface, vast possibilities were opened up.
When you get in three dimensions, weapons
come into play which cannot be matched with
other weapons and the issue decided as it bas
been decided in the past by a test of strength
and skill. Let me repeat. such a test cannot
be made in three-dimension war. Take the
submarine; the Gernians had only some thirty
in use at any time in the last great struggle.
These required ten thousand men. Against
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

those

thirty

submarines

were

arrayed

four

thousand surface vessels, great and small,
trying to suppress then; against the ten thousand men on the submarines were one million
trying to resist thein, and besides, immense
mine fields, shore batteries of cannon and all
kinds of immobile defences. In defiance of al]
these, the submarines destroyed eleven million
tons of allied shipping, and hosts of human
beings. In the air attack on Whitsun in 19-18,
there were only thirty-three planes carrying on
the offensive, and of these only six vere lost,
although they were opposed by one hundred
British planes and as w-ell by eight hundred
guns, four hundred searchlights and a whole
division of troops. Have we any idea of what
the submarine and aeroplane of to-morrow can
accomplish? Why, the French to-day can drop
in one raid one hundred and twenty tons of
bombs ten times the war maximum in weight,
and every ton ten times as powerful in explosive destruction. There is death and desolation
multiplied one hundred times already. In a
single factory in Germany there is produced
now two thousand tons per day of nitrate of
ammonia-compound which can be quick-ly converted into the most terrible of explosives. In
the whole course of the Great War there were
dropped in England only three hundred tons.
We have even British experts and American
experts arguing as to how many cruisers each
country is going to be allowed. General Groves
is authority for the statement that one hundred
modern aeroplanes in ten minutes can lay a
cloud of poison gas from fifty to one hundred
and fifty feet thiek over an area of one hundred
square miles.
Hov long would a thousand
cruisers last against a w-eapon like that?
Aeroplanes travelling three hundred miles au
hour, undetectable by sound, can carry gas
bombs vhich -ould depopulate London. The
only way these weapons can be met is by
reprisals. Reprisal will follow reprisal until
the civil population passes, this nation to-day,
that nation to-morrow, by millions into eternity.
What a forceful argument! And how true!
Honourable members, war should be outlawed.
When I listen to my honourable friends, one
a determined opponent and the other a reluetant upholder of the League who wishes to
reduce its functions virtually to those of a
benevolent and philanthropic association, I
feel compelled to ask them what alternative
plan they can suggest.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We could not have
anything worse.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What have they to
suggest? The League, in its organization, purposes and accomplishments, opens a tremendous field for study. Sir John Macdonald
used to say that it took a man seven years to
learn how to hang bis hat in the House of
Commons. Surely it requires a much longer
time to become familiar with the essential
facts concerning the League of Nations. I am
thinking not of the superficial knowledge that
is obtained from the reading of newspaper

MAY 15, 1934
articles, or mare often indeed fram, their beadings, but af what can be ascertained onl.y by
conscientiaus and dee'p study. Those who
have considered the mass of documentary evidence and have attended meetings of the
League will understand me when I say that
long and profound study is a necessary preliminary ta any criticism of wbat la being
attempted at Geneva. Surely, theref are, when
a man publicly condemns the League he
should in fairness he bound ta say what he
bas ta offer in its place.
Honourable members, do we want ta revert
ta the systemn which has kept the nations in
bandage fram the beginning of bistory? While
I listened ta my honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae) stating that Canada shauld endeavaur ta keep clear of war,
I was reminded of a wonderful description by
tbat literary genius af France, Victor Hugo.
Anyone wbo bas read "The Toilers of tbe
Seat' will recali the vivid tale of a man who
was seized by a devil-fisb and had his blood
sucked out by the encircling tentacles af the
manster. That is a very good allegory of
a nation in the grim clutch of war. Yet there
are peaple wbo laugb as tbougb war meant
notbing. But they would nat laugb at a
pestilence or any other scourge of bumanity.
Why should we destroy the League when
there is no suhatitute for it? What oould we
gain by its destruction? Critics say it is a
useless arganization, and that nations witbdraw from it wben tbey cannot have their own
way. I do not approve of Germany's witbdrawal, but I think I understand it. Lasbed
into a fury, the German people are bent on
acbieving the encbanting goal that has been
set bef are tbem, the domination of Europe.
Hitler bas promised them tbat he will restore
the aid boundaries cf 1914 and regain tbe
colonies lost during the War. But twa weeks
ago a declaration was made in the British
flouse of 'Commons that the Government
would not give up its pratectorates in Africa.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN:- Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What did that
declaration mean? It served notice on Hitler
that wbatever be migbt promise bis own
people, England was determined not ta give
back its protectorates ta Ge.rmany.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: "What we have we
bold."
flan. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, is the task -of the League impossible?
My honourable friend the leader on the other
sîde of the flouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
painted out that Cbristianity bas been in
existence for two thousand years, yet it bas

381

permeated only one-third of the world. To
judge by that experience, it might be feit
that the League would not oommand the support of ail nations in time ta avert another
catastrophe. But there is a difference between
the creed of Christianity and that of the
League. Christia.nity impofes self-sbnegation,
and teaches that good conduct ini this if e
will he rewarded in the next, while the
League endeavours to win men over to a
policy of seif-preservation, ta convince themn
that in order ta save their very existence they
must abandon war and agree ta live in peace.
Is there any sound reason why man should
flot practise in an international spbere what
he practi"e every day within his national
houndaries? It required welýl nigh one thousand years ta create the France of the days
of Richelieu. In times of aid. there was almost
continuous strife, city against city, palace
against palace, and even house against bouse.
But at last the people d.iscovered. bow foolish
it was ta pprsist in that savage insanity, and
they would have no more of the internecine
strif e that was eating into their very vitals.
As I have said, 1 can understand why Germany withdrew from the League. She wantis
ta reacquire the power she held before the
War. And I can also undtrstand the position
of Japan. fier situ is ta remain a first-cass
power an the Pacifie. Without Manchuria she
can neither feed her people nor provide for
ber industrial neeLs. But what is the situation in Canada? Here we stand in no danger,
yet sonie of aur people are timaraus. We are
not loaded with heavy responsibilities and
burdens as they are in Europe, and yet @omne
of us have grown tired and disheartered.
If we withdrew from the League wbat a poor
example we shauid set aur neighbours across
the line, who we daily hope will ful-fil the
gloriaus promise they gave when the Peace
Pact was signed in 1918?
By way of encouragement for those pe'ople
wbo believe that, although we may be far
from. the goal, we have no reason ta be downbearted nor ta turn back, I will conclude by
quoting an extract from Sir Robert Bordeu'a
grand oratian at the eleventb Assembly of the
League, on the llth of September, 1WO:
I have said that we are bere as ohildren
in the kindergarten of peace. Is it conceivable
that we ean advanee beyond the kindergarten
until the world, shall have been freed, from the
mena-ce of armaments? Do I hear a whisper
that this is vain ideahiam? Let us thank Gad
thsit the idealism of one generation becomes the
achievement of the next. In my country thýere
are thousands of worthy and contented citizens
fromn every nation in Europe and from many
ather nationis. If I might interpret their
message, tbey wouldl bid you look farward and
nat backward. May not the dead past bury

its dead?

whien it ehalI be cast forth forever into the
outer darkne-ss of things accursed, its hrow
seared with the brand of eternal infamny.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members, while listening to this interesting debate I have asked myself why the
League of Nations was formed.
In my
opinion it was formed for the purpose of
bringing peace on earth, of persuading nations
to settie their disputes by arbitration rather
than by recourse te war; not for the purpose
of bringing about order and good government
throughout the world.
I have studied public opinion as expressed
in newspapers and magazines and as declarod
orally, and I have reached the conclusion
that tho League is wearing out its wolcome.
This is net becauso of adverse criticism of
its efforts te preserve peace. No one knows
whether the influence of the League has or
has net prevented an explosion in Europe.
Everyone does know that it failed, and
properly failed, te drive Japan eut of Manchuria. Itis success would have been a great
e vil.
It is said that Japan lias robbed China of
Manchuria. But Mancliria neyer belonged
to China; China belenged te Manchuria.
Ono mighit as well s:ay that England belongs
te Ircland. Befere tlie formation of the Irish
Free State and Northern Ireland, all the
world said that Ireland belonged te England
by righit of conquest; similarly China bclonged te Manchuria by right of conquest.
We .iustify ourselves-by "wo" I mean the
British Empire, from which evcryone soems
te be trying te tear us away-wo justify our
contrel of India hy the fact that anarchy
would ho let looso were we te haed over its
government te the natives. Under China's
feoblo administration Manchuria, was overrue by marauding bands of irregular treops.
Japan assumed control and set up a stable
government.
What differenco dees it mako
te the Manchurians whether 'they are uoder
Peking or Tokyo se long as they are in
peaceful onjovment of life aed property?
Certainly. if the faîlure of the League of
Nations te restore Manchuria te China is
the only sin of omission that can be charged
against it. I de net consider that a sufficient
reason for its abolition.
The growing opinion against the League is
founded upon the unreasonable cest of its
operatien.
The honourable member from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) said: "Why,
wvhat dees this cost ameunt te? It is a more
trille, equivalent te a contribution from each
Canadian of the prico of a three-cent postage

things the Loague had done since its inceptien. and the list ivas succiectly givon bx' the
honourable senator frem Edmenton (Hon.
Mr. Gricabach) when ho participated in this
debate:
Consultation, conference, international relatiens, econeinic relations, techeical organizatien. health, backward states and aborigines,
social and hiumanitarian, slavery, drugs, refugees,
epidemies, international law, registration of
treaties, and labeur relations.
'.V'ell, any ene ef these activitios might cause
war. I wender the League does net busy
itself with birth contrel, for certainl.r excessive population is a potential source of war.
I submait, heneurable gentlemen. it is
abselutely unjustifiable that S300.000 cf this
countrv's meney should ho spont annuelly te
do the scavenger work ef Europe anI Asia.
The League wvas formcd primarily te proserve
peece, net te dlean the streets of these continents.
W/e are erecting a super-state. for
the League seems te think it should police
evcry country on earth. Our people will net
tolerate such a policy. Lot the League stick
te its knittieg, lot it attend te the bus~iness
fer wvbich it was formed. But. like miany
other organizetiens, the League is seekinz te
ronder it.self important and te justiFY its
existence.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hoar, heer.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
Leigue, through its mimerons committees,
bu,4ies itself in elmost everything. these incclfold activities being embodied in hulky reports. The last report I reccived m-as on
malaria. I fency the League itself is affected
wvithi malaria. This misdirected energy will
in aIl probability bring about its destruction.
The purpose for which the League was
formed emply justifies its existence. It is a
good thing fer the representativeo of the nationýs ef the earth te got tegether, te rcb off
the rough edges ced learn te understand one
another.
But, like many ethor excellent
erganizetions, it seems inclined te lose sight
of its primary function and te disintegrate.
1 see there is e proposaI on foot te build a
palatial homo for the League at a cost of
$8,000,O.OO
Will any henocrable member tell me what
eerthly geod ivili resuit from eur sending each

te attend the meetings of the League are the
Prime Ministers of the member-nations. They

preserve peace.

;b

MAY 15, 1934
More and more every year the world is
becoming peace-minded. A definite change
has taken place during the last hundred years
in the outlook of xnankind with respect to
war. Search the literature of the last oentury
and you will find no great novelist writing
about war. The public took no particular
interest in war; they regarded it as a matter
of course. In short, they were war-minded.
Recently while reading the lif e of John Bright
I was very much înterested in bis challenge
f0 the Government of the day to justify the
Crimean War. There was really no justification for it. But althougb botb in Parliament
and on the public platform. he declaimed
most eloquently against the war policy of the
British Government, he failed to change the
course of events. It may be said that, in a
sense, the nations of Europe were in a state
of comparative barharism a hundred years
ago. Then the various governments placed no
greater value on human life than do our
motorigts to-day.
Now, why do we expeet war? Wbat reason
have we to think w-e are on the edge of a
precipice? After the Franco-Pruasian War the
publicists and press of Europe were every
day predicting a fresh outbreak. AlI my hfie.
from my youth up, I have heard rumours of
war, but for haIf a century the world enjoyed
peace. I repeat my question: why should we
expeet a war now? France is sick of war. If
we are to believe newspaper reports-and
surely we may believe at least haif of those
reports-France has fortified 'her frontier from
the Baltic to the Mediterranean. Germany is
said f0 be arming. What is she arming for?
Do honourable gentlemen tbin-k Germany will
undertake another war against France? In
1914 Germany was better armed and in every
way better prepared for war than any nation
in recorded history. Her crazy Kaiser boasted
that the War would be over before the snow
flew. Yet Germany was beaten in the first
seven months. Crushingly defeated then, is
Germany so grossly stupid to-day as to think
that she could conquer France? The idea is
absurd. And why should she seek to vanquish
France? Wbat is she going to gain? Su.rely,
after what bas happened since the Treaty of
Versailes, every nation is convinced that
nothing is to be gained by war. From my
observation and reading I arn onvinced there
is not a war cloud ini the eky. Apart from
newspaper writers Seeking after the sensational, very few people believe there is going
to he another war.
It seems to me that the honourable gentleman from EdLmonton (Hon. Mr. GTiesbach)

has disposed of the disarmament talk. But
supposing t-hat France, Germany, and all the
other great powers disarmed to-morrow,
would that ensure a continuance of peace?
In my view this step would be to the decided
advantage of GeTmany. She bas a population
of 60,000,000 or 70,000,000 as against France's
30,000,000. Surely this disparity in favour of
Germany would be provocative of war. I do
flot think there are any more burgiars because
of the use of revolvers. If aà-l revolvers were
destroyed and their manufacture forbidden,
there would he just as many burgiars in the
world. Men do not go to war simply because
they are armed. They go to war because
tfiey are provoked, hecause they are greedy,
be-cause of national hatreds and jealousies.
Those are the causes of war. The League of
Nations was formed to destroy or neutralize
those causes; not, as I have said, to do the
scavenger work of Europe.
Prohably it is not germane to, the subjectmatter of this debate, but as we are hearing
so much about the terribly destructive powers
of enemy air.pianes, I deem it wel to refer to
an article whieh appeared in a recent issue of
the New York Ti-mes fromn the pen of General
Bishop, an acknowledged authority on the
subi ect in the United States. Re contends
that airpianes are of no uise in war except for
scouting, and that it is ridiculous to think that
if hostile airplanes bombed New York the
United States would suifer defeat. He says
that even the virtuai destruction of New York
would not affect the ultiimate result. In his
opinion a war can be won oiily by infantry
supported by artillery. He points out that
anti-aircraft guns have been so perfected that
hostile aircraf t would be an easy target.
It is adinitted that a bombing plane can
do some damage. D.uring the War the Germans made an air raid on London. They
dropped a boimb in Temple Court, and the
ex!pflosion made a cavity six feet deep by
eight or ten feet in diameter. T-hey dropped
another bom-b in Chancery Lane and scooped
out another hole. That was the only damage
done in the narrow street. 0f course, a direct
bit on a irge body of men wou'ld cause many
casualties. But I amn inclined to share Generail
Bishop's opinion that it is a waste of time and
money to develop a large air force.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Casgrain, the
debate was adjourned.

information I had rccived as to discrimination
in the provision made in respect of the staff
of the Senate and that of the bouse of Gommons. Upon consulting the officers of the
Department of Finance I find that in item
No. 36 of schedule A, whîch relates to the

The officer who furnished the Estimates
explained that he had no knowledge that
there wou]d be similar requirements here. I

that without a similar item for the Senate
the work of this House would have to be
greatly curtailed-in fact, the expenses could
not be met. I have, however, received from
the Comptroller of the Treasury an assurance that, for the purpose of correcting the
error. the necessary moneys to carry on the
work of this Chamber and of its commîttees
wiIl be provided out of the appropriation for
unforeseen expenses; and, this being covered
by an undertaking in writing, I have no hesitation in mnoving the second reading of the

I trust that the officers of the Finance

Thc founding of the League of Nations was

But none of thc great powers surrendered,
or intcnded to surrender, any of their
sovereign rights, or really intended to, observe
the League's decisions any farther than it
suited their national aspirations and purposes
s0 to do. Under these circumstances it was
impossible for the League to, achieve any
large measure of success. It was inevitable
that its influence sbould gradually wane tilI
it would become of littie value.
NevcrthelIess, the mere setting up of the
League was an acknowledgment on the part
of the nations that some central authority

There are two kinds of power, material and
moral or spiritual, and when tbey work
together, as they al'ways should, the greatcst
possible good to the greatest possible number
is obtained. Unfortunately, bowevcr, they
do not alrways work together, and then we
have a world such as wc bave to-day. The
League of Nations has not now, and neyer

recognized as possessing much, if any, moral
or spiritual power. How, then, could it
accomplisb much?

only the material side of man; hence its
fundamental weakness.
Every age bas had its problems, which
differ littie in essentials, and if we make a
brief survey of history and sean some of the
troubles which our forefathers faced, and in
part, at least, overcame, it will surely belp
us to wrestle with the difficulties that beset
us in tbis our day. Let us consider events
in their chronological order.
There have been several great empires in
the world, which exercised considerable anaterial power. The greatest of them ail in
every material respect was the Roman Empire, which between the first and the fourth
centuries of the Christia.n era extended from
Mesgopotamia iii the east to, the Atlantic in
the west, and fromn the Sahara DeBert in the
south to the Danube and the Rhine li the
north. Its centre waïs Rome, which was based
on the Mediterranean, and fromn Rome it

power. Lt cornmanded peace by force, but for
no great length of time. Lt became unwieldy

however, because of its size, and local generals took over local governiments, which
weakened the central authority.
There was organized in the first century a
great spiritual power which, divinely guided,
establishcd its beadquarters at Rome, but
even without divine guidance it would have
been a far-seeing thing te do. The emperors
thought the new religion encroached upon
their divine prerogatives; hence the fierce
persecutiens of the Christians for the first
three centuries. But notwithstanding these
persecutiens, perhaps in part because of thema,
the profound helief that the crucifled Jesus was
G.od as well as man spread te, every part of the
Empire, and embraced ail classes of the
people. se that by the f ourth and flfth centuries there ivas no part of the then civilized
w.orld in which the Church had not boen firmly
established.
In the fourth century the Emperor Constantine, wbo bad been converted to Christianity, removed his seat of governiment to Constantinople, thus leaving the Western capital
and the Latin part of the Empire open to the
nertlicrn barbarians wlin werc crowding upon
it.
In the fifth century Attila, King of the
Huns, at the head of a victorinus army
carried death and destruction over a large
part of Europe, and flnallY campedl before the
gates of Rome. The Emperor fled; the people
ware panic-stricken. P'ope Loo I, with only
a few companions, went out of the city to
Attila's camp and pleaded with him se
earnestly that he agreed to spare not only the
city, but much of the surrounding country.
Other popes had somewhat similar experiences
with other barbarian generals, so that in time
the Church became the most powerful institution in ail the Western civilization, and the
people in large numibers leoked te the Bishop
of Rome and bis suffragans as the natural protectors of thceir civil and religious rights,-and
îlid flot always look in vain.
Between the fourth and the eighth centuries
Europe was almost a continueus battle-field.
The nortliern bordes were carrying fire and
sword ail over the soutbern plains, and civiliza

tenth century order was restored and civilizatien was airain making progress.

the princes of Europe against it. Hence the

united front that Europe presented to the
eniemy, the Western world would probably
have shared the fate of northern Africa.
Now, ivhat I wish to eall the attention of
the Senate to in this recital is the fact that
during these centuries ail Christendom, but
particularly Europe, recognized a central
spiritual authority which it believed to be
(lisinterested and capable of rendering fair
decisions, even in temporal matters. Thus
the popes were compelled by the exigencies of
thie times to intervene between ambitious,
foolish princes, and between princes and
peoples, and many a conflict was avoided and
many a dispute settled in this way. There
was. in fart, no other authority to intervene.
I know that writers and historians have calied
the popes amhitious, meddlesome, dangerous
mon; but as 1 read history I have concluded
that their interference was a necessity, if
flot a duty, and, considering the tremendous
difficulties and responsibilities of their position, it was a measurahle succcss. At ail events
it was much better than no interference at ail.
If was the only authority possible in the days
of which I have heen speaking. And, honourable senators, if this is God's plan-and much
proof could be offered to that effet-it is
the only authority that wili bring a@ven comparative peace to a distractedl world to-day.
The times to which I have alluded have
been called the "Dark Ages," but the centuries
when Europe was covered with sehools and
churches, the churches filled with the masterpieces of art; when amicabie relations existed

when much attention was paid to letters; when

convictions of all the people, and in the face
of tremendous difficulties they could carry the
flag of their faith to the grave of their Redeemer-those centuries should not, in my
opinion, be called "Dark." Such things could
not be done to-day.
The thirteenth century has been properly
called the greatest of all the centuries. That
century saw the real founding of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the dotting of the continent with similar institutions
of learning, each attended by not hundreds
but thousands of students. It saw the building of hundreds upon hundreds of churches
and cathedrals, and their adornment with the
masterpieces of sculpture and painting that
are still the admiration of the world. It saw
the formation of workmen's guilds, in which
the chief purpose was to excel in craftsmanship and character. There was no thought
of strikes or lockouts. Masters and workmen
recognized and performed their respective
duties. It saw great advancement in letters.
It saw the beginning of nearly all our
parliamentary or representative institutions
that we call democracy, which, by the
way, is fast disappearing in this century. Of
course, the thirteenth century would not compare with the nineteenth century in the application of the sciences and in the perfection
of the mechanical arts; but, after all, what
have these things done for us? They have
brought us, in the opinion of many, the dethronement of God, the enslavement of the
masses, and some colossal fortunes. They
have brought us hunger in the midst of
abundance, nakedness, anger, hatred, nation
arming against nation, brother raising his hand
against brother in deadly commercial war
and physical strife, and a loss of faith in
God and man. In the thirteenth century there
was much comparative peace; there was contentment; there was earnest striving after
better things. In a word, there was faith
in God and man, and therefore God had His
legitimate place in all the affairs of life.
I read in the Montreal Gazette to-day an
article by Professor Whitelaw, of McGill
University, entitled 'Civilization and Culture." It points out that "The terms civilization and culture are not synonymous, and the
fond assumption that a civilian estate of
human society means the same thing as culture is a gross illusion." He says we can
have great material progress with very little
culture, and that culture is the more important. There is another sentence: "Modern
civilization has gained profitably in some
directions and lost grievouslyin others." Ail
through the article, which I consider well
repays the reading, runs the thought that if

389

moral principles are overlooked, or even
lightly regarded, the nation or nations responsible wilI have to accept the consequence.
Between the thirteenth and the sixteenth
centuries a very great deterioration in morals
took place. Many men who were entirely
unworthy obtained high positions in Church
and State; greed and undue worldly ambition were rampant and society became
disintegrated. There were serious scandals,
with dire consequences. As Our Lord said,
"Woe to the world because of scandals. For
it must needs be that scandals come; but
nevertheless woe to that man by whom the
scandal cometh." The Church was assailed
by fierce opposition from without, but her
worst troubles came from within, and if she
were a merely human institution she would
have disappeared from the earth without
leaving a trace behind. She was grievously
wounded, but came through with faith and
vitality unimpaired, as the Council of Trent
and her work since then prove.
We should not, however, lose sight of the
fact that the churchmen of those days were
not as black as they have been painted. We
shall realize this if we consider for a moment
the things the party politicians of our own
and every other country say about one another in these days, and then remember that
political party differences of the present time
cannot even be compared with the religious
differences of the people in the sixteenth,
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
On Wednesday, the 2nd of May, I read a
startling article in the Toronto Globe under
the heading "Facts and Fancies," which, if
true, shows that Christianity is fast disappearing from the minds of a majority of the
people in the United States. This article is
only a further proof of what I referred to in
this House on another occasion when I mentioned an article by a Harvard graduate which
appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, and which
atated that nine young men and women out
or every ten who graduate from the secular
and some of the denominational American
universities are atheists. And this article was
never challenged by those whom it arraigned.
I am afraid conditions in Europe are no
better. We know what has happened to
Christianity in Russia; we bave some idea of
what it is contending with in Germany and
other European countries. If mind dominates
matter, and the spiritual controls the temporal,
need we be under any illusions in regard to
what ails the world to-day?
There is no such thing in the world to-day
as an international or catholic conscience.
Each and every nation is ready to take any
advantage it can of its neighbours. Even

390

SENATE

W. E. Gladstone admitted that as Prime
Minister of Great Britain he did things which
as a man he knew to be wrong; and if Gladstone did such things, and felt impelled to
do them, what may we expect from less
conscientious statesmen?
Now, I do not think the world can get
along without an international conscience, and
it cannot have such a conscience without an
international authority which it respects and
will obey. The Right Hon. Lord Dickinson,
writing in the Contemporary Review of last
March, says:
The world is losing the spirit of internationalism and, unless this can be revived, it
is of little use to talk about reforming the
League. All civilized nations must be brought
to realize that human progress demands not
only international peace, but international cooperationand, I add, international conscience as well.
Now I come to what appears to me to
be the pith of the objection of the honourable
senator from Edmonton to the League of
Nations:
There was a reference by the honourable
gentleman from Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener)
to soinething of which we frequently hear,
namely, the proposal to create a super state,
to lave the League of Nations considered as
a super power which would by force suppress
war and punish wrongdoers. That vas the
coneeption many people lad of the League
nlien it was formed. Those who believed that
articles 10 and 16 were to be the cardinal
features in the structure of the League envisaged to sone extent an organization which
nwould exercise police power throughout the
Well, what such people sonetinies
world.
forget is that a super state implies a super
conscience, a super will and a super justice.
Hon. Mr. Casgrain: And a super army.
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: It implies an overriding of national sovereignty, a surrender by
sovereign states of just those very features of
the national life to which the people, collectively and individually, cling most tenaciously.
A man clings to the free exercise of lis own
conscience in determining what is right or
wrong; he maintains his right to the exercise
of his will to do or to refrain fron doing;
and he is particularly desirous that justice
should prevail. I repeat, that the super state
would require the surrender of national conTherefore it is
science, will and justice.
obvious that if such a proposal is placed
squarely before the world, even the neanest
nations will not consent to its adoption.
Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton: Would the honourable gentleman allow nie to ask him a
question? Has anyone ever suggested a super
state such as he is defining?
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton: Where?
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: There is in England at
the present time a strongly supported movement
for the creation of a super state.
Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton: I am referring to
a league of nations, not private enterprise.
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: The people behind that
movement are supporters of the League of
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

Nations who realize that the League has failed,
but believe that it may be rescued .and given
the new status of a super state. It is to be
inferred fron their arguments that what
many of them want is an international police
force. Now, it is impossible to conceive of
such a force without a conscience to direct its
noveientHon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton: Have we surrendered our conscience and our rights to our police
force?
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: Oh. no. We gave very
grudgingly, and we have taken some of the gift
back.
Hon. Mr. Hughes: The honourable gentleman
froi Hamilton is referring to the local police
force.
Hon. Mr. Griesbach: I am sure he does not
mean that, because we are net discussing it.
Wbat I meant to say was the Dominion
police force, not the local police force. But
even with ýthis explanation my interjection
was unnecessary, and the bonourable senavery
me
tor from Edmonton answered
correctly and very courteously.
As I see it, he thinks and speaks on this
question as a soldier, and not as a statesman. While there was much in his observations thtat was sound, there was a false
note running all through them, which the
(Hon.
honourable senator froni Hamilton
Mr. Lynîlh-Staunton) clearly detected. There
nay have been, when the League was established, some persons who envisaged such an
organization as the honourable senator froin
Edmonton defined, and there may 1e sone
persons who hold similar views still, but I
venture to say their number was and is small,
and they did net think and have not thought
deeply on the subject. I quite agree with
tie honourable gentleman that a league such
as he described would not get the international support that would enable it to
function; but if a league that could function
cannot be established and get the nccessary
international support, the world has retrograded during the last few centuries and the
last few decades, and we are far on the road
te a state of barbarism, in which international
society would be impossible.
Of course, it is elementary te say that no
family or no state is possible unless the
individuals who compose it surrender some
of their individual rights. In this surrender
they get far more than they give. There is
no person in the world free to do as he
likes, no matter how depraved or how exalted
he may be. Even the Chicago gangsters have
a boss gangster whom they must obey. And
I am sure that when we obey a leader in
this House we are not surrendering our
conscience and our will.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.

MAY 16, 1934
Han. Mr. HUGHES: Wben tbe honouýrable senator from EdLmonton wus giving
meritorious service ta his country as an
afficer in the late War, he exaoted obedience
from those below him, and gave willing
obedience to those above him. I1 arn sure
it neyer oocurred to him that be had surrendered bis conscience and bis will, or had
ceased ta be a 'responsible man. The fact
is, the world bas become so small, and
modemn life bas hecome se complex, that a
League of Nations and a World Court are as
necessary for the world as a Supreme Court is
for the nation.
A clear thinker and writer on "Man and
Society " well says:
It may be laid down sa a general principle
that the more complicated and numerous human
relations become, the more need there is of
governmental machinery to regulate them. The
more persons deal with one another and the
more their juridical relations are multiplied,
the greater becomes the need of rules and
sanctions of government. This principle explains the vast increase of social legisiation in
the United States during the past five decades.
The ilcrease has been even more rapid in
densely populated countries, such as Gerrnany,
Great Britain and France.
Similarly, the
relations of nations with one another have increased markedly since the close of the past
century. and there is urgent need of international law ta define in world terme the
and their
various
rights of straining of nations ta say thatcitizens.
It is no the
logic
if the
doctrine of the "brotherbood of man" dictates
the need of law and order within a nation, it
dictates with equal urgency the need of law
and order among nations. The brotberhoad of
man does not stop at political boundaries.
Eitber it is ca-extensive with humanity, or it
bas no meaning whatsoever...
As the individual citizen needs the state, the
state needs an association of states. In other
words. as the individual citizen cannot live a
normal if e without a state to whicb he cedes
some of his freedom of action, the state cannlot f unctian properly without a power ta which
it cedes somne measure of its automony. As
the good of the individual is the purpose of
the state, the good of the state is the purpose
of a world association of states.
0f course, there are alternatives to a League
of Nations. We may nurse aur national pride
and cultivate aur national animasities, and
refuse to surrender any part of aur national
sovereignty; we may go on preparing for
war and making war tilI Europe becames a
desert, or tili one nation becomes 8o strong
that it will dominate -ail the others and enforce peace. In that event what would becorne of the sovereign rights of wbich we had
been sa careful? And then there is the possibility that wben we should have about destroyed ourselves, an Asiatic nation might tske
charge of us ta save us from ourselveel In
that event aur pride would be a littie hurt,
I suppose, but we should have fought for aur

9

savereign rights,-and wbat mare cauld white
men do? We sometimes look wîth pity, and
even contcmpt, upon the "hetathen Chinee"
because he cannot settle his disputes and protect himself frorn his enemies, but the day
may not be so far distant wben Europe, will
flot be able ta look with contempt upon anybody.
While I should like ta see a properly constituted League of Nations, properly supported and functioning in a manner ta gain
world respect, I arn afraid that a league
possessing temporal power only would neyer
reach tbat end. As I see it, God cannot be
lef t out of the rcckoning, and the spiritual
side of man eannot be overlooked. The
divîded state of Christendam, bowever, gives
little hope that rnuch can be donc in this
direction in our day.
Wbile the bonourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis) was speaking on this
question a fcew days ago, be incidentally mentioned a phenomenon whicb receives Iittle
attention from legisiators. He said that the
spiritual power at Rame reigned over and
managed more than 800,000,000 persoa. And
I add, these people are of cvery race, tribe,
color and tangue under the sun; tbey are
scattered aver the entire face of tbe globe,
yet thcy are united as one man in doctrine,
worsbip and government, and wbile there are
many questions ta settle and diecisions te
render, there is less friction than in sorne
families, and in some congregations, and certainly far less friction than in sorne bomogencous states. This marvellous accomplisbrnent
is sure.ly proof of what a central spiritual
power can do, for there is not even a hint
of any otber kind of power. The world in its
troubles and difficulties could surely get a
tesson bere, and it could get more than a
lesson; it could get assistance and ca-operation for the asking. But pride standeth in
the way. Will it ha always tbus? There
are some things happening in the world which
give men of goodwill a littlc hope. Tbere
appears to be a great lýonging in Cbristendom
for more unity, but if it carne it muet be
under the banner of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ernotionalisin can never take the place of
faitb. In fact, cmotionalism may be a bindrance rather than a help; it may be a device
of the enemy.
If my reading of history is at alI correct,
and if my conclusions are soundly based, the
way of salvation lies in a return ta the principles, and, as far as possible, to the practices
of the tbirteenth century. The details of what
such a rcturn would mean, in the social arder,
have been clearly set out in the encyclicala
tbat have been issued frorn the Vatican in the

392

SENATE

iast forty or fifty years. But, again I say, I
doubt whether the world would flot rather go
down ta destruction than follow such a course,
and that is why I ar n ot hopeful in regard
to the future of the Caucasian race.
As I see it, the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) is to be congratulated on moving this motion and inaugurating this discussion. Our remaining in
or withdrawing fromn the League should be
largely governed by the sincerity or insincerity
of the great powers in their dealings with it.
If the powers, particularly the Mother Country, are sincere in trying to prevent another
war, and are trying to make this a better
world in which to live, we sbould be with
themn heart and soul. But if on the other
hand thev are ail trying to outwit and outmanoeuvre one another, and are using the
League for their selfish national purposes,
what good could we do by remaining in the
League?
By the Treaty of Versailles Germany was disarmed to the full extent the victorious nations
desired, and they ail promised to disarm
accordingly; but not one of themn has kept
that promise. Can tbey expect such cynical
disregard of solomn promises to bear good
fruit? Again, when Germany was admitted
to the League, in 1926, she was distinctly toid
that her entry gave her equality of rights; but
this promise was not kept. Can she be blamed
for withdrawing from the League and rearming in spite of it? I read an English magazine called The New Commonwealth, pubIished for the promotion of international law
and order. One of its founders and contribit bas rnany other
titors is Lord Die.and
eminent men in Great Britain and on the
Continent as supporters and contrihutors. It
declared recentiy that some time ago the proposai to abolish aIl aerial warfare was made
at Geneva, and was supported by France and
sorne other continental countries, but opposed
by Great Britain and therefore lost. I sbould
like ta know whetber Canada voted on that
proposcil. and, if so. how.
The honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), whose views
deserve consideration and respect because of
bis years and experienco and bis knowlcdge of
this subi ect, bas toid us that the smaiier
powers hesitate to express tbernselves at
Geneva lest the.v mav displeasc the great
powers. 'But," he said, "it is not so with
Canada." I was very glad to bear this. I
should therefore like to know whether Canada
spoke and voted on the proposai to abolish
aerial warf are. And 1 should also like to
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

know why the great Powers should be offended
when the truth is spoken by the sinaller nations. I have long been told, and I have long
believed, that Great Britain did flot change
ber foreign policy witb each change of government. The honourable leader on this side
of the House bas told us, and several publications in Great Britain tell us, tbat thîs is
not true as regards ber policy with respect
to the League of Nations. This is a disturbing tbing to know.
The honourable senator fromn Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) characterized the suggestion of the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MôRae) for the outlawing
of private armament manufacturers as "'arrant
nonsense." I was surprised at this because,
if I mistake not, Colonel Drew, of Toronto-whose views the senator fromn Parkdale quoted
extensively-agrees witb tbe senator fromn
Vancouver, and I know that many respectable
publications and many prominent mon in
Great Britain hold views similar ta those expressed by him. In fact, common sense tells
us that if the great powers go on manufacturing armaments, or ailowing their nationals to do sa, selling tbemn to everybody
who wiil buy them, there is little sincerity in
their professions of peace. I think it was
Colonel Drew who told us a few years ago
that we need not expeet the private armament manufacturers to be put out of business
whîle Cabinet Ministers in Great Britain and
others countries, merchant princes, royal
princes and even bisbops were shareholders in
these eoncerns.
Now 1 corne ta the question of our membership in the League-whether ta be or not ta
be. And here let me say that I subscribe ta
rnuch that the honourabie senator from
Edmonton said in regard ta the Britisb Commonwealth of Nations. Hence I would not
think of aur withdrawing from the League
without first consulting the Mother Country
and the sister Dominions; and cven thcn I
should consider the matter very carefuly,hecause even a shadow of central authority
and international conscience is better than
none at ail.

LEAGUE 0F NATIONS
MOTION-DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed the adjourned dehate
on the motion of Hon. Mr. McRae:
That this House is of the opinion that Canada
should withdraw from membership in the
League of Nations, and that no further money
should be voted to the League.
Hon, C. R. WILSON: Honou-rable gentlemen, were it nlot for the interpretation given
hy Germany to the motion of the honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
concerning the withdrawal of Canada from
the League of Nations, the members of the
Senate would have every reason to be gratefui to the honourable gentleman, for he bas
given us the opportunity of listening to many
able opinions on the subjeet. I question my
own ability to contribute anything of value
to the debate, but I should not be faithful
to my position as a member of the National
Executive of the League of Nations Society
in Canada did I not endeavour to reply to
some of the criticisms levelled at that society.
In the first place, the honourable senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) has
said that the League of Nations Society in
Canada bas fallen largely into the hands of
pacifiste. I feel that the honourable senator
bas not followed the work of the League of
Nations Society in Canada very carefully.
On the National Council he will find many
who have excellent war records, and the
Canjadian Legion et their annual convention
in March, 1934, passed resolutions very
strongly endarsing the work of the society.
I shahl read one or two:
Therefore be it resolved that the Canadian
Legion will at aIl times co-operate with the
other organizations in support of the principles
of )the League of Nations and in promoting
knowledge of its work and possibilities and of
its influence in the interest of peace.
And particularly do we offer our co-operation
and assistance to the League of Nations
Society in Canada in its efforts to promote a
thorough understanding of the League and its
activities.
And whereas the League of Nations offers
the only existing alternative to the settlement
of international disputes by force,
Therefore be it resolved that the Canadian
Legion expresses its approval of the educational
prograni of the League of Nations Society in
Canada and pledges its support.
During 'the winter the League of Nations
Society and the Association of Canadien
Clubs sponsored a program of eleven radio,

addresses, of which nine were given by men
and two by women. Among the maie speakers
werc: Captain the Honourable Dr. R. J.
Manion, M.C., M.P. (Minister of Raiiways
and Canais); Major Jim Macdonneil, who
went ovenseas as a junior officer and returned
as a Brigade Major with D.S.U.; Mr. Brooke
Claxton, who served in the ranks and was
awarded the D.C.M.; Lt.-Colonei George A.
Drew, V.D.; and, finaliy, the National Secretary of the Lvagua of Nations Society, Professor T. W. L. MacDermot, who served in
the ranks and was rccommanded for a comnmission. This shouid bc sufficient to refute
the charge.
1 know that. with practically every other
Canadian, the honourable senator cherishes a
warm admiration for Sir Arthur Currie, whose
death is a great loss te Can-ada. Addressing
the Universit 'y Veterans' League un November 1l, 1933, Sir Arthur Currie stated:
In 01w deliberata and final thoîîght. as
returnd min. wva have faithi that these
mnonents of di-uouiragenient are fieeting. and
perhaps iniisleading; that those whobse niernories
we especially cherish did isot inaka their
sacrifice in vain, and that iii the end the sterD
deterinination of millions of inen and womien.

pacifism., will prevail over those whose views
woîîld tendl to pcrpettnate the horrors of war,
eveni rhongli somie of tîlase latter înay ha scated
in the bighi places of national executive and
legisiative power.
From the elu(iw(nt weords quoted< yesterday
by the lîonoîîr:ble scnator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beauhien), we know that the able
leader of the Government in this Chambar
(Right lion. Mr. Maighen) is among those
criticizcd by the honourable sanator from
Westmorland MHon. Mr. Black).
I find also that the Riglit Hon. Stanley
Baldwin, a man flot given to, extravagant
fancies, bias saici: "Who does not know that
one more war in the West, and the cix ilization
of the ages will fail withi as great a crashi
as that of Romie?"
Again, Sir Frederick Whyte, speaking to
the ýCanadian ;Club in Montreai last February,
deciared that siîouid the institution known as
the collective s-ystem of international relations
break down, the worid wouid ha in chaos.
Even those most actiy aware of the weaknasses and shortcomings of the 'Covenant and
its operation during the past fifteen ycars
have never been shaken in thair conviction
that the statesmen who drew up that document and set the worid on the path of international progress had the correct design in
their minds.
The honourabie senator from Westmoriand
endeavoured tu Jiruve by figures that war is
niow carriad on in a more bumana manner,
Han. Mrs. WILSON.

as a greater number of the combatants survive. For the wife or mother whio ]oses a
son or liusband, it makes littie difference that
99 per cent are saved if the one in whomn she
is vitaiiy interested loses his life or returns
home a helpless crippla. That war is carried
on in1 a more humane fashion, howaver, was
effectively disproved yesterday by the hionourable senator from Montarvilia, for hie gave
a most vivid description of the slaughter and
devastation of the late world confiict. It is
net necessary for me toeaniarge upon this.
After lisiening to the honourabie senater
from Westmorland I was curious enough te
re-read the chapter of the Fair Maid of Perth
which recounts the figlit between members
of the Clan Quhiele and the Clan Chattan.
There were thirty-two engaged on each side,
and 1 iearnad that the combat was deliberateiy st:rged for tihe purpose of ridding the
southern part of Scotland of these dreaded
marauders. But one, the voung chiaftain of
the Clan Quhele, ascaped unwounded, oniy
to throw himsclf later into a raging torrent.
On the other side there were seven survivers,
ail more or iass sariousiy wounded.
As te tIre larger percentage who may survive fromn actuai hattie, no mention was made
of the improved transportation and nursing
and miedical services. One lias onlyv to read
cf the condition Florence Nightingaie found
in tIre Crimea te have soe
iinderstanding
cf what f irse services mean.
In any case, is it reasonable that because
certain condlitions once prevaiicd they should
persist?
Boys in feudal days wvcre rarely

The exportation of armanients is now receiving soine attention in the British flouse
of Commons, and questions are being asked
to wbich no satisfactory replies have yet been
received. The newspapers this morning report:
Partially answering the clamoring of opposition members of the flouse of Commons as to

in addition there were 1,200 three-inch shelîs
and a sinail amount of other equipment sent
to Paru.
On iny recent visit to Westminster I
beard tha Labour member froin Glasgow,
Maxton, ask the Prime Ministar if anytbing
was to ha done to prevent the exportation of
armaments to foreign countrias. On being
told that this must be a matter of international agreemant, Maxton replied, "Was the
rîgbt honourable gentleman aware that during
tbe last war British soldiars bad bean killad
by weapons of British manufacture ?"
In bis speech in support of bis resolution
the bonourable senator from. Vancouver advocated the "total discontinuance by all nations
of tbe manufacture and sale of armaments.
Such a policy fully enforced would end war."
I ain fully in accord witb tbis plan, for if
only a very amaîl portion of our information
witb regard to the machinations of the various
armament manufacturers of Europe is correct,
tbey cannot but exercîsa a vary provocative
and sinistar influence. In this time of universaI depression their business bas flourishad.

of Commons, that Viekers were advertising
tanks in tha Garman press. She produced evidenca, including a latter from the advertisîng
manager of a paper, to refute Sir John Simon's
statement in Parliamient that the paper in
qucstion had a large public outsidé Germany.
It appeared, in fact, that less than 800 copies
went abroad. The advartisemants, said Sir
Herbert Lawrenca, were designed for "their
old and. valued clients" in South America.
Tha effeet of this confession was somewbat
spoilt by another shareholder observing that,
if this were the sole object of the advertisements, for a very sinall part of the saie expenditure eacb of the old and valued clients
outsida Germany could ha sent two circulars
in bis own language instead of one advertisement in Garman. 0f course, nobody accuses

395

Viekers of flot playing fair according to the
rules of the game. But what is the gainethis gaine of private traffie in arins?
In his speech on February 1, 1934, the
honourable senator from, Vancouver said:
When I refer to the League of Nations and
criticize its work 1 amrn ot overlooking the
many good things it has done. I amrn ot
unmindful of the splendid work it did with
regard to narcoties, the white slave traffle and
miany other things.
It was, therefore, a great surprise to me
to listen to the honourable senator fromn
Hamilton yesterday. Hie appeared to think
the League of Nations had no concerfi with
health, labour conditions, ili treatment of subject races, etc. Surely the spirit of the League
is to bring about a better world for ail, and
to bear in mind the principles of the Sermon
on the Mount.
A bundrcd years ago bealth was largely a
matter of individual concern, or, at best, it
was a family concern. If a man had amalipox that was bis own bard luck. Ooly within
comiparatively recent years bas tbere developed
the idea of bealth as a national responsibility.
Now it is a matter of international concern.
At its second meeting, in February, 1920, the
League Councîl decidcd to summon an International Conference of Health Experts to
draw up the constitution of tbe Health Organization under the paragraph of the Covenant
wbicb declares that the members of thbe
League shall "take steps in matters of international con*cern for the prevention and control of disease." When this Conference met,
in April, 1920, it was faced with the menace
of the typhus and ralapsing fever epidemnies
in Eastern Europe, whicb, originating in
Russia in Asia, bad spread to the eastern
marches of Poland. This was a inatter whicb
concerned not Poland alone, Germany alona,
or Norway and Sweden alone; it concarned4
the wbole family of na.tions, and as a mattar
of common concern the League's Healtb Section took it up. A sanitary cordon was tbrown
across Poland and the typhus was stopped in
its tracks. Not a single case seeped through
tbe lina, becausa behind tbat line y.ou had
the brains and resources, not. of one nation,
or of three or four, but of fifty-five nations.
In adition to the League there is an International Labour Office, whose work is to introduce the saine rules of peaceful co-operation
into the world of labour. War is partly
caused by unequal working conditions, unequal costs of production, and injustice to tbe
worker. Tbe Labour Office has drawn up
caraful agreements wbich countries can sign
and apply in order to improve labour conditions and make them. more uniform over the
world.

SENA TE

The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Lewis) to]d us that of the great empire
of the past, founded upon force, very little
trace remains to-day, but that the influence
of the empire founded by the Prince of Peace,
whýo came as a Babe to Bethlehem over 1,900
years ago, still peruicates the world, and will,
if only carried forward, accomplish much.
We have been expecting much of the League
of Nations, but that great ideal can progress
only as we give it our support. It may mean
some present or future sacrifice for each
nation which agrees to support the collective
system; but surely the condition of the world
to-day bas sbown us the futility of selfisb
policies.
Canada is a land of many nationalities, ail
living under one flag and unhampered by tbe
feuds wbich bave made of Europe a battlefield. For that reason, siirely we may with
a clear vision strive, by the only means yet
offered to man, te bring the world to see the
futility of deciding its differences by war.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Chapais, the debate

LEAGUE 0F NATIONS
MOTION-DISCUSSION CONTINUED

The ýSenate resumed from Wednesday, May
16, the adj ourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. McRae:
That this, House is of the opinion that Canada
should withdraw from memibership in the
League of Nations, and that no further money
should be voted to the League.
Hon. T. CHAPAIS: Honourable members
of the Senate, I feel bound to say a few
words to explain the vote that I arn going to
give on the motion proposed by our honourable colleague from. Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae). And in doing so, 1 shall try to
remain strictly within the limits of the question which bas been submitted to our consideration.
If I arn not mistaken, 'the purpose of this
motion is to get Canada out of the League
of Nations, firstly, because our inerbership
might involve our country in a new war, and,
secondly, because the League is sucli a failure
that it would be expedient and wise to sever
our connection with a useless institution which

brîefly as possible, that these two, propositions
are groundless.
It is perfectly true that article 10 of the
Covenant, which is the foundation of the
League, imposes an obligation on the states
signing that historical deed. Here is the
wording of that article:

397

10. The members of the League undertake to
respect and preserve as against externat aggression the territorial integrity and existing
political independence of ail members of the
League. In case of any, such aggression or in
case of any threat or danger of such aggreasion the Council shahl advise upon the means
hy which such obligation shall be f ulfilled.
It cannot be denied that an obligation is
enacted by this article. But let us discuss
the extenit oif that obligation. Four years
after the signing of the famous Covenant an
interpretation was sought by the Canadiýan
delegation and adopted by the Assembly at
Geneva. It took the following forrn:
The Assembly, desirous of definiog the scope
of the obligations contained in article 10 of the
Covenant so far ais regards the points raised
by the Canadian delegation, adopts the following resolution:
It is in conformity wîth the spirit of article
10 that, in the event of the Council considering
it to be its duty to recommend the application
of military measures in consequence of an
aggression or danger or threat of aggression,
the Council shaîl be bound to take account
more particularly of the geographical situation
and of the special conditions of each state. It
is for the constitutional authorities of each
member to decide, in reference to the obligation of preserving the independence and tL
integrity of the territory of members, in what
degree the mesnber is bound to, assure the
execution of this obligation by employment of
its rnilitary force. The recommendation made
by the Council shall be regarded as being of
the highest importance and shaîl be taken into
consideration by all the members of the League
wi*th the desire to execute their engagements
in good faith.
Only one member of the Assembly, Persia,
voted against th.is proposition. So it was not
adopted unanimously. The honourable senatoir
for De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has
already quoted that resolution. But I want
to emphasize what took place on that important occasion. According to an official
publication of the seeretariat at Geneva,
which I have here, the President of the
Asse-mbly declared that the negative vote of
Persia could not render nuil and void what
And he stated that,
had taken place.
"following a precedent, the proposition would
not, be considered as rej ected; for it waa impossible to maintain that the Assembly, by
its vote, lied dec1sored itself in favour of the

contrary interpretation."
publication which I arn quoting goes on to
state, "that it shail be deemed that, for any
question in connection wîth article 10, the
Council and members of the Le'ague would
have in mind the debate in the Assembly
and the proposed interpretative reeolutions of
article 10." All this means that, as a matter
of fact, the interpretation of article 10 shal
be in conformîty with the reeolution of 1923,
adopted unanimously but for one vote.

ff8

SENATE

Now let us see the deep importance of
that resolution. It states that:
It is for the constitutional authorities of each
member to decide, in reference to the obligation of preserving the independence and integrity of the territory of members, in what
degree the member is bound to assure the
execution of this obligation.
It is for the constitutional authorities of
each state to decide. Honourable members,
are our constitutional authorities not ourselves, our Parliament, our Government? So
under the Covenant and its authorized interpretation the Canadian people would remain free to make their own decision, and
would in no way be bound to take an active
part in a future wýar.
But this is not all. Leaving aside the constitutional question, there is another consideration and a most important one. Even if
we were bound to go to war, even if we should
go, even if we would, even if we wished, who
would dare to say that we could? There is
such a word as impossible, and there is such
a thing as impossibility. What would be the
situation of a man of military age, in the
prime of life, full of courage and of earnest
patriotism, but utterly disabled during a
previous war, if one day he saw the dark
cloud of bloody conflict burst again over bis
beloved country? His heart would leap towards the battle-field and the clash of arms.
But he could not shoulder a gun, for he is
maimed, powerless, disabled. Well, a nation
also may be disabled. The great War loaded
our country with the crushing weight of over
one 'billion dollars of debt. In interest alone
we paid last year nearly 8135,000,000, that is
to say $90,000,000 more than the total expenditure of Canada, ordinary and extraordinary,
thirty-eight years ago. Staggering under such
an overwhelming load, what could Canada do
if war were to rage again in the old world and
flood once more with torrents of blood the
accursed fields of Europe? Would she not
be absolutely debarred from taking an active
part in the deadly struggle, for the very striking reason that another billion of dollars
added to ber present extreme burden would
break the back of the Canadian taxpayer?
"A l'impossible nul n'est tenu," as we say in
French. Were it only for such an evident impossibility, Canada would inevitably be kept
out of the dreadful conflict.
Thus from constitutional, financial and
economie viewpoints it can be safely asserted
that the continuation of our Canadian membership in the League of Nations would in no
way inflict upon us the obligation of actively
participating in a new European war.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

Let us now inquire whether the League is
in such a state of uselessness, of docay, of
impotence, that a country like ours should
feel bound to desert it, to break ber connection with it.
I must confess that I am not very
optimistic as to the achievements of the
League. I admit that it has not justified all
the fervent hopes which greeted its birth.
After fourteen years the universal and stable
peace which the great amphictyonic Council
of Geneva was supposed to foster in the world
is far from being a blissful reality. Ominous
clouds are darkening the sky.
Military
preparedness seoms to be a common password.
Suspicion and fearful distrust keep powerful
nations on the alert. The long-desired and
long-adjourned disarmament is more remote
than ever. On the contrary, we see with
mournful astonishment the opening of a new
race for more guns, more soldiers, more
armed airplanes, more battle-ships, more
scientific and destructive instruments of death.
All this is true. But it does not prove
that the usefulness of the League of Nations
is entirely gone. To my mind it proves quite
the reverse.
True it is that the Geneva
Council and Assembly have not always succeeded in preventing conflicts. True it is
that they failed in Asia, and again in South
America. True it is that on many occasions
their efforts towards peaceful settlement and
conciliation were doomed to failure. But
what if there had been no League of Nations
during the thirteen years just elapsed?
A
greater number of conflicts would have been
pushed to their bitter end. Undoubtedly the
League has not established universal security
and universal harmony. But it has prevented
some dangerous clashes, namely, between
Poland and Lithuania, between Finland and
Sweden, between Germany and Poland, between Great Britain and Turkey, to mention
a few cases. And through the great Court
of International Justice it has exerted its
pacifying influence in litigation between
France and England; between England,
France and Italy on one side and Germany
on the other; between England and Greece;
between Poland and Czechoslovakia; between
Germany and Poland; and so on. These
facts should not be forgotten.
Moreover, at the present moment would
the situation in Europe, indeed in the whole
world, be in better shape, be more reassuring,
if there were no League of Nations? Even
with its deficiencies, its failures, the League
is an institution whose weight and influence
are on the side of peace, of goodwill and
conciliation.
On a would-be aggressor the

399

MAY 22, 1934
existence of the Geneva institution must have
a deterrent effect. The League is still a staying, a checking power. And even with its
insufficient machinery, with its impediments
and its shackles, it could in a perilous emergency be the safety valve which would stop
a disastrous explosion. Is not such a possibility a sufficient justification for the League's
existence?
Turning to another side of the question, let
us consider the good work accomplished in
many fields by the League of Nations. A
recent number of "Interdependence," a quarterly review of the League and of international
affairs, gives this synopsis of its work:
In 1919, a number of states pledged them-

ated by so many eminent minds, including
the great Sovereign of the small Vatican
State. Such a desertion, for the paltry sake
of saving yearly $300,000, would not, in my
humble opinion, be worthy of this House,
of this Parliament, and of the Canadian
people.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members are aware that our principal work
now is in the Committee on Banking and
Commerce. In view of the absence of the
honourable senator from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain), I take the liberty of
m'oving on his behalf the adjournment of the
debate to enable the Committee to meet

a covenant which provides ways of acting in
co-operation. They paid for the establishment
of a secretariat or civil service for transacting
their business, and in the years that have
passed that secretariat has accomplished a vast
amount of work. The secretariat is equipped

epidemics, the effect of economie depression on

such matters. All of them are of world importance and have to be dealt with as affecting the

International Labour Office, whose work is to
introduce the same rules of peaceful co-operation into the world of Labour. . . .

Then again

there is the Permanent Court of International
Justice at The Hague for the arbitration of
disputes between nations. On it all the great
countries are represented, including the United

States, and it has already dealt with several

important questions.
Taking all those facts into consideration,
one can readily understand the feeling which
prompted this utterance of Sir Robert Borden
at the beginning of the present year:
There are those who, during the past twelve
months, have poured scorn upon the League of
Nations and upon its alleged failures in recent
years. I rejoice that from first to last I have
given to the League my warm support; and I
challenge contradiction when I affirm that if
the League should disappear to-morrow, the
world would still be truly its debtor for influence and service, impressive and enduring.
I do not wish to take further advantage
of the indulgence -of any of my colleagues.
I have tried to prove that our membership
in the League could not bind us to an active
participation in a new war; and that the

League, far from being such a failure as to
command our retirement, has done enough
good work to justify our continued co-opera-

Canada should not play the part of a quitter.

THE TOURIST TRADE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. W. H. DENNIS moved concurrence
in the third report of the Special Committee
on Tourist Traffic.
He said: Honourable senators, yesterday
I presented to this House the third and final
report of the Special Committee on Tourist
Traffic. This Committee, as you will recall,
was appointed on April 26, "o consider the
immense possibilities of the tourist traffic"
and "to inquire as to the means adopted
by the Government looking to its encouragement and expansion." The Committee held
many sittings and heard the evidence of a
large number of witnesses representative of
all agencies, public and private, engaged in
the encouragement of the tourist trade. In
addition the Committee received briefs,
memoranda and suggestions from every province, and indeed from almost every community of any size throughout the Dominion.
The report now before this House has had
the unanimous endorsation of the Committee
itself.
In passing I might assure honourable members that my haste yesterday in the presentation of this report was due to the enthusiasm
and zeal with which I, in common with the
other members of the Committee, have been
imbued throughout our investigation of this
most important national question.
As honourable members will note from the
report, the peak year in tourist trade in
Canada was 1929, when, according to the
officiai figures of the Department of Trade
and Commerce, the value of this trade was
$309,000,000. By 1933 this volume had shrunk
to approximately $117,000,000; and, as the
report emphasizes, this shrinkage in tourist
revenue undoubtedly has created a condition
of emergency, wh'ich calls for prompt and
effective action at this session of Parliament.
Honourable metnbers will also note the
Committee has come definitely to the conclusion that the tourist trade of Canada is a
matter of great national concern, and that in
order to reap the full benefits of this trade its
promotion cannot longer be left to the provinces, municipalities and private agencies
throughout the Dominion. In other words,
this matter must be viewed and dealt with
from a broad Dominion standpoint, because
it is of such immense importance to the people
of the whole country and is capable of bringing into Canada enormous sums of new
money.
By way of showing the value of this trade
I may be permitted to quote from figures
indicating the size and growth of this trade
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

in other countries. The Committee received
official information that over a five-year period
revenues from the tourist trade in the island
community of Bermuda amounted to one and
a half million pounds sterling annually. California's tourist revenue has been $100,000,000
a year. Florida's revenue from this trade is
estimated at all the way from $260,000,000 to
$350,000,000 annually.
Maine's revenue in
1933 was $100,000,000 in round figures. And
the United States Department of Commerce
sets $3,000,000,000 as the value of the tourist
trade to that country in the last calendar year.
There has just come to my attention a
summary of an official report on the tourist
trade in Southern California. In t.hat section
of the continent expenditures by tourists last
year were 83 per cent greater than the growers'
income from its world-famous citrus industry.
It is estimated that if Southern California's
1933 tourists were assembled at one time they
"would more than populate a city the size
of Boston." Indicating the effectiveness of
the advertising campaigns that have been
carried on, the report states that these endeavours "have returned an average of thirtythree dollars to this section in tourist expenditurc for every one dollar spent in advertising."
Moreover, as the report adds, the money spent
there last year by tourists "filtered into every
channel of trade and employment" and was a
sum equivalent to more than $30 for every
man, woman and child in a given area.
As one who knows something of publicity
and its effects, I was particularly struck with
the evidence of a director of information
representing one of the provincial governments, that in the experience of his province
the decline in tourist travel in the past few
years was in exact ratio to the decrease in
aggressive efforts and tourist publicity. This
decrease was of course due to drastic reductions in appropriations, which proved to be
false economy and produced very serious
results.
The tourist trade is net a new subject, and
not only because of its familiarity te the
public generally, but because of its great
magnitude and financial importance, I was
somewhat surprised to find that it had net
been carefully studied by Parliament before
this date. I therefore hesitated to raise this
question in the Senate, but facts and figures
which came te my attention, denoting the
heavy falling off in Canada's tourist revenues,
impelled me to take the steps J did.
A study of the evidence and the findings
and recommendations of the Committee will
convince the members of this honourable
House that development of the, tourist trade

daughters of the Maritimes now living in and McKay! Who is W. J. Roue? He is
another country. If at the moment we lack the designer of scores of vessels, one of
adequate industrial development in Maritime which I consider one of the greatest publicity
Canada, we have a priceless asset in our assets Canada possesses, the schooner Bluenose
champion of the Northern
unmatched scenery and climate during the -undefeated
tourist season, and as members of the family Atlantic deep sea fishing fleets. Even at this
of confederated provinces we urge that special moment the designer of this magnificent

vessel is departing from bis native country
to accept a position in the United States.
The point I wish to make is this. We as
Canadians should be taught by history that
men of this type and vision should be encouraged to remain within their own country,
so that Canada should not lose the value
of their genius and ability. In the case of
an outstanding naval architect like the designer of the Bluenose, it seems to me that
a special effort should be put forward to take
advantage of bis services in the appropriate
federal department.
Similarly, in the field of aviation, how
many citizens of Canada are aware that the
first flight of a heavier-than-air machine in
the British Empire was made in this country?
This flight was made in the Maritime Provinces by J. A. D. M'Curdy, twenty-five years
ago. To me it seems distinctly unfortunate
from a publicity standpoint, if from no other,
that we have not somewhere preserved in
this capital city more tangible reminders of
Canadian pioneering on sea and land.
Aviation is bound to play an increasingly
important part in tourist travel, and those
most familiar with its development urge its
organization within Canada under an effective
national policy.
On behalf of the members of the Committee I take this opportunity of expressing our
appreciation of the co-operation of many publie officials, Dominion and provincial, and of
assistance and advice from representatives of
tourist agencies, transportation companies,
hotel associations and many other organizations throughout Canada engaged in the
promotion of tourist travel. We desire to
express our thanks to the Press of Canada
for its unanimous support of the work of the
Committee.
In conclusion I wish to thank all honourable members for the attention they have
given this inquiry and my brief presentation
of the Committee's report. The report is
now before this honourable body, and there
is but one additional consideration I have to
suggest-that of urgency. It is the unanimous opinion of the Committee that its
should be acted upon
recommendations
promptly, at the present session of Parliament.
I desire to
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
express the thanks of this Chamber to the
honourable gentleman from Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Dennis) for bis inspiring address, as well
as for bis diligent work in the Committoe
on Tourist Traffic, over which ho presided.
I desire also to convey our thanks to bis
fellow members of that Committee. They
have done a splendid work, as is evidenced
Hon. Mr. DENNIS.

by the concise and able report which bas
just been presented to us, and I think that
not only the Senate but the country at large
will express gratitude for the satisfactory
result of their labours.
I have noticed of recent years while visiting the great cities of Europe how freely they
endeavour, by every conceivable means of
publicity, to attract visitors from all parts
of the world. I may mention in particular
London and Paris. I have been impressed
by the advertising undertaken by the railway
companies of Switzerland, Germany, Holland,
Denmark, Sweden and Norway to herald to
the world the outstanding advantages of
tourist travel within these countries. I would
direct the attention of honourable members
to the fact that this advertising, whether
subsidized by the various governments or
not, is being carried on by railway companies.
This is quite natural, of course, for they are
the first to benefit by increased passenger
traffic.
As we are urged to take prompt action, I
would suggest that any organization formed,
whether or not it be a central bureau as
recommended by this report, should hasten
to secure the co-operation of the passenger
traffic men of the Canadian National Railways, the Canadian Pacifie Railway and the
Canada Steamship Company, in order to develop an energetic publicity campaign throughout the United States. Already those companies have donc a considerable amount of
advertising there to attract tourists to Canada. A central bureau of the type recommended, in conjunction with the various
transportation agencies to which I have referred, could set up a strong co-ordinating
committee, and so give greater impetus to
these publicity activities.
In view of the very special conditions under
which we are labouring, I am somewhat chary
of our asking the Federal Government to increase its appropriations, but I recognize that
the proposed expenditure would be remunerative to the country at large. I am convinced
that a central bureau, as recommended in the
report, could be set up at a minimum of
expenditure, with the co-operation of men
who have the necessary experience in this
class of publicity work. Half a dozen of
those who appeared before the Special Committee on Tourist Traffic are at the head of
publicity bureaus operated by various departments of the Government service. Others
are connected with the Canadian National
Railways-itself a Government-owned transportation system. The organization set up
need not be very costly, because the Govern-

MAY 23, 1934
ment bas at hand a number of officiais who
could be called upon to organize and mani
that bureau. I do flot know whether the
Goverament would feel obiiged to go outside
its own staff. I hope it wouid flot have to
do so, because, although the work so abiy
carried on by the honourabie senator from
Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis) bas been much
appiauded, the proposai bas been the subject
of some siight criticism on the ground that it
wouid necessitate the creation of another department of government. If that department
can be composed of officiais already in the
public service, that fact shouid be a sufficient
answer to those who fear the setting up of a
costly department.
I may say that I agree with ail the statements of my honourabie fTiend, and for
myseif, and on behaif of those who surround
me, I appiaud ail that he bas said and done.
Right Hon. ARTHUR METOHEN: Honourabie members. it is flot often that work
in either Bouse of Parliament in this country is done so expeditiousiy and efficiently as
the work of this Committee in relation to
tourist traffic. Without being at ail ungenerous to other members of the Committee, we can no doubt attribute this in
large measure to the energy and activity of
its Chairman. When that body was created
few of us thought it wouid terminate its
work so soon, or that it wouid accomplish
s0 much of a practicaI and definite character
within such a short space of time. I congratulate the members of the Committee
one and ail, and partieuiariy the Chairman, on the exampie they have shown the
other committees of this Bouse, flot to mention the committees of the other assembiy.
It is for the H.ouse to decide what is to
be donc with this report. The report, in its
many phases, recommends that a great degree
of additionai attention and some additionai
expenditure be devoted ta the encouragement
of tourist traffie in Canada. 1 intend to
support the recommendations in toto. I do
flot feel that my action in so doing amounts
to a commitment of the Administration with
relation to the expenditure; but it does
amount to this, that I as a member of this
House think it is proper for the Senate of
Canada to make these recommendations to
the Government of Canada at this time.
Aith'ough the tourist traffie, like ail enterprises in recent timee, bas suffered some
check, it bas devel-oped to very great proportions wiùhout much conscious effort, and certainly with littie co-ordinated effort, on the
part of governmental bodies. Consequently
it nxay 'be feit that this traffie will be a
74728-26J

403

source of income and profit to us, whatever
attitude the Government may take. But
there cornes a time when such trade must
have the attention of authorities if the
benefits and revenues derived from it are noV
Vo be seriouisiy and perbaps permanently
cbecked.
The hon-ourable member in speaking this
afternoon expressed surprise that so littie
thought had been given to the sources of
revenue from tourist traffic. He cited figures
showing the enorm-ous income received from
visitors in Canada and from our own people
travelling in this country. So impressive were
those figures that he found it difficuit to
understand why the tourist 'business had
not chaiieuged attention of administrations
and, like other industries in this country,
become the objective of governmentai encouragement.
The general condition of the public mind
the worid over, especially the mind -of publie
men, bas been sueh that effort and enterprise
were regarded as beneficiai only in proportion
to what they produced. Anything that did
not add to the worid's wealth, that did not
produce something, that did not increase the
volume of those thîngs that really eonstitute
wealth as expreascd in terms of money, has
been considered to have no reai value. The
oid expression, so much commended to us by
our fabhers, that that man did most for the
world who caused two blades of grass to grow
where only one grew before, bas been
regarded with a sort -of reverence. We have
feit that it contained the law and the
prophets.
But the experiences of recent years of
large-scale production do not at ail support
that attitude of mmnd. I think it can be
affirmed that we know to-day that what
is most beneficial is the circulation of the
insignia of wealth, rather than the mere uncontroiled production of what we eal] the
means of life, otherwise known as wealth.
The circulation of money is what determines
the general condition *of the people, and
governmental activities tenddngS tow-ards a
greater money circulation are most vital and
useful in this d-ay and generation. If we can
assist therefore in the passing of money from
one hand Vo another, we shahl be doing more
than by helping the multiplication of production without effective distribution.
IV is hecause of the realization -of this truth
that more and more attention is being given
to such subjeets as tourist traffic. Tourist
traffic is simply a force, a lure, en objective
that resuits in the distribution aud scattering
among the many of the accumulations which
formerly belonged Vo the few. Consequently

404

SENATE

it is opportune that we, realizing this truth,
address ourselves in some way to the task
of assisting in such distribution.
But I think-and this may be aside from
the immediate object of the honourable
senator and of the Committee-that we have
to do a great deal more. I think we have to
divert the force of taxation and guide it by
the very same principle that now impels us
to encourage tourist traffic.
The income which successful people in the
world to-day possess gives them a far greater
advantage than ever before over those less
bountifully equipped in the matter of talent
and otherwise. Remember, success is always
comparative. The leverage is growing because
of the tremendous mechanization of industry,
and the contrast is becoming more and more
startling day by day.
The revenues of successful people-and they
ought to be commended if their success is
legitimate-are necessarily applied in two
main divisions. First, there is the money
which they spend hour by hour and day by
day, and which goes into the hands of consumers-into the hands of their servants and
workmen, of people who produce consumable
goods, of those who are dependent upon their
use. Then there is the other division, the
surplus, commonly known as savings. The
money that goes into the first division is put
into immediate and permanent circulation;
and every dollar spent results in one
hundred cents' worth of employment. What
goes into the other division reaches an altogether different economic and social goal-a
destiny always lauded in days gone by, and
properly so. It is invested usually in the
bonds of some enterprise or of the state. For
a time every dollar invested produces a certain amount of employment, but the money
is out of circulation and the investment leaves
in its trail a residuum of debt which in the
end amounts te more than the debtor can take
care of. The world's debt to-day is the bane
of economists and statesmen. It has grown
te such tremendous proportions that in the
face of it we almost despair. The debt represents the accumulation of surplus income
of those people who are able te save, and the
residuum is so great that it constitutes the
worst problem the state has to face. The
consequence is that while there is progress,
as we regard and define progress, it is progress without prostperity, because there is net
that distribution of the world's wealth day by
day and year by year which is essential to
enable the other section of the population te
buy. So I think governmental policy must
Right

Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

more and more be directed towards the encouragement of spending and the discouragement of disproportionate saving.
It is true that we can never so direct policy
that saving will net be to some degree encouraged and made possible. Otherwise there
cannot be progress. But there is such a thing
as too much progress with too little prosperity
accompanying it, and that is the phenomenon
that we have witnessed during the last two or
three decades. We shall always have to direct
taxation in such a way that there will be an
incentive to save, particularly on the part of
those with lower incomes, and an incentive
to spend on the part of those with greater
incomes. The incidence will have to fall less
heavily upon income which takes the form of
spending than upon that which takes the
form of surplus.
Now, while this is net directly in line with
the motion before us, it is in line with the
principle behind the motion. The tourist
traffic is of benefit to a country even though
every tourist in that country comes from
within its own borders. There is of course
no addition to the aggregate of real wealth,
but there is benefit by reason of the fact
that the traffic stimulates the circulation of
wealth-and that is the vital need at this
time.
What I set out to say was this. Not only
must we give more attention te this traffic,
which is one of the elements and factors
designed to stimulate the circulation of
wealth, but more and more as the years pass
on we must give attention to other things
designed to achieve the same great end. I
know that among those listening to me there
will be some who by nature shrink, as I do
myself, from the consequence of this reasoning. We bave all been taught in the past
tîat saving and thrift are cardinal virtues.
They were perhaps among the primary virtues.
But that day has gone by, and now that
many parts of the world have passed the limit
of those necessities without which man cannot live and thrive, the importance of saving
and thrift is by no means as great as it was
in other times.
As I am in complete and enthusiastic sympathy with the general object which the honourable senator from Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Dennis) and the Committee have in mind,
I support the motion. I know the honourable senator will expect me-as will this
House, if it passes the motion-to see if it
is not possible to get some practical results
within a short space of time. In this regard
I can make no promise except that which
is inherent in the fact that I unreservedly

MAY 23, 1934
approvo the honourable senator's purpose, and
in my beliof that if something in the way of
practical, definito and early resuits are not
attained I shall hear very forcibly from the
honourable senator again.
Hon. Mr. LACA.SSE: Honourablo members, I sbould like to mention just one aspect
of the situation so ably covered by the right
honourable leader in regard to tbe freer circulation of trafflc and money. Would hie, iu
view of the principles so eloquently defined
and developed, as applying to individuals, extend thoso principles to nations? Would hie
favour freer trade amongst nations and a
radical change in the high tariff barriers that
restriot their commercial relations to-day?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn afraid
the bonourable gentleman bas not followed
me. I did not know that I was in a field
of intellectual exploration which even adjoined the field in wbich hie now is. Stili, I
do not hesitate to answer bis question. Unquestionably I sbould be in favour of a lowering of tarifls the world over, and I beliove
such a development would without any douht
ho to the advantage of mankind.

LEACUE OF NATIONS
MOTION-DISCUSSION CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, May 22,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. McRae:
That this House is of the opinion that Canada should withdraw from membership in the
League of Nations, and that no further money
should be voted to the League.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
Honourable
gentlemen, J find in the Montreal Star of
last Saturday an article by the Right Hon.
David Lloyd George on the Disarmament
Conference. This is the introductory paragraph: It is assumed that the Disarmament
Conference will soon pass from bed to bier.
There is to be another consultation of the
doctors. Decency demands that the patient,
however hopeless his case, so long as he
continues to breathe at all, shall not be
abandoned without another effort to revive
him. Besides, there must be some kind of
death certificate.
May I say that I had not expected the
League of Nations would become so dangerously ill in my lifetime. I did not think it
would fall to my lot to do what Sir John
Simon the other day said he was not preHon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

pared to do-deliver a funeral oration on the
League. But some of my oldest colleagues
have said to me: "You have been speaking
for fifteen years against the League of Nations.
Why don't you take part in this debate?" My
friends outside also wondered at my silence.
They have asked me: "Have you at last found
out that you were wrong in opposing the
League of Nations? Are you converted in its
favour?" Consequently I feel compeHed to
deal with the subject to-day. I may tell bonourable gentlemen that I have spent several
hours going through Hansard to make sure
of not contradicting myself in whatever I
may say this afternoon.
The Right Hon. David Lloyd George, in
the article which I have quoted, comments on
Premier Mussolini's prediction that unless
something is done quickly to avert the threatened collapse of the Disarmament Conference,
the death of the League is inevitable. Mussolini sounds the alarm. And be is not an
alarmist; he is a realist.
As honourable gentlemen are aware, there
have been conferences, protocols, commissions,
pacts-everything conceivable has been donc
-to bring about disarmament, but it is no
nearer accomplishment. When Sir Robert
Borden went to Geneva after an absence of
ton ycars lie spoke his mind very frankly. He
said that the League of Nations stood at the
bar of public opinion by reason of having
accomplished nothing towards disarmament.
Every country from the Ural Mountains to
the Atlantic is arming, instead of disarming
as provided in the Covenant of the League
of Nations and the treaty. Indeed it is well
known that, with one exception, all the nations of the world are increasing their armaments.
The Covenant of the League of Nations
and the treaty are virtually one; both are
signed by the same signatories. No one can
deny this fact. I point it out because Sir
John Simon says the members of the League
never signed a treaty guarantceing to respect
and preserve the integrity of China or any
other country. I shall be able to prove to
you in a few minutes by these very documents
that they agreed not only to preserve, but to
maintain-if you read the French version you
will find the word maintenir-the integrity of
any member of the League attacked by an
aggressor; and nobody denies that China is
attacked to-day.
It is quite apparent that the nations of the
world are spending enormous sums of money
on armaments. They are doing it ostentatiously. Armament manufacturers are more
prosperous to-day than they have been at
any time since the Great War, notwith-

MAY 29, 1934
standing the fact that for fourteen yeara we
have had the League of Nations, every member of which agreed to respect scrupulously
the Treaty of Peace. 1 have it here, honourable gentlemen, and you can sce how
worn this copy is from frequent reading. I
dlaim it bias been broken not only by Germany, but by nearly every great nation in
the League, espeoially of late years. 1 omit
the amali nations because their armaments
do not count for much.
The only nation that hias not increased its
armament is Britain. She has actually not
built up to the limit allowed hier under the
treaty. But the other day the Right Hon.
Stanley Bald.win said in the House of Commons that England would not be inferior to
any nation in the matter of air defences. Re
also said that London could be destroyed in
twenty-four heure, a statement which is not
in agreement with the contention of the hionourable gentleman from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Black) that air armaments are nlot very
Stanley Baldwin, acting Prime
dangerous.
Minister of England, but in reality the Prime
Minister, is to my mind one of the finest
men living. He actually renouniced the glory
of the Prime Ministership in favour of Ramsay MacDonald, who has very few followers
in the House-not many more than Lloyd
George. We know at whose request the great
Conservative party in England acoepted Ramsay MacDonald as Prime Minister. It was a
wise move at the time. The elections were
carried triumphantly, the Labour party's
numbers being greatly diminished and the
Liberal representation se small-only members of Lloyd George's own family-that they
could comfortably ride in a two-seated Ford
car. I do not say this in disparagement of
Lloyd George, for I have great admiration
for bis ability. However, England to-day is
increasing its air forces, and is building more
ships.
Russia, of course, was not a member of
the League of Nations, and therefore was
under no obligation to refrain from increasing
her armament. Russia bas amuch better armay
to-day than she had in 1914, -and at that time,
altbougb most people do not realize it, she
manned a front longer than the French front,
the Italian, or the Austrian. Tbe Russian
front extended from, the Baltic to the Black
Sea, a distance of 1,300 miles, and if Russia
had not been -betrayed the story of the War

know tbat Russia was betrayed by money
from Germany, and we know by whom.

407

I am flot a judge of armies and armaments,
s0 my views àn this regard may not be worth
very much; but with your kind permission
I intend te give you what other people say
about the situation. During the Great War
we talked of .Russia as a steam roller that was
going to run right over the Austrians and the
Germans. To-day that great power lias wings.
According to the information I have, and it
is in agreement with this letter published iast
Saturday and signed by Lloyd George hiniself, Russia has the finest air force cf any
country on earth. She also lias bier oWn railway system for .military purposes. When
Russia wus beaten by Japan, more than twenty-five years ago, she was beaten because ber
only railway was a single-track une over six
thousand miles long and she could not transport men and munitions and supplies fast
enough. If she had bad a proper railway at
that time Japan might not bave captured
Port Artbur or taken possession of Korea.
So far as the United States is eonce.rned, I
will not waste time in telling this bonourable
House what is being done. We aIl know of
the millions that bave been voted to incresse
the fleet and the air forces. Honourable gentlemen know just as well as 1 do, or perbaps
better, wbat is happening there.
So f ar es Js*pan is -concerned, we also know
what she is doing. She is increasing bier army
at a rapid rate, for sbe bias an ambition to
build a b¶g oriental empire. But I do not
know that we British people should find fault
with bier. Around 1858 we commenced to
build an empire in India, and it was only
about a couple od decades later that Lord
Beaconsfleld proclaimaed Queen Victoria Empress of India, and she was then the head of
the greatest oriental country in the world. go
perhaps we 9hould not be critical of Japan's
empire-building amition. Japan has got
Manchukuo. She bias placed the son cd the
fermer Empresa of China on tbe tbrone, and
lias organized the country so we.ll that thousands upon thousands of Chinese have gone
there te live in peace. Law and order prevail
there.
Now it is said that Japan is going to take
aniother bite out of China, even south of
the great Chinese Wall. But even though
that he part of her plan, we should be the
last to fi!nd fault, for she. is only following
our example. I am not relying on tny own
opinion alone i this maLter, for I have fiere
the words of one who asks why England
should eritieize Japan for trying to build up
a big empire in the East, when England

blundered and plundered through India from
one end to the other. As every honourable
member knows, it was in the fifties that the
Indian Muti-ny took place, at a time when
British troops werc staticmed in India simply
for the purpose of safeguarding and protecýting the agents of the East India Company.
A hundred yeýars earlier, i11 1750, France
owned a very great part of India.
The
French representative there, Dupleix, married
an Indian princess, dressed like an Indian
prince or rajah, and held- court. The ship6
of France were doingý a wonderful trad-e, and
they outnumbered English sh.ips by three or
four to one. But there was in the employ
of the East India Company a young clerk
named Clive, who later became Lord Clive.
H1e schemed to get the country undeýr British
control, flot by attacking the French, but
by the method divide et impera. H1e wen.t a
long distance away to, another part *of the
country, where -he began to conquer the
Indians and make allies of them. Within
a few years the French were driven out of
India, beiog left only a few acres here and
there, to which the French cannot get acceas
except throuzh British territory.
When Dupleix returned to France he
received the condemnation of his coun.trymen. But Clive on coming back to England
was made a member of the House of Lords.
His statue cari be seen to-day on Downing
street, not far fromn No. 10.
W.hen the present Viceroy went te India,
that country was in a very precarious state.
We ail were anxious about that, greatest of
British Dominions, which according to the
last census has a population of 353 millions.
Lord Willingdon possessed a thorough, knowledge of the Oriental and Asiatie mentality
and knew how to deal with those people.
H1e neyer had a, conference with those who
were opposed to the British. The minute you
ask for a conference witi ýOrientals or Asiatics,
or even with Huns, they think that is a sign
of weakness on your part. because they would
not discuss anything with you if bhey Jiad the
power to, make you do what they want. WeIl,
Lord Willingdon knew bow to deal with those
people and I should not be surprised if
within a few years there were a statue
erected to him nearby the one of Lord Clive.
When the history of modemn India comes to
be written, I believe it will be shown t>hat our
former Governor General has played a wonderful part there.
It is said that there wou-ld not be another

British fleet should be equal to any two other
of the best fleets in the world. But as
Germany continued to build ships the twopower standard went by the board, and 'by
1912 or 1913 Germany was building at such a
rate that it ýlooked as if before long she
wou.ld have a navy even superior to that of
England.
We ail reýmember how, through
Sir Ernest Cassel, an English knight whose
mother wvas a German, the Kaiser triod to
get Winston Churchill to go over to Berlin
and talk matters over with him. But Churchill
was too sîy a fox and could net be caught.
The Kaiser angled for others, whoýse names 1
forget now, aod finalily it was decided that
Lord Haldane, who had heen Secretary for
War, should proceed with his brother to
Germany. The Kaiser was planning to build
three warships that year, and when Lord
Haldane and bis brother had a conferenýce
with him the one concession he would make
was a promise te huild ooly twe ships. On
reiceiving this report the English Cabinet said
that wvas no conce.ssion at ýaIl, hecause Cermany
ceuld not huild more than two shiýps in the
year in any eveot.
Conversations were
renewed, anme diplomatic action was taken,
andI the Kaiser was agnin aýpproaýched with a
view te getting bis cosent that. the German
navy should flot ho increaseid. But ho said,
"Befere we can have any discussion you must
repudiate Lord Haldane.? Naturally it was
difficurît for the British Government te repudiate one of its own ministers, nnd we were
very near war at, tha-t time.
The murder of the ýCrown Prince of Austria
in 1914 was seized uýpen by Austria and
Germany as an excuse for beginning the last
war. Some years before that a French
reporter on the staff of a big Parisian paper
happened to be dining with some officers on
board a German ship, and the officers drank
a toast to "der tag." The reporter asked the.m
what that meant, and they said they were
drinking te, the -day when the German fleet
would engage the British fleet in battie. Se
war was imminent a long time before it broke
eut. Lord Roberts for yeýars warned the
British people. And there was some ground
for the fear that England might have te stand
alone in flghting Germaoy, for one Prime
Minister of France, Caillaux, said the beat
course fer France was te be friendly with
Germany.
H1e argued that German armies
could march across Belgian territery into
France, just as in fact they did during the
war. Many people believe that war might
have been avo>ided if Sir Edward Grey had

MAY 29, 1934
flot waited until mobilization had proceeded
so far in Austria, Russia, Gerrnany and France,
before announcing that England would fight
to maintain the neutrality of Belgiu.m. We ail
remember bow, wben the British Ambassador
at Berlin stated that England would upbold
the sanctity of the treaty for neutrality,
Bethmann-Hollweg scoffed at that treaty as
a "scrap oîf paper." Gerrnany was not expeeting that war would corne so suddenly. The
Kaiser was away on a cruise near Norway, in
bis private yacht. However, 1 admire Sir
Ed~Ward Grey for waiting so long as he did,
until the flsh wus well on tbe hook and could
nlot get off. H1e ressoned that war with
Gerrnany was inevitable, an*d that no better
tirne than 1914 could be chosen, because
France was ready. I think he should be given
great credit *for arranging tbat England did not
have to figbt Germany single-banded.
In cornron witb rnany other people, I do
not beliieve that war is imminent, because at
the present time German-y has fia moncy and
I arn sure she bas no credit. 0f course those
facts are not necessarily guarantees of peace.
Mter the French Revolution, which commenced in 1789 and lasted for several years,
Napoleon had not rnucb roney, but he
marcbed bis armies aIl over Europe and won
wonderfua victories. H1e went down to Italy
and drove tbe Austrians out of tbat country,
and still he did not bave a very big war
chest.
Almost fifteen years ago, in October, 1919,
we were discussing in this Chamber the proposed ratification of the Treaty of Peace. I
was one of those who said at the time that
when England had signed a treaty it was
applicable ta the whole British Empire, and
therefore it was not necessary for us ta signify
our ratification in that instance. Strange ta
say, 1 was supported on that occasion by the
honourable gentleman who now leads this
side of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Here is what he said:
We have assumed international obligations
without obtaining in return an international
recognition. We shail neyer be represented in
the Council of the League.
He was too modest, as it turned out. As
Canada's representative he was later elected ta
the Council of the League. That was a much
greater bonour than the other wbich. feIl ta
bis lot, tbe presidency of the Assembly, which
involves nothing more than presiding over the
general meetings beld at Geneva every year.
The office lasts for one year only. But it
was a matter of great political importance for
Canada ta be on the Council, for that is the
body that controls ail the actions of the

4UIU

League. No matter on wbich the Council is
unanimous is submitted to the Assembly;
the only questions referred to it are those
over which there is a difference of opinion.
Every year, a few days before the Assembly
meets, the Council prepares a neat littie
agenda for the Assembly, in order to give the
delegates something to talk about and to help
them put in the time. That amuses the delegates for the tbree or four weeks that they
are at Geneva, where they have a good time,
as we ail know.
I amn sorry the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chs4pais) bas left the
Chamber, because I was going to talk to
bim. But I will talk about him just the same.
H1e made a short speech, and a very eloquent
one, as he always does. Article 10, he said,
"is the foundation of the League," and "imposes an obligation on the states signing that
historical deed." I will not weary the House
by reading that article, because we ail know it.
But I want to refer to one word in it. The
article says the members of the League undertake to respect and "preserve" the territorial
integrity of member nations, but Sir John
Simon denied a few days ago that Great
Britain was pledged to "preserve" the integrîty of China.
The honourable gentleman from Grandville
warned against economic pressure on Japan,
because it might lead to war. H1e went on to
picture wbat a terrible thîng war is, and then
he declared, "A l'impossible nul n'est tenu'no one can be beld to do the impossible. I
was very much surprised to hear such a
doctrine from, the honourable gentleman.
Suppose a man borrowed a large sum of
rnoney from a bank, and when payrnent felI
due be said be could not pay, because he had
not the money. Would he be relieved of the
debt? I did nlot tbink that anyone with sa
logical a mind as the honourable gentleman
from Grandville bas would argue a thing likt
that.
The honourable senator f rom Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) prooeeded somewhat
along the same lines. I have great respect
for the bonourable member from Montarville.
He is a very able man. I believe be is sinoere
in thinking tbaît the League of Nations hae
served a useful purpose. But many persons
do noît share his opinion. During the fifteen
years ithat I have been maicing speeches
against the League I have been told time and
again outside this House, "You are rigbt." I
have beg;rd people in the streets of Montreai
a.nd in some of our best clubs describe the
League of Nations as a joke. I heard this
sentiment expressed while at lunch at the

410

SENATE

Rideau Club this very day. I inquired, "Why
don't you say openly what you have just been
exprassing?" But everybody is afraid to do
sa. It is a strange thing that few persons
have the courage to express for publication
their views on great questions of public
interest. It may be expensive to declare your
mind. You may make enemies. Yau may
not get preferment; you may not become a
P. C. like some of our friends. But it is a
great satisfaction to speak frankly.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I come now to the
Lonourable and gallant gentleman from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae). He astonishes me.
Certainly he did nat speak as a belligerent
when he said: "We will nat go to war. Not
a drop of Canadian blood shall be spilled on
the battle-field." I thought I heard you, Mr.
Speaker, and Bourassa and LaVergne in the
good old days say something along those lines,
but in somewhat more emphatic vein. At that
time you and they were not going ta have the
blood of French Canadians spilled in the
Chinese Sea. I could never understand why
the Chinese Sea was seleoted as the arena of
war. They made us shudder with their horrible picture of the entrails of our sons hanging from the yards of British battle-ships. It
was an unimportant detail to them that
modern battle-ships have no yards. But that
fantastie prediction was accepted and the
Nationalists gained twenty-seven seats in the
province of Quebec.
The honourable gentleman from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Chapa.is) asserted that notwithstanding its failures the great amphietyonic
Council of Geneva had effected a great deal
of good. He cited the work it had accomplished in dealing with social questions, such
as the opium and the white slave traffic;
headth, including the spread of epidemics, the
affect of economic depression on public health,
malaria, leprosy, venereal disease, and tuberculosis. This is al] very fine, but I do not
think the League of Nations was created to
cure-shall I say?-venereal disease.
The
bonourable member from Hamilton (Hon. Mr.
Lynch-Staunton) is net in his seat. He always
seems to strike the nail on the head. I agree
with him heartily that the primary object of
the founding of the League was to establish
peace in the world.
The honourable member from Parkdale
(fon. Mr. Murdock) in the course of a twohour speech made the rather striking statement that our per capita expenditure on the
League amounted to a mere three-cent postage
stamp-a statement that he repeated several
times. Perhaps it would not appeal ta the
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

crowd so well to say that the Hon. Mr.
Rhodes, to make good this contribution, has
to provide out of taxes $1,000 for every working day in the year as our contribution to the
League. Or the honourable gentleman from
Parkdale might have said that the total
population of the world is estimated at two
billions, of whom one-half support the League,
and that their per capita contribution would
be equivalent to only a one-cent postage
stamp. Our per capita contribution is three
times too much, aecording to the honourable
gentleman's argument.
The honourable gentleman also referred ta
the good offices of the League in settling the
dispute between Sweden and Finland regarding the sovereignty of the Aland Islands. As
honourable members are aware, these three
rocky islands ara in the Baltic Sea, at the
entrance of the -Gulf of Bothnia, and have a
population of about 3,000. Nobody cares
wery much who exercises sovereignty over
them. Ultimately the islands were awarded
to Sweden.
At the time the League of Nations was first
suggested, I was inclined to favour the proposal, but I remember Sir Wilfrid Laurier
saying ta me: "My dear Casgrain, it is a
beautiful dream. As long as there are people
on earth there will be war on earth."
But a League of Nations ta preserve peace
is no new thing. When it was proposed at
Geneva the delegate from China stated that
1,200 years before the birth of Christ they
had a League of Nations among the various
peoples or tribes then controlling the territories which later were welded into what
became known as China. Coming down to
mediaeval times, Hugo Grotius, the greatest jurist in the Europe of his day, wrote
a book, De Jure Belli et Pacis-right in war
and peace. This he published in 1625. He
was a native of Holland, then the leading
nation in Europe.
Her navy was second
to none, and she was drawing immense
revenues from Java and Sumatra.
Grotius
proposed that all the great powers should
contribute towards a world navy and army
to preserve peace. In the lifetime of Grotius,
1583 to 1645, the great Dutch school of
painters wrought their masterpieces, and
scholars from all parts of Europe flocked
to the world-famed universities of Holland.
L'Abbé de Saint Pierre followed 'Grotius
and in 1738 published his welI-known work
on an international league to preserve the
peace of the world. His views are contained
in sixteen volumes, all of which are on the
shelves of our Parliamentary Library. I hold
in m y hand a synopsis of those books. Nothing came of his proposal. The late Right

and offered ten times the salary they are
getting now. In anot.her country, to the
Bouthi, the Administration is using the services of a number of professors. Well, we
shall see the outcome of their learned cooperation.
The honourable senator from Montarville
in the course of his edoquent contribution to
this debate put this question to us: If you
do away with the League of Nations, what
will you put in its place? My answer is: If
you have a publie nuisance what do you put
in its place? Nothingl
It is a striking coincidence that forty-eight
hours after the honourable gentleman from
Montarville spoke in this debate Sir John
Simon made a speech on the League of Nations, and expressed a view simàilar to that
stated by my honourable friend, that there
was no0 use in exertiflg economie pressure on1
a recalcitrant nation, because it might be considered an unfriendly aet and lead to war.
My honourable -colleague ought to be very
much pleased to have his opinion endorsed
within forty-eight hours by a great lawyer
like Sir John Simon.
But Sir John went a ilittle further, and this
is where I take issue with him. He cannot
make me believe that Vwo plus two make
three. He said that England was pledged to
respect, flot Vo preserve, Chinese integrity.
Referenee to article 10 of the Covenant shows
in the English version the word "preserve,"
and in the French version the stronger word
"cmaintenir." Still Sir John says England
signed no0 treaty with China. That is the
way he explains the position as a good lawyer.
As I say, we are told that to impose economic pressure would mean the risk of. war.
Naturally it would. That is what I have
fifteen
to the world. He, however, is more practical been saying in this House for the pastmember
than mont professors, for he supplements the years. I agree with the -honourable
family 'budget by writing humorous stories. from Grandville and the honourable member

such as Schwab, Rockefeller, Ford and others, to controvert that statement.

Hon. Charles Doherty Vold me that l'Abbé
de Saint Pierre submitted ibis great work to
a Cardinal at the French. Court with a
roquest that he read it and give him his
opinion of the proposai. When six wesks
laVer the Abbé returned, the Cardinal told
him: "Your work is perfect. I could not
take one word from it, nor add one word,
but it was writýten for angels, noV for men."
The Cardinal pointed out to the learned Abbé
that riglit could prevail only if those who
sought to uphold it could exert a might
greater than the might of the wrongdoer.
A third proposal for an era of perpetual
peace among the nations of the world was
made by Kant in 1797, but it, Voo, was given
a very cold reception.
The honourable senator from Montarville
(lion. Mr. Beaubien) quoted Dr. Nicholas
Murray Butler as saying, "Public opinion
holds the world in its hand." I would qualify
the statement by adding: Yes, when there are
no0 guns. Many persons Vhink that Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler talks Voo freiquently
out of his turn, when he is not invited to
express bis views. As the principal of Columbia he can lay down the law Vo bis university. If he wants Vo influence the course of
evýents in the United States, why does he not
run for the House of Representatives or the
Senate? Then he would be in a position to
speak for his electors, not for Dr. Nicholas
Murray Butler abuse. His naine appears
in Vhs press nearly as often as Bernard
Shaw's. But Bernard Shaw bas a purpose i

very audacious for a land surveyor to get up
here and contradict these erninent legal lights.
What 1 say must be taken for what it is
worth, no more; but I have a right to express
what I believo to be true, oven if I arn hauled
over the coals for it. Sir John Simon also
says:
Britain stands by the Lytton report on
Manchtiria (the League of Nations Commission
which condornod Japanese aggression).
Sho stands by that, but she stands away from
it. She will neot take the censequences unloss
the United States cornes inte the League of
Nations. The United States would not ýcorne
in before, and she is not going te corne in
now, whon there is trouible. If the tJnited
States would co-eperate there would be no
more of the borrors of war.
Britain stands by ýthe Washington NinePower Treaty, whose signatorios agreed to
respect the intogrity of China, and she stands
by the obligations shie assorned under the
Leagne Covenant.
The League of Nations Coenrant was te preserve and maintain the integrity of any mcmber of the League of Nations.
H1e observod, howovor, that under the NinoPowor Troaty Britain had net undertaken te
use lier navy. army or air force te preserve
that indopendence.
Well, now. that is net in keeping with article
10 of the League of iNations:
In speaking of article 10 there is one thing
eut sav xwheii the honourable member
irom Grandville (lien. Mr. Cihapais) was here.
If I arn permitted, I shall go back te it. I
iappen te bc familiar with the amendment te
3rticle 10. Sir Lomer Gouin was a great man,
tnd a friend of mine. 11e went te the
Assernbly of the League of Nations and proposed an ameodýment with su-eh sincority that
hie ýcenvinced others, and bais resolution was
sent on te a cemrnittee. It was hoped that
it would have a nice funoral. and that nothing
more would ever be heard of it. But that was
net what bappened. Sir Lomer Gouin went
te thie committee and insisted on a13
decision.
11e pleaded 'bis case before the committee witb
the same earnestness witb which lie had presented it te the Assembly, and it was adopted
by the cornmittee. Thon there was only one
tbing te be donc by those who had the power.
That seerned dcad easy. The resolutien required unanirnous support. Lo and bebold,
the representative of the Shah cf Persia
opposed it. We know very well who was paying bis expenses. Naturally, bis objection at
once put an end te the matter. And now
tbey try to drag in, the resolution.
The
honourable senator frcm Grandville, with a
vcry specieus argument, said it was ail right.

rdid

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

It was as if wc wanted te adjourn and one
member objected, and we said we would
ad.journ anyway.
When Sir Lomer Gouin came back hie was
a disappointed man. H1e said t-hat he would
net return te the League; that everytbîng was
fixed beferehand. It is like the races. The
Assembly has very Iittlc te do with the
League; the whele show is run by the Council,
especially by the Secretary. Sir Erie Drurnrnond, one cf the cleverest mon England could
pick up, was the only person named fer that
position, which would seema te be a very
humble one; but hie ran everything.
The treaty was made by three men. Al
that Canada's representatives knew cf it was
what they read in Le Petit Parisien, wbich
they could buy for cne cent. They wore nlot
allowed inside the door of the roomn wbere
negotiations werc goîng on. You will notice
that arnong the high centracting parties te
the treaty nearîr' every country is named but
Canada. We werc brought in by the side
door, 1 suppose. Thore is the treaty; there
are the narnes. I defy anybody te find
mention cf Canada, Australia, New Zealand
or South Africa.
Inside were President Woodrow Wilson,
Georges Clernenceau, and David Lloyd George.
Woodrow Wilson wanted a League cf Nations. H1e had been a college professer and
the principal cf a university, and waq dictatorial; furtbermore, bais healtb was sucb that
hoe was irritable and would net stand being
contradicted. lis secrctary, Tumulty, said
hoe ias se excited ho could net be spoken te.
The man was wern eut. In bis "Napoleon:
The La.st Phase," Roseberry says that at
forty-five Napoleon was worn eut. Wilson
was sixty years cf age, and had rue two presidential elections, and won thern-enough te
wear eut rnost mon. Besides, personal matters
aIse contributed te bis weakness.
Clemenceau, wbo was Prime Minister cf
France, was net very keen about the League
cf Nations. He said: "My, rny The President of the United States wants fourteen
points. That is a lot. God Almigbty wanted
only ten cornmandrnents."
But the little Welshrnan, Lloyd George, was
thore. As you know, the Welsb people are
srnart for trade. You rnay be surprised te
learn that a large part of the trade in London
is donc by Welsb people, and that the greatest
stores there are run and controlled by thern.
The Wolsbman said: "France doesn't want
this; Japan and Italy do net want it; I arn
going in for it." England had got rid cf the
German fleet, but there was another thore in

MAY 29, 1934
ber side-the German colonies. Lloyd George
realized the situation, and arranged everytbing
ini a nice, quiet way. He bad a clause inserted
in the treaty stating tbat tbe self-governing:
colonies and dominions could also came inta
the Ieague. There is where we came in. That
gave England six votes; and, besides, tbe
Secretary ran everytbing.
Then tbe French people said ta Clemenceau:
"Wbere do we corne in? Here is Sir Erie
Drumrnond running everytbing, and bere is
England with six votes. It does flot look
very well." Then the Labour Bureau was invented, and France, being strongly Socialist,
chose Albert Tbomas, a bigbly educated man
and a notorious Socialist, as director of that
Bureau. T-hen it was decided that tbe Labour
Bureau sbould get forty cents out of every
dollar that came in. I have before me the
budget of the League for 1934.
The Labour Bureau afld tbe SecretaniatGeneral neyer bad any communication witb
each other. Albert Thomnas would neyer agree
with Sir Erie Drummond, and ail the work
was duplicated. I am not saying wbo was
wrong. I rnay say an passant tbat this book
whicb I have in my band tells ahl about the
salaries paid, and it would appear tbat tbis
one is getting tao mucb, and tbat one toa
littIe. There are too rnany gencrals and not
enougb soldiers, and we know an army of
generals is of no use.
Now, bere is a despatch fram Gyeneva:
World powers join in great race for arme.
Alarining signe that the much feared armament
race is in full swing the world over are seen
by statesmen in recent develapments in the
capitale of practically every major power.
From the nerve centres of the world came
reports that the nations are buckling on their
armour; that every branch of armament-air,
water and land-is being strengthened.
Gerrnany was opposed ta the Treaty of
Versailles, and re-armed. The United States
naval and air forces are being increased. In
Italy, in tbe Speech from tbe Tbrone,
Mussolini put into tbe moutb of the King the
statement tbat it would be necessary ta discard ail obsolete armernents and replace tbem
with tbe rnost modern ones. He returned ta
tbe old rnaxim, Si vis pacern, .para bellum-if
you would be safe, yau must be strang, and
then people will besitate, to attack you.
I arn told by the bonourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MoMeans) tbat tbat
is enlarged upon in the New Yark Timnes.
France is building forts, tbe like of wbiah
tbe world bas neyer seen, aIl along tbe
German frantier. and 1 believe she is financing
Belgium in tbe building of forts on ber
frontier.

Germany bas increased her army budget
to $358,000,000, and her
from 3268,000,00
aviation budget frorn $28,000,000 ta $84,000,000,
and she bas appropriated 3100,000,000 for
Nazi storm. troops.
Poland, which had an arrny of 2&3,000 men,
now bas 341,000.
Russia bas increased her armies in the past
two years frorn 562,000 ta 678,000 men.
Japan bas increased her forces by 100,000 ta
a total of 456,000 in three years.
At Singapore, where the Indian Ocean and
the Pacifie Ocean meet, the British are carrying on operations. They are just cornpleting
the biggest graving docks ever buit. Singapore
is a strategîc point, and, like Gibraltar on the
Mediterranean, occupies a comrnanding position. I think England was very wise in what
she did, because if one of her ships were disabied in those waters she would have to go
thousands of miles to Malta. llowever, what
Engiand bas done is not in accordance with
the treaty. And do not forget, Mr. Baldwin
has said that the air defences of Britain must
be equai ta the very best.
Italy bas increased. ber air and naval forces
by 43,000. Japan had 450 planes; she now
has 3,324. France bas 4,760.
Germany-and this is the worst of ali-is
building up with rnoney whicb bas been
borrowed from tbe United States since the
War, and wbich probabiy will neyer be repaid. Altbougb Germany bas the greatest
iran and steel manufacturers in the world, and
the moat up-ta-date factories, she is actually
buying aeroplanes ta-day, wbile ber own men
are idle and there are raw materials right in
the country. One Englisb firm. alone got an
order for 180 large bombing acroplanes. WË~y
would Germany buy outside of tbe country
instead of using ber own materials and labour?
It is beyond me to tell. It seems ta me
highiy significant that wben the Germans have
sucb efficient factories tbey sbould be buying
aeroplanes in England. It also appears tbat
tbey buy acroplanes in Sweden and Spain.
Tbey muet be in a great burry ta prepare for
something.
Then Poland is building forts an the Russian
front, and Czechoslovakia is doing the same
tbing an the German border.
Did tbe League of Nations prevent armament? I leave it ta anyone ta answer.
I was told by two persans wbom I consider
ta be among rny very best friends that I
sbould not make fun of the League af Nations--tbat I sbould nat treat 1?his question
with levity. Camille Houde says you sbauld
neyer foliow the advi-ce of yaur opaonent.
But listen ta wbat was said by tbe Rigbt

SENATE

Hon. Robert Cecil, who is now the Viscount
Cecil of Chelwood. He is a descendant of the
great houses of Cecil, Burleigh and Balfour,
and cornes from a family that has given statesmen to Britain from the time of Queen Elizabeth. He is very quaint, to those who know
him. I think the careless way in which he
dresses is an affectation designed to attract
notice to himself. As Chairman of the Empire
Parliamentary Association I went to the station to meet him on one occasion, and when
I saw the hat he had on and the way he was
dressed I could not believe he was the man
I was looking for. However, I was assured
that he was; so I brought him along in my
motor car. Throughout the ride he was busy
opening telegrams and had no time to talk
to me, and I did not talk to him. Over at
Geneva he stood up, tall and towering over
everybody, and asked that the articles be
read, and after the reading he spoke these
simple words: "If the treaties are not observed, Europe no longer exists." Well, everybody knows they have not been observed, but
Europe still exists. When he uttered those
few words t'he ladies waved their handkerchiefs, and cheers followed cheers, but no one
knew better than Lord Robert Cecil himself
that the treaties were not being observed.
Let me read article 227:
The Allied and Assoeiated Powers publicly
arraign William Il of Hohenzollern, formerly
German Eniperor, for a supreme offence against
international morality and the sanctity of
treaties.
A special tribunal will be constituted to try
the accused, thereby assuring him the guarantees essential to the right of defence. It will
be composed of five judges, one appointed by
each of the following Powers: namely the
United States of America, Great Britain,
France, Italy and Japan.
In its decision the tribunal will be guided
by the highest motives of international policy,
with a view to vind'icating the solemn obligations of international undertakings and the
validity of international morality. It will be
its duty to fix the punishment which it considers should be imposed.
The Allied and Associated Powers will
address a request to the Government of the
Netherlands for the surrender to them of the
ex-Emperor in order that he may be put on
trial.
Willl any friend of the League of Nations
tell me that there ever was a request to the
Netherlands to deliver up the person of William II? I do not think there was. The
treaty was broken there, yet a solemn pact in
the Covenant says it must be scrupulously
observed.
The Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, whose country is now called Yugoslavia, made an invasion
into Albania. At once Sir Eric Drummond,
Secretary-General of the League, telegraphed
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

them that if they proceeded with invasion
they would be at war with every nation which
signed the Covenant. Well, they went ahead,
but not very far. Albania is a little onehorse country of only a few square miles.
In area it is about the size of Vermont or
New Hampshire, and it has a population of
about one million, like Montreal. Rather than
get into a state of war with all the nations,
the invaders turned around and went home.
The principal fact that caused them to reach
this decision was that Albania is Italy's landing place on the eastern side of the Adriatic,
and Mussolini would have been after them
if they had persisted in staying there. But
the League takes great comfort out of settling
that affair.
I have in my hand a newspaper clipping
of an Associated Press cable from London,
dated May 4, which is an illustration of some
of the things on which the League of Nations
spends considerable time. The article is
headed: "Britain annoyed by Liberia's acts.
Mandate being discussed as solution of stand
toward League." The first thing the League
did in Liberia was to take up the question
of slavery, but they did not stop the traffic,
for it is still going on. Liberia is a negro
republic, which is bounded on the west by
Sierra Leone and on the east by thie French
Ivory Coast. The capital is Monrovia, which
has a population of about 10,000. The country has a total area of 45,000 square miles,
measuring seventy-five miles in widtlh in one
part and about 150 miles in another, the
inhabited sections being practically all along
the coast, and the rest nothing but African
jungle. There are from one and a half to
two million people in the whole country. The
President is Edwin Barclay. an American.
I-t may be interesting to note that the
Liberian republic was originally a kind of
negro settlement. In 1822 some emancipated
negroes left America, where they had made a
little money, and went te settle in Liberia,
and in 1847 the country was proclaimed as
an independent republic, the constitution
being modelled on tbat of the United States.
It is one of the members of the League of
Nations. No white man has a vote there, but
the country must contain something worth
while, for England is annoyed, and it would
not bother to take that attitude if the whole
place were worth nothing.
The President of the republic, Edwin Barclay, 'controls the customs and finances. John
Loomis is one of the directors of the place.
Harvey Firestone, the big American tire
manufacturer, leased one million acres of
land in Liberia-this may be what has annoyed England-and in 1929 he planted

MAY 29, 1934
30,000 acres with rubber trees, which 'had been
brought from Sumatra, 12,000 miles away.
He has 10,000 Liberians working under the
direction of 90 white men. There are
100,000 blacks in the country who are partly
ci-Vilized. ]t was fromn that country that the
Jesuits imported slaves into America, because
in those days, when slavery was legfitimate, it
was believed that in the tropics white people
could flot resist the beat sufficiently to do
a.ny work.
Three years ago the League of Nations
appointed a commission, on whicb was Dr.
Oharles 8. Johnson, another American, to
inquire into some conditions in Liberia. The
League is constantly appointing Americans to
do ail sorts of things, although the United
States is not a member. There. was the
Dawes Plan, which fell down, and after that
there was the Young Plan. The last big conference was at Lausanne, wben Germany gave
notice that at the expiration -of the moratorium

she would be unable to pay her debt;

indeed, if shc -hacl the money she would not
psy it. As a result of the representa:tions
of the delegate f.rom the United States the
cther nations were led to believe that aIl the
debts would be forgiven. Tbey were agreeable to that proposition only 'because they

bas spent a lot of money on plans for financia! and social assistance to Liberia, but that
country bas refýused to aocept thm. And
now it appears that England wants Liberia
expelled from the League.
And we all remember the Corfu incident.
General Telilini and four others, members of
an engineering unit apparently similar to our
Royal Engineers, were marking the frontier
hetwcen Albania and Greece, and were killed.
It is admitted that posts bad been removed.
Under artiole 16 it was clear thst Mussolini,
if he attacked Gree-ce, would be putting Italy
at war with fifty other nations that belong to
the League, but he did not hesitate on that
account. The Italien fleet bombarded Corfu,
killing some men and more chidren, and the
people there hoisted the white flag of surrender. As soon as Sir Eric Druirmond heard
of the bomibardment he went as fast as he

In an article in the North American Review
of November, 1023, Stephen Lauzanne gives
an account of an interview with Mussolini.
There is no doubt that the interview is faithfully reported, because the writer would know
that if he distorted the facts (he would not
get another interview in that quarter.

1

A telegram came in, and Mussolini said, "Bene,
molto benel" He tossed the message over
to Lauzanne. It announced that Corfu had
surrendered. A few minutes later another
telegramn came in, and Muasolini turned very
pale, and exclaimed: «E terribile, tercribilel E
un giornata nera!" Lauzanne thought that a
catastrophe had happe-ned. It was the news
that four aviators had beenkilled in a crash.
And Mussolini cried like a chilid.
Lauzanne said to Mussolini that England
would not be pleased at the attack on Greece.
Mussolini was ready with an answer. Re
pointed out that in 1850 a Portuguese Jew,
Don Pacifico, owned in Athens a store which
was looted during a riot. He asked damages
of 800,000 drachmae-then worth about
eighteen cents each-and took his case to the
Greek courts, where he loat. Claiming that
he was a British subjeet, he appealed to England, and Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister, immediately ordered Admirai Parker to
proceed with a fleet to Piraeus. Two hundred
ships in the iharbour of Athens were seized.
Mussolini asked, "If England could seize two
hundred ships for damages of 800,000 drachmae, how many islands can we take for
50,000,000 lire?"
The Huse of Lords thought that Admira!
Parker proceeded in a very high-handed way,
and they were not very much in faveur of
bis action. But in a four-hour speech in the
bouse of Comjmons Lord Palmerston defendcd
bis course. He pointed out that the Jew had
appealed to England as a British subject. In
the olden days, he said, if a man necded protection anywhere in the world he necded only
to say, "Civis Romanus sum." And Palmerston declared he wanted it undcrstood that a
man was saf e anywhere if be could trutbfully
say «Civis Britannicus sum"ý-"I arn a British
subj ect."
With regard to the incident at Corfu, the
Congress of Amba-ssadors met and arranged
to give Mussolini 50,000,000 lire; otherwise
they feared he would withdraw Italy from the
League. The ultimatum sent by Italy to
'Greece required the most solemn publie
apology, a ceremony of expiation in Athens
Cathedral and a high mass for the repose of
the souls of the siain Italian General and the
four Italian engineers, and a salute to the
Italian flag. Mussolini was ashamned to takée
the money; so hie resurrected the Order of the
Xnights of Malta, to whomn he handed the
50,000,000 lire, with instructions to go to Corfu
and make good whatever damage had been
done by the bombardment.
The League failed to settle the Vilna
trouble. His Excellency Paul Hymans, the
great Belgian statesman, was appointed sole

416

SELNATE

commissioner. He gave three decisions and
each was turned down by the countries concerned.
The settlement of the Upper Silesia boundary dispute cannot be credited to the League
of Nations. Stephen Lauzanne states that
France was chiefly instrumental in persuading
the parties to accept arbitration. He adds
that the Supreme Court of the United States
or the Pope could have given a decision that
would have been equally acceptable.
In 1921 and 1922 war was raging in AsiaMinor between the Greeks and the Turks.
We all remember the Chanak incident. Lloyd
George was Prime Minister at the time. I
suppose, like most Prime Ministers, he desired to remain in office, and presumably it
was worth a little war to ensure his tenure of
power. He cabled to our then Prime Minister, the Right Hon. Mackenzie King, and
asked if Canada would join in the projected
war with Turkey. Mr. King requested to be
informed of the reason for the impending
hostilities. The right honourable gentleman
who now leads this House did not hesitate
on that memorable occasion; he answered,
"Ready, aye readyl" There was an election
in progress in Bagot county-no, that was later
on, when the right honourable gentleman
made his speech in Hamilton and proposed
that there should be a referendum before this
country entered into another war. I may
say that yesterday I was told by a very
prominent man of the Conservative party that
after the right honourable gentleman explained his Hamilton speech before the great
Conservative Convention at Winnipeg be
would have been elected leader had the vote
been taken at the close of his address.
In an interview on the 14th of this month
Mussolini stated to Hector Bywater, of the
Daily Telegraph, that the League of Nations was dying. He expressed himself in
favour of reforming the League, but added
that if disarmament was net effected the
League would no longer have any right to
exist. I consider Mussolini one of the greatest
Latin geniuses since Napoleon, and when be
goes out of his way to make a pronouncement
such as I have just cited, one may presume
that he is pretty well convinced be is right.
Now, honourable members, I desire to quote
the Toronto Star. It says that England will
fight for trade, but not for a moral principle.
Well, a moral principle depends on various
persons' opinions. The great Napoleon said
that the English people were a nation of shopkeepers. We know that those shop-keepers
gave him a good deal of worry-in fact they
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

worried him to death. After all, trade is the
life-blood of a nation, and is worth fighting
for.
The British Empire to-day has a population
of no less than 485,000,000, occupying pretty
nearly one-quarter of the total surface of the
world. The total land surface of our globe
is 574 million square miles. The British
Empire covers about 14 million square
miles. At the end of the War Great Britain
was given a mandate over the former GermanAfrican colony of Tanganyika, comprising
336,000 square miles. She divided Togoland
with France, another German-African possessien. This of course left the Germans without
any colonies. When the War was ended and
the Treaty of Versailles signed England had
rid herself of the Cerman naval menace and
received the German colonies in Africa. As
might be expected, these colonies are being
well administered. Certainly Great Britain
came out of the War with increased prestigeat which we all rejoice.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the few remarks I have to
make may as well be injected into the debate
now, because, first, I think they can be readily
compressed within the interval before adjournment, and, secondly, it seems to me that at
as early a date as may be suited to the convenience of honourable members this debate
should be brought to a close.
This is not said by way of reflection on the
wisdom of the introduction of this discussion,
for it is well that we should give attention,
and fairly continuous attention, to the great
problem involved in the resolution. Much
less is it said in derogation of the excellent
presentation of the question made by the
honourable senaftor from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae). His speech-in which, I must
say in opening, I can find very little to agree
with-was a compendium of information and
a complete criticism of the conduct of the
League of Nations during the short period of
its life, and of the attitude of various nations
towards it, as well as a warning of what be
conceives to be the dangers of our inclusion
in its membership.
I want to say very emphatically that if I
thought there was any very serious or general
sentiment in this country adverse to our
continuing as a member of the League, I
should feel disappointed indeed. This is true
despite the faet that there are many discouragements incident to the history of that
great institution; also that there are weaknesses in its present organization, and good
reasons for oriticism of the attitude in times

MAY 29, 1934
past of prominent members of the League,
which has resulted in its failure at crucial

junctures.

In determining whether or not Canada
should continue to adhere to the League we
must have regard, I think, to considerations
deeper than all these things. We must
endeavour to look very far ahead and take
careful cognizance of our position before we
take so serious a step as to indicate that
we are thinking of turning our faces away.
We have to decide what would be the consequences of such a decision on the part of
this Dominion.
My thought turns immediately to the con£equences within the British Empire itself.
As complained by the honourable senator
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) in
his very interesting address, we may not be
counted among the high contracting parties.
For myself, I do not care very much about
the altitude of our contracting status: we
are serious contracting parties. And we are
members of the League as a Dominion of
this Empire. It would seem to me of disastrous significance that this country should
seek to lead the march of that Empire out
of the ranks of the League. Certainly I could
be no party to such action being taken without the fullest consultation with all other
members of the British Commonwealth, without every effort being exhausted to see that
that Commonwealth does fully its part to
enable the League to function.
We all understand its purposes. It is well
for us to measure and see whether or not
those purposes have to be abandoned because
of certain failures which have marked the
course of the Council and Assembly over a
period of years. The great mission of the
League is to form a barricade against the
recurrence of war in either hemisphere. Of
course we all know as well some collateral
purposes. It is the only institution to which
any nation has the right to look for reforms
which must have universal concurrence in
order to effect results. Consequently the
League addresses itself to the tasks of
restricting opium traffi--a world problemof controlling epidemics, of limiting and if
possible eliminating the white slave traffic,
and to other high and worthy objectives.
We all admit that these have to be more
or less subsidiary to its great purpose. We
never can feel satisfied if it does not ultimately achieve the object of its creation,
but merely stops the spread of opium traffic
between continents or reduces the white slave
evil. Yet it does not follow that these
objectives are not worth achieving, that we
have not to measure what the League does

along these lines before we hastily turn our
backs upon it. We all agree that much has
been done in these collateral spheres.
I want to examine for a moment how far
the League gives promise of reaching real
results in contracting the possibilities of war.
That it has been able at various periods to
prevent minor conflicts we have to concede.
I fancy there have been perhaps four, five or
six occasions when this world, organization
has been utilized successfully in bringing to
settlement conflicts that might have extended
and become very serious. That the intervention of the League has been useful, not in
spheres of a major character, but nevertheless
in important spheres, in limiting loss of life
and the curse of war on this globe, is
undoubted. But even there, of course, it has
not as yet given promise that it can fulfil
the real and larger mission for which it was
created: that mission was to prevent the
recurrence of such a calamity as the world
suffered in the tremendous conflict which
terminated in 1918.
The magnitude and imperious character of
the cause for which the League exists, I hope
we all appreciate. I listened with great interest to the scholarly address of the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black). I must say that I cannot estimate
as he does the nature of war at this time, or
the importance of striking war from the
calendar of world events. The honourable
senator seems to think that as the mechanism
of war improves, the mechanism of defence
marches with it side by side, and that in
consequence war, instead of becoming more
and more dangerous, more and more fatal,
becomes really, so far as those participating
in it are concerned, more and more merciful.
He gave percentages of fatalities in the
Battle of Waterloo, the Battle of Agincourt
and other battles in the history of Britain
and France, to show that of the numbers
participating in those conflicts a greater
proportion suffered death than in even the
larger engagements of the Great War.
This may be true, but it is only one phase
of the picture. When we look at the whole
drama, war now assumes a portentousness
that cannot possibly be compared with anything in history. In the last struggle there
were not just a few hundred thousand taking
part, as -in the Napoleonic Wars, or a few
tens of thousands, as in the wars of the
Tudors or the early wars with France, but
numbers running into tens of millions. Indeed, in that conflict, which lasted only a little
more than four years, ten million fell and
certainly not less than twenty-five million or

colossal and unending battle from the
Declaration to the Armistice.
But, because of the nature of the struggle,
its tragedy did not end there. All soldiers
underwent a trial, an ordeal, from which
many of them through the whole course of
life can never escape. The nerve-wracking
endurances left their mark on all but a few
of those who survived. As the war progressed it became more and more an affair of
the civilian as well as of the Tommy and
the Jack Tar. Engines of destruction invaded
homes of civilians, and were about to do
so on a far vaster scale. In considerable
degree it was this fact which finally brought
about a cessation of hostilities. The pressure
that ultimately broke the heart of Germany
was the pressure of the British fleet, which
refused to let supplies pass to civilians of
that country. This pressure was applied by

severity has again been multiplied in posse
since by the progress of science, until today it is impossible to conceive what would
be the consequences of a world struggle which
lasted for more than a few weeks.
The last war brought many surprises. None
of the specifie predictions were verified by
the events. We are as prone to minimize the
consequences of the next struggle as we were
of the last.
I know there are differences of opinion.
There are those who feel that these deathdealing mechanisms cannot be produced in
sufficient quantity and on a sufficient seale
to be a serious menace to the great proportion of mankind. But I cannot underthe

leaders of our country, like Stanley Baldwin
and Butler, like all those who survived in the
sphere of high statesmanship the struggle of
1918, are not far wrong when they tell us
that if civilization does not wholly disappear
after another conflict, at least there is no
hope of anything of the character of our
present social structure surviving for an hour.
Consequently the greatness of the League's

in these fourteen years it has achieved or
given great promise of achieving that purpose
is, I am free to admit, uncertain. I am free
to admit that there is much room for criticism, perhaps for discouragement; but there
is no room for despair.
The withdrawal or threatened withdrawal
of two great nations is indeed a serious blow.
Germany came into the League six years
ago. She has now given notice of retirement
for reasons which to the world outside do

have on the ground that equality has been
denied her can be addressed to the League
of Nations, for within the framework of
that institution she has had full equality.
But the time certainly cannot be far distant
when Germany will look to the League for
the realization of some advantage. The other
side of the shield is certain to appear, and
Germany will probably find some reason to
return to the fold of that institution for the
betterment of her own position.
The conduct of Japan is, I fear, universally criticized as well. Japan claims to bave
kept within the provisions of the Covenant;
at all events she says, " If I have net, I
am prepared to leave." But how she can
believe she 'has kept within the provisions
of the major articles of the Covenant I am
at a loss to understand. Undoubtedly the
appeal of China was made under that special
article out of which there does not grow the
imperative application of the sanctions called
for by other articles. Whether it was by
reason of pressure on the part of greater
powers that China made ber appeal under the
article which did not call for sanctions, I
do not know. At all events there was unquestionably no disposition on the part of
the greater powers to take the risk of applying sanctions for the objective to be served
in the case of the Manchurian conflict.
This brings to my mind the thought which,
more than any other, I wish to impress upon
the House at this time. I will put Great
Britain, France and Italy all in the same
category in this regard. They did not see fit
to apply economic and financial sanctions
called -for by article 16 of the Covenant.
They knew, as we all must know if we
study the penalizing terms of that article,
that such action must have led to war, and
war on a grand scale, unless Japan receded.

there is not one of those nations but would
feel ashamed if it were found guilty of
conduct which it could not justify. This onus
which is thus thrown upon the aggressor is
in itself of enormous value. Therefore the
world is likely to benefit more from the
League than it ever did from the old system
which sought to balance the strength of one
group 'of powers against the weight of
another. Surely it is more like to succeed
than any other institution which mankind bas
been able to devise. My hope is in the longer
view.
I entirely agree with the honourable senator
opposite that a stunning blow was struck
when the United States refused to join the
League. I am one of those who hold a conviction that the decision of the American
Republic to disregard the pleas of its great
President and to withhold its allegiance was
probably the most deplorable verdict ever
given in the history of the world. This great

dictated in considerable degree its terms.
The personality of the man drove through,
against tremendous obstacles, many of the
features of the covenants. After he had donc
all this while he was understood to speak on
behalf of the great nation he represented,
strong opposition developed at home, the
lessons of the conflict were forgotten, the
peril of the future and the interdependence
of nations were all cast behind, and the
United States quietly withdrew, contending
that these covenants were not theirs and they
could take no responsibility. At the close of
a war from which they had been determined
te escape, in which for three years they
declined to participate, the course of which
showed that no country could remain neutral
without completely forgetting or submerging
every principle of honour, a war which
proved that another on the same scale would
make neutrality impossible for any length of
time, and which showed that the worli had
become a unit and the interests of all nations
were intertwined, how they could feel that
the peace and welfare of that unit did not
concern themselves passes the comprehension
of thoughtful people in all other countries.
But such was their decision, and from the
consequences of that decision we have net
been far removed in the whole course of these

to take things as they are. I believed that if

signify their eagerness to join a League of
Nations. Should there be another struggle,
in which perhaps they would be participants
for the whole period rather than for onethird of it, there would likely be at its end
no reluctance on the part of the United
States in joining the other powers, in realizing that nations arc as brothers, and in doing
their part to prevent the occurrence of still
another world calamity. Believing that, and
knowing that there is at least some value in
the League as it now stands, in its reduced
and one might even say its emaciated form,
and confidently hoping that with the passage
of time and the experience that cornes with
time those nations who have retired from the
circle of the League will return, and those
who have net yet entered will see its usefulness and become members, I feel that we cannet do better than stand by to the last,
remaining faithful and steadily doing our full
part in support of the organization. Let us
by our example illustrate what the League
can become, net only by contributing to its
upkeep, but also, if it becomes necessary to
do so in order that the collective will of all
the nations within its fold may prevail, by
standing ready even to draw the sword on
behalf of that collective will.
The whole question is whether the future
is te belong to reason and wisdom or because
of some sluggish, poisonous obstinacy in
human nature to be given over to profligacy,
lunacy and ruin. For myself I hope for and
believe in the brighter destiny, as I am sure
does everyone in this House. We believe
that sooner or later there will corne a time
when a League of Nations will be the
arbiter of the world. Man learns from experience. Often it seems he can learn
only through suffering, but somehow or other
lie always learns in the end. And he will
learn in this sphere of international relations.
Before he fully applies the lesson there may
be an interval, and it may be a tragic interval
of perversity, of destruction, of human immolation, but if we take the long view we
can see that the future will be under warmer
and brighter skies. The time is coming when
there will be universal allegiance to the
League as the only possible fortification which
can stand between man and international
anarchy. Let us hope that time will soon
arrive. Let us hope that the allegiance which

MAY 29, 1934
ultirnately ail nations will give will bc
accorded under the sunshine of reason and in
the hour of triumphant peace, and that these
pledges of fidelity will flot wait to be spoken
in the black perdition which follows an overwhelming catastrophe, by the gasping hreath
of a condernned and striken generation.
The time is coming when peoples will rejoice in the measure of their devotion, when
they will be glad that througb dark and discouraging years their countries stood true and
neyer wavered. The time is coming when
even on this continent the dragic drama of
1920 will be reviewed and redeemed, when the
name of Woodrow Wilson will corne back into
its own, when it wiIl be written large across
the pages of history, above the names of men
who made nations and saved them, because
it wilI be recognized that he at least tried
even unto death to do sornething greater still.
The tirne is coming when bis name will shine
respiendent over this hemisphere, flot because
of the triumphs which from time to time
crowvned bis if e, but because of the momentous mission, the glorious endeavour, in which
in bis laqt crowded and toiling days he failed.
For us the journey may be long and
arduous. But I hope that at its end it will
be possible to say of Canada that tbroughout
its wbole weary lengtb we kept the faith.

CONSIDERATION 0F COMMITTEE
AMENDMENTS

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH moved concurrence in the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
to Bill E, an Act respecting Shipping.

421

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
May I ask the
right honourable the leader of the House a
question? Here is a Bill that came to us
in February last, since wbich time it bas been
before the Committee on Banking and Commerce. 1 understand froma hearsay that many
amendments have been made to the Bill, and
that those amendments are wbat we are now
asked to adopt. I rnay say that I-and I
believe this is true also of other members of
the Senate, with the exception of those who
sat on the Banking and Commerce Committee-have not the sligbtest idea what the
arnendrnents are. Does not the right honourable gentleman think, in view of the complirnentary references that have been made to
the Senate as a working body, we sbould have
before us the text of those arnendments
before we are asked to adopt them? If I
arn in order I would respectfully insist that
we sbould have the Bill, with the incorporated
amendments, before us, so that we could logically, carefully and properly consider tbem.
This applies to tbe Shipping Bill and also
to the Courts of Admiralty Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Bill, is it not?

This is a public

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then it should go
to Committee of the Whole.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen, I certainly bave no objection to
any procedure the Senate may desire to
follow in regard to this measure, but I think
a statement in reference to it, most of which
would be applicable also to the Courts of
Adrniralty Bill, may be of value.
Nothing in the way of legislation introduced since Confederation bears any analogy
at ail to the present Shipping Bill. Possibly
the Criminal Code, in the scope of its legislative sweep, and the utter lack of precedent
before those who had to draf t the law, would
be the nearest approach to this measure.
This Bih bhas been deemed necessary because
of the Statute of Westminster. Unless we
choose, as I understand two other Dominions
have done, to regard the Statute of Westminster, for the present at least, as noneffective in respect of shipping-a closed book,
a dead letter-such a measure as this is
essential. Having accepted the Statute of
Westminster, we f elt it to be our duty to
buihd into our law a shipping statute. This
invohved problems which had neyer been before Parhiament. Some of them were problemns of principhe, but hargeiy they were problemns of immense detail, gigantic in number

422

SEN'"ATE

and magnitude, and necessitating work, of a
very technical and definite character.
This Bill, it will be remembered, was introduced into the Senate last year as a Gaverament measure. It went ta the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, and after many
weeks. I think I couid say months, of study
on the part of that committee the Bill became
water-iogged and had ta be abandoned for
the sc'ssion. The reasan was, as I t'hink I have
aiready intimated, the fear that if it %vas
passed in any form we couid at that time
design we might find in certain instances and
on certain occasions that aur ships,' saiiing the
seas of the worid, and supposed ta came under
the law of another Dominion, were under no
law at ail. Therefore we feit we had better
keep our ships, as in the past, under the Merchant Shipping Act of Engiand, until such
time as we could mure thoroughiy wurk out
the probiem.
This session a new Bill was introduced. It
was prepared under the supervision of the
officers of the Department of Marine, and in
consultation with the govecnments of other
cauintries, particuiarly the British Dominions,
with a view ta, making certain, if possible,
that we shouid not step into an unknown gap
and find ourseives in a state of coilapse. This
Bill was referred by the House ta the Coinmittee on Banking and Commerce. That
committee aiready had a heavy load of legislation before it in the Insurance Bill, the
Admiraty~ Biii and some other measures of
less consequence. Then the step was takenanc rareirv taken, in my expecîencr' at leastof appainting a subcommittee wvhich wouid
give v ictuaiy its whole time to this Diii. That
subcommittee consisted af-I shall name nat
ail the mcmbers. but mo4t of them-Senator
Grieshach. the chairman, Senator Brown, Senater Tanner, Senator Graham and Senator
Coté. They took the Bili as their own speciai
charge. They sat througbout the Easter holidavs and for some time aftcr, and did not
observe union hours of labour. They were
assisted by Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Anderson,
the last mentianed gentleman being lent by
the Department of 'justice. In consequence
of the labours of the committee it was deemed
wise ta have the Bili reprinted. The amendments cansisted of the excision of no iess
than forty sections, the introduction of between one hundred and ten and one hundred
and twenty sections, and other changes far
exceeding one hundred in number." The Diil
as amended was hardiv recagnizable as the
one that went to the subcommittee. To have
thrawn it ino this Hause, or the Banking
and Commerce Caxnmittee, with this mass of
amendm.ents attached, wouid oniy have caused
R.ght Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN.

confusion; sa the subcommittee got authority
fromn the Committee ou Banking and Comnmerce ta reprint the Biii. It contains, I think,
samne nine hundred pages; so fromn a financiai
standpaint the reprinting wvas no light undertaking. It was feit, however. that this %vas
the oniy adequate way of deaiing with it.
The Bili came back ta the generai committtee in the repcinted form. and that coimmittee proceedcd ta hear representations from
shipping associations, pilotage associations,
labour associations and shipping interests, ail
in addition, of course, ta the many who appeared before the cammittee a year aga. At
the conclusion of this review, everyone being
hieard who desired ta be heard, the reprinted
Biii was again amended in same particulars
which were important, and in same flot so
important. Every portion of the Biii as ta
which any representatian lias been made pro
or con was thoroughly reviewed by the gencrai committee, and the proposed legisiation
lias now been submitted ta this House.
Now hionourabie members wish that it go
before the Committee of the Whole. There
certainiy wouid be no objection on the part
of the Government, nar of anyane, but if
this House is te, study the measure with anything like the thoraughness of the select coinmittee, we shall be working on it just as long
as the committee was; and unless we do study
it with that thoroughness, I see littie use in
referring it ta Committee of the Whoie. We
cao examine a bill camprising a few pages,
like most of the measures that came before us
from time ta time, but I doubt that in the
present instance we could do work of any
special value in addition to that which the
select cammittee bas aiready done.
There would be fia use in committing the
aid bill with the amendments. This may as
well be considered a new bill. It is a mass of
details having ta, do with problems that arise
in shipping. I do flot know that it contains
anytbing which couid be caiied a matter of
policy.
If in the face of the statement I have made
the House desires ta resoive itself into Cammittee ta consider the measure, there is certainiy no objection ta that course. Dut, as I
bave said, nothing is ta be gained by a perfunctory examination, and if every honourable member is ta make himself as familiar
with the various sections as are the members
of the select committee, we shahl need ta
spend as much time and labour on it as that
committee did.

MAY 30, 1934
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Oan the right honourable gentleman tell us about how long it took
the general committee to revise the amended
bill? 1 understand it took approximately two
weeks or more.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: About twenty-six sessions.
Rîght Bon. Mr. MÉIGHEN: I cannot say
j ust how many sessions, but there were not
twenty-six. Several meetings were held, and
they lasted for several hours, and ended on
the evenîng of the 24th of May.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The commrittee sat
much longer, perhaps, than the Senate would
care to sit?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I think
so. We are ail ready to go into Committee,
if that is the wish of the Bouse, and there
ccrtainly is no reason why I should shrink
from this course. But I want the Senate to
understand what it would mean. In order to
do work of any value we should have to go
over the whole long j ourney, taking each step
with the same care that was taken in the
Banking Committee, and having the same
detailed explanations. I had rather thought
the Bouse would be disposed to accept the
verdict of that committee in this matter.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGRIEN: I should not
anticipate that the Bill would go before a
special committee of the Bouse of Commons
and run the gauntiet there as it has done
here. But should my view prove wrong, the
sessional indemnity certainly would not be
too large.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: It is my good or
bad fortune to be a member of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, which
bas had the duty of studying our shipping
legislation and making any amendmcnts
thought necessary. At its sittings for the
consideration of this measure the committec
was at flrst presided over by the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black),
who was very efficient in his office. Be was
succeeded by the honourable senator from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), who likewise was vcry efficient. Credit must also be
given to the right honourable leader of the
Bouse (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), who was
present at ail the sittings and devoted a
great deal of time and study to the measure.
The same may be said about the honourable
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

423

Bon. Mr. PARENT: As members of the
cornmittee we ail think we have done the
best we could, and it seems to me nothing
would be gained by imposing upon ail honourable members of *this Chamber the arduous duties that we have been performing at
numerous sittings, extending over at least a
month and a half.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I understood the
right honourable leader of the Bouse to say
that the Bill had been reprinted.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Bon. Mr. MURDrOCK: May we get a
copy of it?
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGBEN: Bas not the
reprinted Bill been distributed?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The copy that I
have on my file is dated the 27th of February.
Right Blon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have just
been told that the reprinted Bill is ready
for distribution and copies of it are piled up
at the door. I think every honourable member should have a copy.
Bon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is ail I arn
asking for.
Right Bon. Mr. MEICHEN: I thought
it had been distributed. The honourable
membcr's request is certainly reasonable.
Members of the Bouse should have access
to the Bill; it should be before them, so
that they may have an opportunity of going
through it, and if it contains anything which
appears to be worthy of inquiry or to necessitate a change they would be quite in order
in asking about it. As I say, the honourable
member's request is reasonable, and I therefore tbink the motion should flot be proceeded
with to-day.
I have just heen advised that the reprinted
Bill does flot contain the amendments made
by the standing committee upon the report of
the subcommittee: it is the Bull as reported
by the subcommittee. The amendments made
by the committee will be available to-morrow;
s0 honourable members will have everything
before them then.
I should not have sat down hefore without
paying trihute to the fidelity and competence
of the subcommittee. I think I have neyer
seen a better piece of work done hy any
committee of this Bouse than the work which
the subcommittee did on this measure.
It is my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
understanding that the amendments made hy

after the report of the subcommittee had been
received, could flot be reprînted until adopted

SENATE

by this Chamber, because some rejections or
modifications might be made here, and in
that event we should require to have those
included in the measure when sent to the
House of Commons.
I regularly followed the work of the whole
committee on this important and intricate
piece of legislation. As the right honourable
gentleman bas explained, we decided to leave
it to a subcommittee. When it was reported
back to us we were highly pleased with the
result of the obviously diligent and serious
work that had been devoted to it. The
reprinted Bill, containing the subcommittee's amendments, was distributed among
interested parties in Canada, and we thon
listened to a number of additional representations and procceded to make some further
amendments. It is my opinion that honourable members who have not given some study
to the Bill will hardly be able to arrive
at a very clear understanding of the proposed amendments between now and tomorrow.
I do not think any committee
elsewhere could deal with the many technical
clauses of this Bill within five or six weeks.
It seems to me it would be well for the
House of Commons, at this stage of the session
to accept the Bill in the form in which it
leaves the Senate, always rcserving, of course,
the right to challenge any principle.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: For the information
of honourable senators who are not members
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, I may point out that the Bill
which is now being distributed is the
amended form of the original Bill. Accompanying this amended Bill is a printed concordance which gives a complote record of
every change that the subcommittee of the
standing committee made in the original Bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is the Order

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is a rule of the
Senate that public bills should be dealt with,
not by a standing committee, much less by
a subcommittee of that standing committee,
but by Committee of the Whole. Sittings
of the Senate have been cut short in order
that measures which should be considered by
this House might be dealt with by standing
committees. For the last few years it has
been the practice to refer important public
bills to a standing or a special committee.
In some cases, as in this, a subcommittee has
actually dealt with the Bill. This is contrary
to the rules of the Senate-and I have been
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

a member for thirty-four years. Surely anyone interested in a bill originating in this
House can find an honourable senator who
will submit to us the necessary information
on the measure.
Hon.
Mr. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
members may be interested to hear something
of the actual work involved in the consideration of this Bill, for it indicates what would
lie before Committee of the Whole were it
to undertake to discuss the measure clause by
clause.
As has been pointed out, we had before us
last session Bill J. This session it came
before us as Bill E, consisting of 822 clauses,
together with some 150 pages of schedules.
The subcommittee reduced the Bill from 822
to 719 clauses by the following proe-ss: 16
new clauses were added; 40 clause, were
dropped or superseded as superflous: 51 subclauses were added; 58 clauses were rewritten;
279 clauses were amended; 186 clauses xwere
relocated; the schedules to the Bill were in
one case cntirely changed. Thon the main
committee, finishing its labours a few daYs
ago, made 42 principal and numerous minor
amendments.
The principal amendments
occupy three and a half pages; there are in
addition amendments occupying several typewritten pages.
To discuss the Bill in Committee of the
Whole clause by clause would take quite as
long as the time which the Standing Conmittee on Banking and Commerce lias already
devoted to its consideration. The honourable
gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) a few days ago spoke of that which
is possible and that which is impossible. I
venture to assert that it would be almost
impossible at this time for the Committee of
the Whole to give thorough consideration to
this Bill clause by clause. However desirable
it might be, I do not sec how it could
possibly be donc.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is a rule of
the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member thinks that public bills should
not be referred to standing committees?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Exactly.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, it is
not a rule elsewhere. The Commons referred
the Marketing Bill and the revision of the
Bank Act to standing committees. Does any
honourable member suggest that in . Committee of the Whole we can go into the
details of a cumbersome, voluminous measure
like this and revise it on the wholesale scale
which the honourable chairman of the sub-

MAY 30, 1934
committee indicated a moment ago? Every
honourable member knows that it cannot be
done. The honourable member from De
Lanaudière says, " Let us go through the Bill
in the House." . If we do so the Senate will
be charged, as we have been charging the
Commons ever since Confederation, with holding up measures until the end of the session;
either that or we must be content with a
perfunctory, farcical review of the Bill. We
can take our choice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Although I am
out of order in speaking a second time, may
I add that in stating the House of Commons
would perhaps be well advised to accept the
form of the Bill as it comes from the Senate,
I desired simply to draw attention to the
fact that towards the close of nearly every
session since 1867 the House of Commons
has placed this Chamber in the very sarne
situation by leaving it no time to make
changes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have but one suggestion to make. It seems to me there is
some basis for the position taken by my
honourable friends from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) and Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock). This Bill comes before us mainly,
one might say, from a subcommittee. The
majority of the members of this House have
had no opportunity to consider the measure
at all. I never saw it until this morning.
Those who are not members of the Banking
and Commerce Committee have not read the
Bill, and I presume at this stage they are
not likely to do so. As for the Committee
of the Whole dealing with the Bill clause by
clause, I think it would be foolish to make
the attempt. But the pilotage interests, the
labour organizations and others are interested
in certain provisions of the Bill, and we might
very well consider the measure in Committee
of the Whole in order to give ample opportunity to honourable members to discuss contentious points. In this way we should hear
the arguments pro and con and be in a
position to vote intelligently.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: It will take a long
time to go through the Bill clause by clause
in Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am not suggesting
that the Bill be considered clause by clause.
I think we could deal with contentious points
in a comparatively short time.
The motion stands.

COURTS OF ADMIRALTY BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH moved concurrence in the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to
Bill C, an Act respecting Courts of Admiralty.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would not the discussion we have had on the Shipping Bill

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would to

as ponderous as the Shipping Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Has the Bill been

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It has been
reprinted twice. This Bill has relation to
jurisprudence in admiralty, not to the actual
duties of ship owners and the like.
If honourable members desire, we can defer
consideration of the measure, but I hope the
House will keep in mind that we do not want
to have either this or the Shipping Bill
delayed in reaching the Commons. They are
Senate bills, and certainly they involve the
greatest labour by far of any legislation that
has come before us this session; in fact, in
the case of the Shipping bill, any legislation
since Confederation. We do not want to be
open to the charge that we are sending these
bills over to the other Chamber at a stage
of the session when there will be little time
to give them proper consideration.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have no objection
to the Bill being proceeded with now.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable members, I understand this measure provides for
the retirement of judges in Admiralty Courts
on their reaching seventy-five years of age.
It is well known to every honourable member
and to many outside that some men at
seventy-five years of age are just as capable
as are other men at sixty-five. If a retiring
age is decided upon, seventy-five might be a
satisfactory limit.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Is the honourable
gentleman referring to the Senate now?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No, I am not trying
to be facetious. In some of the provinces
there is very little work for the Admiralty
Courts. If some of the judges, having
reached the age limit, are retired, although
well able to perform their duties, and the
vacancies so created are filled, the public expenditure will be increased without any cor-

contentions asserted with reforenco to it in
another place. The only purpose of this Bill
is to organize the translation service of this
country. It is not a Bill to deny such service
where necessary or wanted. Apparently there
have been ninety-one translators scattered
throughout the whole service, translating
French into English and English into French,
having each a duty to perform, but being in
no way related to one anothor. The consequence was that in various departments
there was nobody to do translation work
Transîstors were

attached to the House of Gommons, the
Sonate, or some department, or else were not
attached at aIl, but at large,, and not answerable to the caîî of the minister or deputy
who had work to ho done. The resuit was
that new transIstors had to be engaged and
new moneys oxpended. Although we had
transistors, no ono knew in just What locality
they were, and they were flot availablo and
not doing very ranch.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: And very often doing
very badly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And doing
badly. This was because of the absence of
answerabihity.
À further result of this disorganized state
of the translation service was that the French
version -of important documents which, to be
of any value at sîl, shoul'd 13, published as

427

soon as possible after the English edition,
were coming out six or eight months later.
The transistors were taking their time, and
plenty of it, the consequence being that the
money spent in producing these translations
was simply wasted.
The cost of the ninety-one translators,
flot including the cost of the printing, typing
or other clerical assistance, was about $252,000.
The purpose of this measure is to organize
the work so that there will be a -head, a
deputy, or someone who will be answerable
to thoso in authority for seeing that the
work of translation is done properly. 0f
course, so far as appointments are concerned
-and I do not think it is anticipated that
there will ho any-the Civil Service Commission will act in its usual capa-city. The
Bill is introduced not for the purpose of
skimming translation, but with the object of
securing translations, good translations, and
giving the country value for the money that
is being spent.
Hon ourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able members of the Sonate, I confess that
I do not know very much about the operations of the various departmente in regard
to translation. My experience has to do more
particularly with the translation of the
debates of the Sonate. I must admit that
in the past we have encountered some difficulty in obtaining within a short time the
French translation of speeches mnade in
English, or the English translation of speeches
made in French. Very often the translation
bas been ready for distribution onîy after the
close of the session.
There are, however, a few things that 1
should like to know ini regard to wbat is
involved in the change. There is a much
larger staff of transistors in the Commons
than in the Senate, -and I have not had
opportunity to inform myseif as to the rapidity with which they do their work. I suppose
that our Hansard transIstors wiil be mergod
with those of the Commons, and that during
the session thore will be «aspecial staff attending to the translation of the debates of
both Houses. I should like to know if the
work will be improved or will be performed
with greater .rapidity by that staff; and in
order to know that I should have to be
informed as to what happens in the House of
Commons. Aro the membera of that House
able to get a translation of the Unrevised
Edition of Hansard within twenty-four or
forty-oight hours?
I should like to k-now also whether my
right honourable friend intends to have this
Bill sent to -a standing committee of the
House or deait with in Committee of the
Whole.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
W/ould flic lionourable gentleman put thiat into the Brll'

MAY 30, 1934
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Of course. What
are we here for if not to make a good Bill?
It would not cost the country a cent more
to divide the translators into sections so that
the work of the Department of Railways and
Canals would go to this group, and the work
of the Department of Marine and Fisheries
to that.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You would run
out of translators.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There are very few
people who know how to translate even the
word "lighthouse," and that is a very simple
matter.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Phare.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, that is not it at
all. Honourable gentlemen know that when
one is around twenty his mind is very receptive. For instance, I was required to
translate the description of a Palliser gun into
French. A Palliser gun such as the Mackenzie
Government bought was not a smooth-bore
gin, for which the French expression is un
canon à âme lisse, and I had to spend a long
time in studying a glossary in search of the
exact words. Because of the many technical
parts that were referred to, I suppose my
translation was a poor one. The gun was of
a new type, a rifle that gave a twist to the
projectile.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
It was not a
smooth-bore gun?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No. And there was
no word in French for it. I am trying only
to convince the House that if we provide in
this Bill that translators with certain qualifications be allocated to certain classes of work,
we may expect to get good translations.
Ninety-five per cent of the translation is from
English into French. The simplest kind of
work is on the debates. Anyone can translate
them, because when men are making speeches
in Parliament they seldom use technical
language. And after all it does not matter
very much how that work is done.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: The honourable gentleman should confine his remarks to his own
speeches.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But the statutes,
and documents in the Publie Works Department, the Marine Department, and many
other branches of the service, require a command of a technical vocabulary. And where
will you get men to translate some of the
reports on scientific research? So many new
things are always coming out that the translators would have to be constantly studying

429

not only dictionaries, but glossaries as well,
in order to familiarize themselves with the
latest terms and expressions. I feel keenly on
this matter, as I suppose it is only natural
that I should, since I spent three years of my
life doing translations. In the old days we
were paid off at the end of each session. I
may tell honourable members that when there
was a change of government I was saved the
expense of coming back here, for I was
informed that my services were no longer
required.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
in the absence of the Chairman of the Special
Committee on Public Accounts, I may
be
able to throw a little light on this subject.
The Secretary of State, Hon. Mr. Cahan,
appeared before our committee some two
weeks ago and explained this Bill in detail.
He produced a number of exhibits showing the
inefficiency of translators, and I am sure it
would be difficult to imagine anything more
inefficient than some of the work that we
were told about. So poor are some of the
translations that they have to be rewritten
many times, and the consequent expenditure
runs into many thousands of dollars.
As the right honourable leader of the House
said, it is expected that a considerable saving
will result through a distribution of the work
that will keep the translating staff
busy
throughout the year. Mr. Cahan estimated
the possible saving from a centralizing of the
translations, and from the better arrangements that could be made for printing,
at
$200,000 a year. I think that consideration
in itself should outweigh the objections that
some honourable senators seem to have. Mr.
Cahan stated definitely that the establishment of a bureau would result in the French
edition of our Hansard appearing as promptly
as that of the Commons Hansard now does,
which, if my memory serves me correctly, is
within about twenty-four hours of the English
edition. So it seems to me that this Bill is
designed to accomplish things that we have
in mind. Some one department would necessarily have to be held responsible for the
bureau, and I feel sure we could look for
efficient administration and translations under
the direction of the Secretary of State.
If honourable members examine departmental files they will see many instances of
improper translations that justify the passing
of this measure. I have no doubt that as
we proceed with the Bill we shall be given
more details along that line.
Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable senators,
I happen to be a member of the special committee to which the honourable gentleman

SENATE

430

bas just referred, and I was present when
Hon. Mr. Cahan gave his evidence. But it
would appear from what bas been going on
in other places that this Bill bas given rise
to many contradictory statements, and it bas
been contended that the translators from
English to French do not always receive that
co-operation which would enable them to do
the best work. Although the evidence of
Mr. Cahan was to the effect that the entire
fault lay with the translators, the fact would
appear to be that some officials are in the
habit of handing in documents with so many
corrections that no one in the world could
make a proper translation. That being the
case, it seems to me that instead of referring
this Bill immediately to the Committee of
the Whole we should send it to the Standing
Committee on Civil Service Administration.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: It may be that in
another place there are certain influences that
do not exist here. In any event, we could
consider the question without prejudice. If
anyone bas suggestions to make, why should
be not be given an opportunity of making
After various views had been prethem?
sented to the committee we should be in a
better position to understand the matter and
to give it impartial consideration. It would
not take very long for the committee to
hold the requisite hearings, for we are experienced in getting the points of view of
witnesses. In any event, I for one am willing
to remain here and sacrifice my whole summer
vacation, if necessary, in trying to prevent
any injustice from being donc.
The Standing Committee on Civil Service
Administration is composed of honourable
senators Bénard, Donnelly, Griesbach, L'Espérance, McRae, Prevost, Rankin, Robinson and
Cairine Wilson. I am willing to leave the
fate of the Bill in the hands of this committee, fully confident that its report would
be in all respects fair and equitable.
Hon. J. E. PREVOST (Translation): Hon.
members of the Senate, may I, with reference
to the Bill under consideration, suggest that
it would be but fair to examine thoroughly
the present system and seek the necessary
information so as to take a rational, just and
equitable attitude towards the State as well as
towards the translators. I think we should
appoint a committee where we could question
those who are better qualified to inform us,
and thus be in a position to cope fully with
the present situation.
Hon.

Mr. PARENT.

The Bill submitted to us tends to disorganize or, at least, to alter a system which
bas existed in this country for a number of
years.
Perhaps this Bill may be a remedv for
certain defioiencies or defects. It is, therefore, not a question of systematically opposing the Bill, but simply of making a well
The Committee of the
founded decision.
Whole could not obtain the requisite enlightenment; nor would it afford to the employees who were criticized and against whom
(harges were made, a fair opportunity to
vindicate themselves and fully acquaint us
with the situation. J think that, under the
circumstances, I must appeal to the spirit of
fair play and equity of the right honourable
leader of this Chamber. The Senate should
be enabled to enlighten itself further as
regards this Bill and moreover be placed in a
position, through reference to a committee, to
study this important question. The Senate
should net make an unconsidered decision.
The other Chamber had an opportunity of
thoroughly going into the subject-mattor of
this Bill, and a similar opportunity sbould be
afforded to us, in order that we may seriously
examine this measure. I think that wisdom
and caution enjoin us to refer this Bill to the
committee suggested by mv honourable friend
from Konnebec (Hon. Mr. Parent) or to some
other select committee, so as to be in a better
position. if necessary, to discover the remedy
for the situation.
Twenty-five or thirty years ago, a similar
inquiry was ordered by the Government. It
was carried out by Mr. Achille Frchette,
ar. expert translater, in the bilingual eountries
of Europe, such as Switzerland and Belgium.
Mr. Frechette, in his report to the Governnient, following his investigation abroad,
stated that they had to discontinue the
systen of centralization of official translation,
after giving it a fair trial; and since then
each of our federal departments has had its
own staff of translators. Possibly there are
weak points and deficiencies existing; however, it is doubtful whether a radical change
in the system would be the right method to
bring about the desired improvements. Once
more I state that it would be fairer to this
Chamber as well as to the translators interested that the Senate be given an opportunity
of thoroughly studying in select committee
the matter of official translations. This question involves a number of technical features.
The mechanical side of it bas been much
discussed; however, I am not aware tiat anytbing bas been said concerning its technical
character, which I think most important. We

MAY 30, 1934
must examine this question seriously, bearing in mind especially its technical character
and all the difficulties inherent to it, if we
wish to obtain in this country a system of
translation worthy of Canada's Parliament,
and as perfect as that prevailing in other
bilingual countries.
I am not opposing the principle of the Bill;
I am not expressing views absollutely contrary
to it. Only, I think, and I again state, that
it would be but fair and equitable to throw
as much light as possible on the matter in
order that we should be better informed
before reaching a decision. I therefore
request the right honourable leader of the
Senate to kindly, if possible, afford the members of this House an opportunity of better
studying this Bill in select committee.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I confess that I know very little about
this measure, except what I have read in newspaper reports. Everyone will concede the
paramount importance of translations. More
than three million people depend upon the
French version of our statutes for their law,
and it is important to them that translations
be accurate. The honourable senator from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent) has requested
that the Bill be sent to a standing committee,
before whom witnesses could be heard. I do
not know whether such witnesses might be
inclined to advise the amendment or rejection of the Bill. But it seems to me that a
measure of such importance, of vital interest
to one-third of our population, might be
treated in the same way as many public bills
and sent to a special or standing committee
for the purpose of receiving outside advice
thereon. It might be prudent to follow that
procedure. I readily admit that for a good
many years the translation system in this
House has been very poor. I am also willing
to admit that the reasons which the right
honourable leader on this side of the House
gave for the Bill are both pertinent and powerful. Obvious'y, you cannot have satisfactory
service from a large body of translators under
virtually no contral, or, at best, divided control. Still, I know how difficult it is to translate Acts of Parliament and legal documents.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It is not merely the
literal construction, it is the nice shade of
meaning that sonfetimes gives a litigant either
an adverse or a favourable judgment. All
lawyers, particularly those of the province of
Quebec, appreciate the difficulty of transiating a technical contract. How often have they
to argue on the barely discernible neaning to

431

be interpreted from the English or the French
version. The translation must be an absolute
reflection of the text in the original language.
For this reason I should be very glad to see
every possible safeguard thrown around this
proposed legislation.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I must confess that I fail to appreciate the
ditliculties that have been conjured up. I
have read most of the newspaper reports of
what occurred elsewhere in relation to the
Bill. I am quite sure no one will quarrel
with the statement of my honourable friend
on my left (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) as to the
absolute necessity of providing the very best
translation in both languages. That goes
without saying. But, as I understand, that is
not the purpose of the Bill at all. We are
not called upon to decide whether we are
to have a good or a bad translation. This
Bill has been and is being attacked on one
ground only-that it interferes with existing
conditions. The translation service is virtually without organization, and the prime
object of the Bill is to organize the service
so that it will function efficiently.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
purpose of the Bill.

That is the only

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Certainly. I am not
going to suggest that the Bill should not go
to a committee, but I can scarcely see the
necessity for this course. It has been decided
in another place that we should have a properly organized translation service under a
Minister of the Crown. For weeks and weeks
elsewhere all has been said that could be
said in favour of continuing the present
system.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: How does the honourable gentleman regard the independence
of the Senate? Would he place our staff -of
translators under a M.inister of the 'Crown?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would do away with
the staff.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would do away
with it to bring about economy and assure
efficient service. Every time any attempt
is made to reorganize and put the service
on a more efficient basis, and so save money,
there is a row, and a proper row. I know
it: I have been in those rows.
We have to decide this simple question:
whether or not we are to continue inefficiency
in this branch of the Government service. I
say, no, let us endeavour in every possible
way to improve the service.

432

SENATE

I would ask the right honourable leader
on this side of the House to take into very
serious consideration the advisability of referring the Bill to a committee, with a view to
ascertaining whether or not it is desirable
to have the service placed under a Minister
of the Crown, with a proper organization to
ensure its efficiency. Let us dispel the idea
that anyone desires a poor translation service.
I repeat, the whole purpose of the
Bill is to bring about a long overdue improvement.
Hon. JAS. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, a few years ago, when I was head of the
Department of Labour, I was also in charge
of the Printing Bureau-the only Labour
Minister, by the way, to exercise that control. In the Labour Department at that time
there were two translators, close relatives.
There was not sufficient work to keep them
occupied, but they were both retained in
their positions. I may have been mistaken,
but I was always under the impression that
one of those gentlemen had a very imperfect
command of the English language.
I had
a few friendly conversations with him, but I
do not think he could really understand me;
nor could I understand him.
W'hile in charge of the Printing Bureau I
had ample opportunities of perceiving the
extra cost of translation. I am confident
that no honourable senator would for a
single day be willing to continue the system
then in vogue; and yet, apparently, certain
distinguished and honourable gentlemen are
determined to resist any change.
This Bill will give the people of Canada
that which they are entitled to, a fair day's
work for a fair day's pay-something which,
if I know anything about the system, they
have never had heretofore. No doubt there
are dozens of good and efficient translators,
but it seems to me-pardon the expressiona piece of sentimental nonsense to continue
the present system.
While I acted as Minister of Labour I was
advised from time to time that daily as many
as 3.000 post cards and letters reached the
Printing Bureau, asking for the French translation of some public document. Frequently
no French translation would be available.
Then it would be necessary to find out from
the Department in which the document in
English originated why the translation had
not been made. This delay involved additional expense.
I recall another phase. During the parliamentary recess a considerable number of the
presumably capable and well paid civil
servants, the busy period being past, thought
Hon. M.

CALDER.

they also might take a recess; they went
away on their holidays. That was another
cause for the delay in getting translations of
public documents down to the Bureau to be
printed.
I had not expected to discuss the Bill. I
have followed the newspaper reports of the
discussion in another place, and I have no
hesitation in labelling a great deal of what
I have read as absolute nonsense, unfair to
the people of Canada. If I know anything
about Government measures, this Bill is in
the interest of economy and is fair and reasonable to all concerned. It demands from the
translators as from other classes of Government employees nothing more than a fair
day's work for a fair day's pay.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable members.
I should like to know whether the question
before the House is on the merits of the
Bill or of the present system.
I thought
we were discussing whether the Bill should
be referred to a special committee or be
considered in Committee of the Whole. If
it is decided to send the Bill to the committee suggested by my honourable friend from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent), I should not
like to forgo my right to speak to-day.
I heartily concur in the point of view
expressed by my honourable friends from
Kennebec, from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Prévost) and from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) that every means should be exhausted
to secure ample evidence with respect to the
subject-matter of the Bill. As we all know,
it provoked contention elsewhere and has
stirred up public opinion to a fervour suc
as, I think I am right in saying, we bave not
seen since the famous Beauharnois days. Of
course then there was electricity in the air;
there was more electricity than water.
French Canadian public opinion is very
much concerned with the subject matter of
the Bill. I regret honourable members do
not appear to pay much attention to the
submission of my honourable friend from
Kennebec, that there should be no encroachment on the prerogatives of the Senate to
administer its own affairs. I wish better luck
to my honourable friend from Mille Isles.
I hope that before next November our colleagues will be given an opportunity to take
cognizance of what he says.
It was my
privilege two weeks ago to take part in the
debate on the League of' Nations, and I
clearly stated my reasons for speaking in
French. I have not yet seen any translation
of my speech, although for a few weeks
now we have had a French edition of the
Senate debates-something that has been

MAY 30, 1934
given to us since this Bill becarne the issue
of the day in the other Huse. Surely this
is something more than a coincidence. But
despite the fact that the translation of the
debates of the Senate is now being taken
care of for some time-pending, I presume,
final decision by this House as to what shall
be done-rny honourable friends who do not
happen to know French, one of the officiai
languages, will, have to wait until November
or December, or maybe until Fehruary of
next year, to find out what I said two weeks
ago with respect to the League of Nationsthis of course may be of littie importanceand also what my honourable friend from
Mille Isles said this afternoon in relation to
this Bill. That is a situation against which
I protest vebemently, and if that is the irnprovement that is going to result from transferring t he control of translation to a department of the Crown, I have not much faith
in it.
1 wish f0 state most empbatically that I
fully concur in the wishes so respectfully expressed by my honourable friends from
Monfarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), from Mille
Isles (Hon. Mr. Prévost) and from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Parent), who ought to know a
lîttle-possibly more than some of ber hionourable gentlemen who have already spoken
this afternoon-about translation and the
meaning of a particular word in either
language.
Hon. LOUIS COTE: Honourable members,
my remarks will be very brief. I have listened
ivith a great deal of interest to what bas
been said this aftemnoon, and although I have
not corne to a conclusion as to wbat my
attitude shall be on the merits of the Bill, I
amn not at ail prepared to say that I shal
vote for if. I amn frank to say that in some
respects it does not at ail appeal to me as
reasonable.
The honourable the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) bas mentioned the
translation of the laws. Probably, because I
am a lawyer myself, I take more than an
ordinary interest in that f orm of translation.
We must all remember, honourable gentlemen, f hat we are legislators. The making of
laws involves not merely the deliberation of
this bouse and the voting on bis and resolutions; it includes also the drafting of laws.
We have, or sbould have, a Law Clerk-we
have borrowed one this session-to do that
work. That is a very important part of the
duties of offleers of the Senate. Making the
French version of tbe laws is equally important. If is a function that transcends
ordinary translation, and is akin to the dlraf t-

433

ing of the law, because, after ail, the French
and the Englisb versions are original versions
before the courts.
I have before me a Bill whicb says tbat the
Minister of a department cao conscript the
translaf ors of the Senafe, including our law
translaf ors, and make of 'thein ordinary civil
servant s responsible f0 another body of men,
the Civil Service Commission, and flot to the
Senate of Canada. I do not like that feafure
of tbe Bill so far as it affects the Senafe. I
arn only a recent appoîntee f0 fbe Senate, and
may be a little more jealous than some of
the older inern.hers of its prerogatives, and
may take tbem too seriously; but it strikes
me tbat the Bill certainly deserves more serutiny than could he given to it in Committea
of the Whole. Personally I sbould like to be
on a eommittee or to see on if sorne other
gentleman wbo would send for the law translators in order to have tbem explain bow tbey
do their work.
I do not think tbere bas been any criticismn
of the work of the law tranglators of the
Senate. I have before me the Frencb version
of the Shipping Act, whiých bas been translafed
by our own translators and moade ready for
distribution at the same tirne as the Englisb
version.
The honouirable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) had the advantage the
other day of listening to Hon. Mr. Caban, an
advantage tbat some of tbe rest of us did not
enjoy. I think that if we had thbe opportunify
of listening to evidence in committee we
rnigbt be better able f0 corne to a conclusion
as to what we sbould do t0 improve this Bill,
if neeessary.
There are other matters that I could discuss
at this time. For instance, I tbink it is plain
to everyone that wben you corne down to the
merits of the measure the real contention is
in regard to two systerns of condncting translation services in the country-tbe centralized
sysfern, witb a chief at the bead, and the
specialized systern under the control of each
department. As the honourable senator from
Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Prévost) bas just said
in French, years ago we bad a centralized
system, but gave that up and decideýd that
each department sbould bave ifs own staff of
experts who would specialize in matters affecting that department. Sorne people think thaf
the Bill before us will destroy the efficieney of
our translation, in that it will tend to destroy
the efficiency of specialization. There rnay
be an answer to that. If may he that there
will be hotb specialization and centralizafion.
Surely those are points about wbicb we are
enfitled to obtain certain information, and if
is my opinion that if the BilIl were to go to

Committee of the Whole we might be deprived of some evidence that could easily be
secured before a select committee. Under the
circumstances, I would very respectfully urge
that the Bill should not be submitted to Committee of the Whole.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bill will
stand until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It cannot stand, it
must move. Committee of the Whole House

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If we were to
assume that the second reading had not yet
been taken, someone could move the adjournment of the debate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The second
reading has been passed, and that is now the

position of the Bill. I have no objection at all
to the Bill standing until to-morrow; in fact,
that is the request I make; but am I to be
told that under the rules of the Senate the Bill
cannot stand in its present position? What
happens to it?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is in limbo.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A Bill does
not become law until it is read the third time
and passed. If our rules do not keep it on
the Order Paper when it has been read the
second time, we had better amend the rules.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Am I to put the
motion that the Bill be referred to Committee of the Whole?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
making that motion.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Can anybody else
do it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I revert
to my suggestion that we retrace our path
one step and move the adjournment of the
debate on the second reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The second
reading is over. If a motion to have this Bill
placed on the Order Paper for to-morrow, to
be dealt with then, will comply with the rules,
I make that motion; but I cannot understand the rules of the Senate compelling a bill
to fall into limbo before it is through this
House.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It would be quite disconcerting.
Hon. Mr. COTE.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion to
go into Committee of the Whole does not
mean that the Bill must be considered in

LEAGUE OF NATIONS
MOTION-DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
McRae:
That this House is of the opinion that
Canada should withdraw from membership in
the League of Nations, and that no further
mouey should be voted to the League.

Hon. CHARLES TANNER: Honourable
members, I may say at once that I have no
intention of entering upon any lengthy discussion of the subject-matter of the motion
before the Senate. I have but one or two
comments and suggestions that I should like
to make before the debate is concluded. We
have had a very lengthy and very interesting

discussion, dealing, I think, with every possible angle. We have had the historical
aspect, the philosophical aspect, the humanitarian aspect, the financial aspect, the war
aspect, and finally the aspect of the League
of Nations as it bas existed. The ground has
been so thoroughly covered that I have no
intention whatever of taking up the time of
the House in rehearsing what has been said.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is plenty of
time.

Hon.

Mr.

TANNER:

The

League

of

Nations has existed for only about fifteen
years. That is a very short period of time
in the history of the world. Moreover, the

League is a human agency, created and conducted by men. I am aware of no human
agency that was ever perfect; and I do not
think that anybody, even the men' who

MAY 30, 1934
created the League, expected that it would
be perfect. At all events, Lloyd George-a
very able man who was in the service of
England at the time-Sir Maurice Hankey,
Lord Riddell, and men like those, had very
serious doubts regarding the efficiency of the
League of Nations. Lloyd George, of course,
lost considerable faith in it when he discovered that although President Wilson had
fathered the idea of the League, the United
States of America refused to come into it;
and he is on record as intimating that he
had great fear respecting its efficiency.
Incidentally, though President Wilson is
credited with originating the idea of the
League, he was not the originator of it at all.
It was General Smuts who originated it; and
in 1919 Sir Maurice Hankey had a plan for
a league drawn out on different lines. President Wilson got possession of General Smuts'
ideas and used them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cited a letter
written by Sir Edward Grey in 1915.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: In the minds of many
people President Wilson gets all the credit
for originating the League, whereas he was
only a copyist. He was like President
Monroe, who stole the Monroe doctrine from
Canning.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It was originated not
by Monroe, but by Canning.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Exactly. That is
right.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: As I said a moment
ago, people have had a great deal of doubt
about the ultimate efficiency of the League,
and its ability to do all the work planned for
it. There is clause 10, which was referred to
by the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach). He thinks it absolutely
essential that a League of Nations, before it
can be of service in the world, must have
back of it an international armed force which
will put into effect by compulsion the decrees
of the League. This Parliament decided, as
my honourable friend pointed out, that clause
10 was not a good one. Notwithstanding the
opinion of my honourable friend from Edmonton, I venture to think that the nations would
never agree upon the creation of any international force of army and navy, and that it
can never be created within the short space of
time ahead of any of us. As for discovering
somebody to take command of such a force,
all we have to do is to remember what happened in the Great War: it was only in the
last moments and in the face of final danger
74728-28à

435

that the Allies were willing to agree upon a
single command. To my mind clause 10 is
wholly impracticable; it could never be carried
out. But is that a reason for destroying the
League? In my judgment it is not. There
still is great and beneficial work for the
League to do. More than 'one hundred
years ago, when the plenipotentiaries of Great
Britain and European nations met at Paris to
draft the Treaty of Paris, one of the ablest
of foreign secretaries that England ever had,
Lord Castlereagh, made a very cryptic and
forceful remark. He said, "It is not our business to collect trophies, but to try to bring
the world back to peaceful habit." In 1929
the Allied representatives were too busy collecting trophies and laying up trouble for the
future, and their activities in trying to bring
the world back to peaceful habits were to a
certain extent nullified.
Suppose Canada did decide to withdraw
from the League of Nations. How would
that affect the standing of this country in
its relation with the Empire and the world
at large? We are taught nowadays to believe that this Canada of ours has arrived at
national status, that we are an independent
nation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
My honourable
friend is shaking his head. I agree with him
that we are not as far advanced in that
direction as we think we are.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Nevertheless it is
commonly believed that we are an independent nation, and a member of a Commonwealth of independent nations.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Can we declare
war?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am not arguing
with my honourable friend on the subject.
I think there is considerable misconception
about it, but there is no doubt that we are
known throughout the world as an independent nation, as a prominent member of the
great British Commonwealth of Nations. In
this House we are now engaged in the consideration of a very important measure, the
Shipping Bill, which calls for the reciprocation
of all the Empire countries for the protection
of our ships, our people and our goods. Suppose we say to the League of Nations: "We
are going to drop out. You are an organization for keeping peace in the world, but we
think you are not doing much good; so we
are going to look after ourselves." Now, in
spite of any action we take here, we shall

SENATE
have to continue doing business with foreign
countries. And in what position should we
be when any question arose about protecting
our people, our ships, our goods and our
national interests? As a matter of fact we
should be powerless.
Granted that the League of Nations is not
as wholly effective as we should like it to be,
is that a reason why we should, so to speak,
declare war against the whole world by resigning from the only peace-making organization that exists? Since we do not pretend to
be able to defend ourselves against aggression,
nor to go to the farthermost parts of the
earth in defence of our interests and our
people, I submit we should remain in the
League. Let us stick to this organization
which will help us to protect ourselves.
It is commonly said that next to England
we are the biggest toad in the British puddle.
Canada is the greatest DominionHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

What about India?

Hon. Mr. TANNER: We are influential in
the Empire, and we have a good deal of influence in the world. It bas been stated, and
I have no doubt with truth, that the eyes of
a large part of the world are on this Senate
to-day and people are wondering whether we
are going to declare against a peace-making
organization, to eut oursolves adrift and take
our chance. It is my opinion, honourable
members, that we should remain in the
League and cast whatever influence we have
on behalf of that organization, its work, and
its prospects for further usefulness. Let that
go out to the world as our stand, and let it
be known tîat we are not going te sever relations with that great institution which was
founded for the purpose of maintaining, or
attempting to maintain, peace in the world.
If we decided to withdraw from the League
we should have to notify the Mother Country of our decision. Old England would
probably turn a smiling face to us and say:
"All right; but we intend to stay in. We
suppose you will lay in a store of arms for
your own protection, because you certainly
will not expect us to send over ships or
armaments or men to protect you if you get
into trouble." That would be a reasonable
attitude for England and the other parts of
the Empire to take. They would likely argue
that if Canada is satisfied she can run ber
own show in an absolutely independent way,
she should be permitted to make the experiment, but that they would not on that account
waver in their allegiance to the League.
It bas already been suggested that any
action we might take with respect to the
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

League should b taken in stop with the other
members of the British Commonwealth, and
that we should not withdraw unless England
and the other Dominions decide to do the
same thing. As was said by my honourable
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach),
the British Empire is the greatest peacemaker
in the world. It will occupy that role for
many long years to come, and in my judgment we should continue along with other
members of the Empire in sticking to the
League.
I do not intend to go into details concerning the League's accomplishments. Honourable members on both sides of the House have
conclusively shown that although the League
bas not been as effective as its promoters
hoped it would be, it bas done some very
great work for the benefit of the world.
Aside from these achievements, which prove
its efficiency in many respects, there is the allimportant fact that the League exists as an
organization for the purpose of maintaining
peace. I suggest that honourable members
ask themselves whether the world would not
be a great deal worse off if that organization
no longer existel.
Mv
onourable friend
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
shakos his head. He bas nO faith in human
nature; he is worse than the man of little
faith. I believe in human nature, and am
convinced that had there heen no League of
Nations during the last fifteen years conditions might have been a great deal worse than
they are to-day.
Hon. Mr. CAXSGRAIN:

Or better.

Hon. Mr. FANNER:
My honourable
friend is entitled to his own views. But I say
that the very existence of such an organization, backed by the British Empire and all
other member countries-despite the abence
of the United States, which should -have corne
in, and may yet come in-has had a wholesome influence on the international atmosphere. We have to remember that we are
a peaceful people, living in a peaceful country. Europe bas always been armed defensivelyv, sometimes aggressively, and undoubtedly will long continue so. The European
people have been brought up undor war conditions for centuries. As bas been pointed
out in the course of this debate, their boundary lines have constantly been the subject
of bitter dispute. We may think we need
have no very close association with European
countries, but we cannot help ourselves, as
we discovered when the Great War started.
All the great European powers were more
or less prepared for the great conflagration

ready to fight France. It may be possible
through the agency of the League to prevent
or at least to postpone another world disaster. The Polish dispute was settled by
moral suasion, and it is reasonable to believe
that other important international differences
could be composed in a similar way.
We all know that several nations have
withdrawn from the League, but it is reported
that some of them are likely to -come back.
I know that if my honourable friend from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) had his
way, he would not let them come back.
Fortunately he has no say in the matter.
It has been said that our membership in
the League costs us a considerable sum of
money. But what are a few hundred thousand dollars, especially to a country like this?
Does Canada not get good value for the
money it spends on the League? Is it not
worth while to receive a report like the one
we got a couple of days ago, stating that
Canada is lead-ing the whole world in industrial development?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They sent that because they heard of the motion for our
withdrawal.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That report came
from the economie section of the League of
Nations. I am going to vote for our continuance in the League on that account if on
no other. Why complain about the expenditure of a little money when we can get such
encouragement as that?
To some extent the League may have
failed. But even my honourable friend from
De Lanaudière fails sometimes. He failed
when in 1904 he made many long speeches in
favour of our assuming the railway burden
that is now costing us a million dollars a
week. He would not take that stand to-day.
I submit, honourable members, that our
duty is not to withdraw from the League and
endeavour to destroy it, but to remain as
members and try to improve it wherever we
can. It may be possible to make revisions
to good effect in its constitution and its
methods of procedure, to make its work more
efficient and to reduce its expenditures. But

465

if we withdrew we should not be able to
work towards any of these ends, for we should
be on the outside looking in; we should have
no influence at all. Let us stay on the inside
and endeavour to induce the United States,
and all other great po.wers that now are outside, to come in with us. Let us try to make
the League a clearing-house for peaceful
efforts and for other activities through which
very valuable service can be rendered to the
whole world.
With all deference I submit that this Senate
should not dispose of this motion by simply
taking a vote on it. We should make a
positive and definite declaration in support
of the League of Nations, and that should
be written into our record. I therefore am
moving an amendment to the motion of my
honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae). I am not particular about the
wording of the amendment, and I shall have
no objection if honourable members wish to
make some changes, so long as it remains a
positive expression of support of the League.
As I have drafted it, the amendment reads:
That all the words of the motion after the
first "That," line one, be struck out and the
following be substituted:
considering that several nations have wdthdrawn support from the League of Nations, the
Senate of Canada, regretting the adverse
impression thus created, recognizing that the
League in many of its activities has achieved
substantial and beneficial results, declares the
opinion that Canada should continue membership in the League and act in concert with
the United Kingdom and the sister Dominions;
and should exert its influence to bring about
such revision of the constitutional authority,
duty and procedure of the League as may be
advisable and be likely to enlist the co-operation of the Great Powers and other nations
of the world for maintenance of peace and
betterment generally of world conditions.
That is all I have to say, honourable senators. I submit this amendment for the consideration of the House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rise to a point of
order. I submit that the proposed amendment,
being entirely contrary to the motion, is out
of order.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is a point of
order well taken until the amendment is
seconded.

SENATE

My honourable friend from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) has said that in another
House the question of the flag has arisen and
been disposed of. I do not know officially
vhat has taken place in the Commons that
bears on the question of a flag for Canada.
The very small change now proposed bas to
do only with the flag of our mercantile
marine; and it is beeause we are now dealing
with the mercantile marine that J ask whether
we cannot cure the defects I have referred to
by placing in the fly of the flag a green maple
leaf instead of the shield I have described.
This change was accepted in the committee,
and I intend to vote against the amendment
of my honourable friend.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
gentlemen, I am in entire agreement with my
honourable friend as far as his complete
statement of the facts and his argument are
concerned, but I disagree with him in regard
to the action be recommends.
There are in my opinion three main points
to be borne in mind when we approach the
question of a national flag for Canada. I
have given the matter some thought. I have
collected considerable very useful information,
and I now have some very excellent designs
based upon a formula whicb I think will be
acceptable to most honourable gentlemen.
This formula is that wlhen considering a
national flag we should have regard for the
fact that the Union Jack represents the
English, Irish and Scotch nationalities; that
we have in this country a fourth nationality,
the French of Canada; and that when we
come to construct our flag we should give
that nationality proper representation.
Honourable members of the House will be
interested to learn that there is a whole
library of books containing the laws of
beraldry and rules governing flags. If, after
proper inquiry and an observation of those
rules, we evolve a national flag which is acceptable to our people, we can then derive
from it a number of other flags-a flag for
our navy, a flag for our government marine,
and a flag for our mercantile marine. My
objection to the honourable gentleman's proposal is that be seeks to do first the thing
that we ought to do last. If we are to proceed logically, we should first arrive at a
design for a national flag, and then develop
from it the other designs.
If the proposal of the honourable gentleman is acceded to, what will be the practical
results? There are 1,700.000 tons of registered
Canadian shipping. I do not know what is
the average tonnage of our ships, but it is
safe to say that from 1,000 to 1,500 Canadian
ships will be required to alter their flags
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

immediately. If two years hence we decide
on a national flag and set ourselves to the
task of elaborating from it a merchant marine
flag, we shall be compelled either to follow
the honourable gentleman's design or to
evolve a new one. This would oblige 1.500
ships again to alter their flags, and vould be
bound to create dissatisfaction and a belief
that in this matter we did not know what
we were about. ,So while I am compelled
as Chairman of the Committee to introduce
the report containing this objectionable
amendmentRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Not so very
objectionable.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -and am debarred
from seconding the amendment of the bonourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), I would suggest that the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) withdraw
his proposal.
If he is not prepared to do
that, the House would be well advised, I
think, to vote for the amendment of the
honourable senator from Alma, se that our
hands may not be tied when we come to
deal with the interesting and perhaps difficult
question of a national flag.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that although my honourable friend agrees
with the principles I have laid down and
the statement I have made, be would like to
postpone the consideration of this question
until a national flag may be decided upon.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As my honourable friend has noted, it was declared in
1922, by Order in Council, that the shield
bearing the new coat of arms should replace
the old shield, but it was added t·hat the
use of the flag with the old shield would be
permitted up to March, 1924. If the amendment of my honourable friend from Alma
does not carry, I intend to move to add at
the end of the clause that it shall come into
force only upon proclamation of the Governor in Council. Then if there is any likelihood of the question of a national flag being
discussed within a reasonable time, the
Governor General in Council can suspend
the operation of this clause.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I find myself considerably embarrassed
in taking issue with the views expressed by
my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
and at the same time being in almost entire
agreement with the honourable senator from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) on this particular question.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Oh, oh.

MAY 31, 1934
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not believe
it would do any harm to place on record just
what, if I am correct, the Senate is asked to
scrap or tbrow to one side. Section 89
reads:
(1) The red ensign usually worn by merchant
ships, with the shield of Canada in the fly is
hereby declared to be the proper national
colours for all ships registered in Canada, and
all ships and boats which would be registered
in Canada if they were required to be registered at all belonging to any British subject
resident in Canada except in the case of any
ship or boat for the time being allowed to
wear any other national colours in pursuance
of a warrant from His Majesty or under regulations which may be made by the Governor
in Council.
(2) If any distinctive national colours, except
such red ensign or except the Union Jack with
a white border, or if any colours usually worn
by His Majesty's ships or resembling those of
His Majesty, or if the pendant usually carried
by His Majesty's ships or any pendant resembling that pendant, are or is hoisted on board
any ship or boat registered in Canada or
belonging to any British subject resident in
Canada without warrant from His Majesty or
under the aforesaid Regulations, the master
of the ship or boat, or the owner thereof, if
on board the same, and every other person
hoisting the colours or pendant, shall for each
offence be liable to a fine not exceeding twentyfive hundred dollars.
Now I want to place before the Senate
certain views that occur to me on this subject.
We are asked to scrap, or to put to one side,
the ensign that heretofore bas been used,
which has denoted above all things, I think,
and more than the maple leaf would do,
membership in the British Empire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Union Jack?

What about the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I can very readily
imagine what may develop if the views of my
honourable leader prevail. If a ship carrying
the maple leaf of Canada were in Singapore
or some foreign port, and because of mutiny
or piracy armed assistance were required,
where would it be secured? The only power
to which we can look for such assistance is tbe
British Empire. It seems to me that it will
be high time for the Senate or the rest of the
lawmakers of Canada to enact that we shall
have a separate symbol of this kind when we
are prepared to pay our share of the piper's
fees, and to help provide that continuous and
never-ending watchfulness that is sO necessary to the shipping of Canada and that of
the rest of the British Empire. Why should
we say that we are going to adopt an emblem
of our own, the maple leaf-an emblem which
I honour and revere-and then demand, and
expect to receive, the ample protection of the
British navy? Some day, no doubt, Canada

441

will have a distinctive flag and a distinctive
emblem of ber own; but it will be one that
designates membership in the British Commonwealth of Nations. I hope that when
that time comes we shall be prepared to help
pay our share towards maintaining the protection which is so necessary, and which now is
afforded by the British Empire.
I am in favour of leaving section 89 as it
stands, until such time as we are ready to
deal with the entire question of a Canadian
flag.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I regret that I was not
able to be present at the session of the Banking and Commerce Committee when this
question came up for discussion. Had I
been there, the few remarks that I make
now would have been made then.
I endorse very largely what has been said
by the honourable senator who bas just taken
his seat (Hon. Mr. Murdock) and the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach). Coming from a maritime province, and baving had to do in a small way
with shipping since I was a boy, I must say
that I have not heard any complaints about
the visibility of the shield at present displayed on the flag of our mercantile marine,
nor have I ever heard sea-going masters of
Canadian ships request that the coat of arms
of Canada should be eliminated from that
flag and some other insignia be displayed in
its stead. I am confident that had there been
any such complaints they would have
registered in my mind, in which case I should
have had no hesitation in stating them.
Furthermore, honourable gentlemen, I do not
think there has been any request for a change
from the shipping interests or the ship owners
of Canada.
If that is the fact, and I think it is the
indisputable fact, why should we make this
change in our flag now? In all probability,
owing to our efforts to reach the status of an
independent nation, it will not be long before
Canada has a distinctive flag of ber own. I
am bound to say that a flag with some distinguishing mark is, I think, the ultimate outcome and result of the course that we have
been travelling during the last six or eight
years; and so long as the insignia of the
British Empire are properly placed on that
flag, and we do not lose sight of the fact
that we are bound to that Empire for sentimental and other reasons, I do not think I
would offer any serious objection.
If the honourable leader opposite will
pardon me for questioning anything he saysa thing which I rarely do, for I have the

442

SENATE

greatest respect for him-I should like to say
that so far as visibility is concerned, I do not
think there would be any difference between a
green maple leaf and the coat of arms of
Canada, of the same size. If the maple leaf
were placed on a white background, or in a
circle, it might be more visible than the present coat of arms, but, after all, the difference
would be so slight that I do not think it
would be noticed by passing ships or by any
mariner or passenger; and I am satisfied that
the sailors themselves could find no reasonable
justification for the proposed change, if
visibility is the only ground upon which it is
to be made.
Further, while we are talking about the
emblem, I maintain that the arms of Canada
in the fly of the flag are much more handsorne and presentable than the maple leaf.
We have the maple leaf in our coat of arms,
and I can sec no advantage in making a
change at the present time. I can see what
to me and to other people interested in shipping would be an objectionable feature. Even
if the suggested limitations are put in, I shall
have to change the present flag, which bears
the coat of arms of Canada, for another flag
with a maple leaf on it. In common with
every other ship owner and shipping man, I
shall have to spend some money to make a
change that will have no significance and
will net improve the present situation. Unless we can get some real benefit from the
change-and I do not think we can-we ought
not to make it. We should keep our present
merchant marine flag until such time as we
decide on a distinctive flag for Canada as a
whole. Because that is my sincere opinion, I
arn going to support the amendment.
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, this discussion has done something:
it has committed a number of honourable
gentlemen to a Canadian flag. We have just
heard some speeches that have gone further
than I ever went in favour of a Canadian
fiag. If I needed anything to convince me
that Canada will shortly have a flag of her
own, the necessary conviction has been supplied by the speeches of my honourable friends
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) and
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black). The
adoption of a Canadian flag will not signify
that we are giving up our standing in the
British Commonwealth of Nations; it will
but confirm the fact that we are a very
essential part of that Commonwealth.
I cannot for the life of me understand why
any person should shy from discussing a thing
of this kind. Among speeches I have chosen
to read, out of the vast flood of oratory, have
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

been some which indicate that the speakersnot members of this House-seem to think
the mere suggestion of a Canadian flag is
almost unholy. Any person who believes that
the proposal for a national flag implies a
desire to discontinue the use of the old Union
Jack, which we all admire, is entirely wrong.
The proposers simply wish to have a distinctive mark which would be recognized by
other members of the Commonwealth as
emblematic of Canada. Australia has her own
flag and she is not disloyal; on the contrary
I suppose she is more loyal than London is.
We have come a long way. Years ago
when it was said that Canada was a nation
some people did not believe it, but now
those very people are proud of the fact and
boast of it. They even want to have a
national flag. And I think they are right.
Surely the marine flag proposed in this Bill
is not in opposition to that idea. The only
objection I have is that the Bill does not
go far enough and propose an altogether
national flag, so that we could develop from
the top down. This marine proposal might
be a development from the bottom up.
Now, what is proposed here? I was impressed with a remark made in the Banking
and Commerce Committee by an official of
the Department of Marine. When we were
discussing this very thing he rose in his
place and expressed himself quite emphatically-spoke almost out of his turn. He
said, "Gentlemen, remember that you want
a marine flag that can be seen." That really
helped to convince me that we need some
change in the present marine flag. My honoura;ble friend from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black) says he has heard no criticism of it.
I suppose the same remark could have been
made at the time of the previous change, in
the administration of my right honourable
friend opposite. At least, I think it was in
his administrationRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A great deal
occurred in a short time.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Much was
compressed into a short period. At that time
there was a substitution of the coat of arms
of the Dominion of Canada for the emblemas
of the four original provinces.
Our coat of arms is a lovely thing, and no
one admires it more than I do. The object
of this marine flag is not so much to proclaim our loyalty as to indicate to other
ships that any vessel bearing it is a Canadian vessel. It would require a man with
very strong eyesight te make out the details
of our coat of arms at any considerable
distance.

MAY 31, 1934
Since the composition of that wonderful
song, "The Maple Leaf For Ever," the people
of all nations have learned to uriderstand that
the leaf of our splendid maple tree is the
emblem of Canada. I once had an interesting
little experience in trying to explain the
Canadian coat of arms to a stranger. By the
time a man is old he has had a great number
of experiences. I was spending a summer at
Staten Island and I searched around for a
flag to put up in front of my cottage. The
only thing I could find was a marine flag, and
I hoisted that. Presently an old lady came
along, who said she knew w'hat the Union
Jack was, but she was puzzled by the other
emblem in the flag. I explained as best I
could, but I am sure she did not understand
what I was talking about. Had it been the
maple leaf instead of the coat of arms, there
would have been no difficulty at all, for I
should have had to say simply, "That is the
maple leaf, the emblem of Canada." As it
was with the old lady, so it is with men on
ships and men connected with shipping all
over the world.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, when this question came before the
committee I opposed the motion then made
by the honourable senator who leads the other
side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and did so for
reasons which were not at the time expressed,
but remain unchanged. I am in full accord
with the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) that there
is no question of loyalty involved in the discussion, and I do not know why the subject
should be particularly shunned, or thought
to be full of powder. I look at it rather
calmly. But I think I see practical reasons
why we should not make the change called
for in the motion which carried at the committee.
I am net now making a statement one
way or the other as to whether there should
be a distinctive national flag for Canada. I

do not think that is germane to the discussion.
But I could see a better case for the proposed

change if based on the assumption that the
flag of Canada is to remain as it is, rather
than on a contrary assumption. The merchant marine flag which honourable gentlemen
opposite want might not be as good as what
we already have, or it might be a little better.

I think I could give a reason, not yet advanced, why it would not be as good.

But

there would be no serious objection to it, for
it would bear a logical and sensible relation
to our present national flag and would differ
from it only with respect to the fly.

443

Before I go further I will give the reason
why I think the flag desired by honourable
members opposite would not be as good as
what we now have. I do not know whether
the visibility would be better or worse, though
I am told that a green maple leaf would not
have much merit from the standpoint of
visibility. But here is an important point. It
is the mercantile marine flag, I am advised,
which is flown by our Ministers and representatives in foreign lands. For instance, it is
flown over the Canadian legations at Tokyo
and at Washington. It would seem to me
rather unwise to substitute the maple leaf for
the shield of Canada on those flags. What
more would the maple leaf represent?
Our coat of arms was altered in 1921, as the
right honourable senator from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) has pointed out.
The alteration was not substantial, but was
required in order that we might keep in step
with the development of our Dominion, for
we then had nine provinces, whereas the coat
of arms represented only four. The new coat
of arms was merely an outgrowth, an expansion, of the old one. In 1922, I think in
April of that year, the incoming Government
saw fit to authorize the use of the shield,
which is the central part of the coat of arms,
instead of the whole coat of arms, in the fly
of the mercantile marine flag. I do not know
why that step was taken, but I am not criticizing it. The point I make now is that it
would seem to me not at al appropriate that
we in this Senate should change the mercantile
marine flag and thereby take the shield of
Canada from the flag which is flown over our
legations in vari.ous parts of the world.
The reasons I have so far given are
applicable on the assumption that we do not
contemplate there will at some time be a
change in the national flag of Canada. But
if we do contemplate such a change, surely
it is not best to start at the derivative and
thereby tie our hands so that we should not
have an absolutely free choice when the time
came to design a primary flag. How do we
know that we should want such prominence
given to the maple leaf in that flag? Why
should we seek now to determine just what
the character of our national flag will be? I
have no objection to the maple leaf, but I
think the mercantile marine flag should be derived from the national flag, instead of the
opposite procedure being followed. I know
there are very many Canadians who look
forward to our having at a not distant date
a flag of our own, emblematic of the Empire,
signifying all that the Empire signifies, but at

SENATE
the same time distinctive of Canada. Surely
they do net want to have the character and
design of that flag predetermined by the
adoption of a new mercantile marine flag at
this time.
For the reasons I have given, I support
the amendment.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Ballantyne
was agreed to on the following division:

CONSIDER.ED

IN

COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Senate went into Commitee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Black in the Chair.
Riglt Hotu. Mi. MEIGHEN.

The CHAIRMAN:
Honourable senators,
unless it is the will of the Committee. I
dlo not intend to read or to name the sectiens. Any particular section to wh:ch an
honourable senator may desire to direct attention will be taken up.
Representatives
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
of the marine engineers, who naturally arc
very much interested in this Bill, have atsed
me to bring one or two matters to the attention of the Committee.
They take exceoption to the interpretation
of nominal hor-e-power.
I find it at page
6 of the first reprint:
"Nominal horse-pow er" means the measure of
the size of marine engines, ascertained in
auordance with regulations made from time to
time by the Governor in Council.
They submit that brake or shaft hore-power
be substituted for nominal horse-power in
computing the power of all turbine and internal combustion engines, and that indicated
horse-power be used in computing the power
of recinrocating steam engines. I would ask
the chairman of the standinz committee, the
honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach), w-ho. I know, has dcvoted a
grcat deal of time to an exhaustive study of
the Bill, to give the marine enginceers the
ieaon wh' the term nominal horse-power is
used instead of actual horse-power.
The question
Hon. Mr. CRIESBACH:
raised by the honourable gentleman fron
Parkdale came before both the standing committee and the subcommittee and received
the careful consideration of all concerned.
The marine engineers of course were in favour
of brake horse-power, for the reason that it
raises the power to be attributed to a given
engine, and this in turn under the regulations would necessitate the employment of
certificated engineers.
It may interest the Committee to know
that although scientists have been able to
discover the nominal horse-power by a formula which produces an absolute result, yet
in the ascertainment of brake horse-power
opinions may differ on the results obtained.
The officials of the Department favoured
us with this scientific explanation:
Nominal horse-power is a measure of a size
of an engine, and is found by taking the sum
of the squares of the diameters of all the
cylinders and dividing by thirty.
That presents no apparent difficulty.
Brake horse-power is a measure of the actual
power of an engine in foot-pounds per minute.
Brake horse-power is found by putting a brake
on the fly wheel of an engine, fron which the
pull exerted is found. This pull in pounds

44à

The mari-ne en-

muitiplied by the circumference of the brake
in feet iuiiltiplied by the revolutions per minute
of the engine is the brake horse-power.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
gineers?

In elucidation of this we were informed
that:
Shaît horse-power is actuaiiy the samne as
brake horse-power, but is the expression used
in deaiing with large engines. To find the
shaft horse-power it is necessary to measure
the angular advance of the shaft wjth the use
of a torsion meter.
The members of the standing committee
followved this expianation as far as they were
able, but discussion collapsed when we were
told that even if we adopted the brake horsepower methoýd of determining actuaa horsepower, the officiais oi the Department would
soon find a way oif circumvention by another
scientifie formula which would be utteri
beyond the comprehiension of the committee !

The CHAIR MAN: No; those interested in
the grain trade.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask a further question? I understand that an American
vessel can ioad a cargo at Fort William and
unioad it at Port Coiborne, but that a Canadian vessel cannot ioad a cargo at Duluth
and undoad àt at Buffalo. The marine engineers ask why something aiong these linos
shouid not be inciuded in the Shipping Bi1
NL'oship, other than a British ship of Canadien registry, shail take part or engage in the
coastal trade of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJGHEN: I am afraid
we must admit thero is a good deal of truth
in the honourable senator's complaint. In
respect of grain, Amnerican boats can enter
the coastai trade of Canada, but Canadian
boats cannot enter the coastai trade of the
United States. This Bill contains provisions
to remeciy this condition-provisions already
ombodied in the daw, but to become effective
oniy by Order in Council. The honýourable
senator bas beon in publie life long enough
to know the pressure brought to bear by the
grain interests of the West. Apparently there
is a suspicion that Canadian boats are con-

trolied by a combine and if American boats
were -excluded from this coastal trade freight
rates would he unduiy increased. If the provisions were made effective by the necessary
Ordor in Council, the Bill would be free from
the objection the honourable gentleman advances.
The ýCHAIRMAN: It is only fair to say
that those interested appeared before the
standing committee this year, and aiso last
year, and protested ver vigorously against
the prohibition whieh the honourable senator
from Parkdaie favours.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What the hionourable senator from Parkdale desires on behaif of the marine engineers je already in the
law, and is reaffirmed as a part of this Bull.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is correct.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Parliament can
do no more than enact this Bill, unless it be
deemed advisaible to omit the section giving
the Government authority to bring the coasting trade restrictions into force by proclamation.
'Right Hon. M'r. MEIGHEN: I may say
that when, a year ago, representatives of the
VVheat Pools solem-nly warned the standing
committee against any restrictions being
plac-ed upon American vessels engaging in
Canadian coastal trade, and pointed out the
awfuil consequenees of inýcreased freight rates
to the Western fiarmers, the honourable senator from Aima reminded them that the Hudson Bay route was open and had ail the advantages it ever had as a shieid and buekier
against this monopoly of the shipping interests; but hie made no impression.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The Clerk of the
Committee was instructed to insert the corresponding numbers. He reports that he has
done so and that the numbering will appear

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. COTE moved the second reading
of Bill 28, an Act to incorporate Ancient
Foresters' Mutual Life Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, it may be
that a few words of explanation are appropriate at this time. The Ancient Order of
Foresters were incorporated many years ago,
under a charter which gave them power to
carry on a life insurance business. They have
carried on that business, and to-day have
about 7,700 policyholders. But as the policyholders, very few of whom are members of
the fraternai society, have nothing to say
about the administration of the fund to which
thcy have so largely contributed, they now
seek to be incorporated as a mutual life insurance company. The Bill is quite simple;
and when it has been read the second time
I shall moe that it be referred to the
Comnittee on Banking and Commerce.

REFERRED TO INTERNAL
COMMITTEE

ECONOMY

Hon. Mr. McRAE moved that the Senate
go into Committee of the Whole on Bill 4,
an Act respecting the Bureau for Translations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The motion
is made that the Senate go into Committee
of the Whole. If the honourable senator
(Hon. Mr. McRae) will be good enough to
withdraw his motion, I shall move that the
Bill be referred ta the Select Standing ComHon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

mittee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts. I shall not proceed further unless
I have the concurrence of the honourable
member.
The Han. the SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to withdraw his motion?
The motion was withdrawn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The principle
of this Bill was discussed at considerable length
in this House yesterday, and the whole subject
has been thoroughly reviewed in the other
Chamber.
The comments made yesterday
indicate some apprehension that under the
better organized translation service whieh the
Bill contemplates there would be no provision
for specialized translators. especially in the
Senate, to carry on the work of translating
bills, and, I presume, other documents, and
speeches. I am not strongly impressed with
the grounds of such apprehension; but if there
is such an apprehension in the minds of honourable members, the Committee on Internal
Econom., inasmuch as it is responsible for the
disposition of all who come under the prerogative of this House, would appear to be
the appropriate committee to deal with the
Bill.
I want to say, though, that to refer to any
committee other than Committùe of the
Whole a Bill which has alrclady b en
thoroughly reviewed in the other Chamber
is somewhat a departure. The usual pirpose
(i reference to a select committee is not only
to afford opportunity for intimate examination and the freest possible review of the
details, but also to permit persons who are
speciaily interested to be heard. To hear
such persons twice does not seem quite necessary, and, I think, would not contribute to
the better working of our system. I know
there is no constitutional objection to this
procedure, but I think the committee woulld
be welil advised to prevent any abuse of
privilege and check any endeavour to bog the
Bill in the mire of a committee. While every
reasonable opportunity will be given for presentation of the views of those ispecially
interested, the committee, I am sure, will see
that the Bill is not delayed unnecessarily,
and that we have it here again at no distant
date.
I move that the Bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is one
further advantage in having this Bill before
the Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Aceounts rather than before some

moved an amendment to that motion, and
the bonourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.

the ground that the amendment proposed
.was a direct negative of the main motion.
But the amendment goes further; it not

the thing asked for by the bonourable senator
from Vancouver, but says:
That Canada shou]d continue membership in

of the constitutional authority, duty and pro.
cedure of the League as may be advisable and

Powers.
It seems to me tbat is not a mere negative,
but a broadening out, and an expression of
opinion in another way.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This discussion is
on the point of order?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURD)OCK: Tben it would not
be improper for me to speak on it. I raised
the point of order, and, if I can read the
English language, the bonourable senator wbo
bas just spoken is surely mistaken. Let us
read tbe motion of the bonourable senator
from Vancouver, and the amendment of the
honourable senator from Pictou. The motion
of the bonourable senator from Vancouver is:
That this Hanse is of the opinion that
Canada should withdraw fromn membership in

wbich bas been under discussion for many
weeks. It is a proposai to withdraw from and
te vote ne more money te the League.
Let me read the amendment of the honourable senator fromn Pictou and place it on
record. It is:
That ail the words of the motion after the
first word "That," in line one, be struck eut
.
and the following substituted therefor:
"ceonsidering that several nations have withNations,

the Senate of Canada, regretting the adverse

revision of the constitutional authority, duty
and procedure of the League as may be advisable and be likely te enlist the co-operation of
the Great Powers and other nations of the
world for maintenance of peace and betterment
generally of world conditions.'
The amendment-may I say it without being unkind or unfafr?-is simply an effort te

a grand-stand repudiation of the idea, that

SENATE

posed. The amendment is a direct and absolute negative.
Honourable gentlemen will
pardon me for saying, as I always say, what
I think and mean, whether others agree with
it or not. May I as a humble layman refer
to what I regard as remarkable impudenceand I say this without the slightest intention
of being offensive-the remarkable impudence
of undertaking to pass a resolution containing these words:
(onsidering that several nations have withdrawno support from the League of Nations.
Every honourable senator knows that the
nationw referred to are not yet out of the
ague; that the regulations are such that
the withdrawal docs not become effective for
two or three years. Do we want the British
Empire and the other nations that are endeavouring to carry on the League to think
that we have the temerity to express regret
at the withdrawal of certain nations when
ail chey have done is to give notice of
withdrawal?
It seems to me that Canada
could very well afford to leave a question
of that kind to be raised bv the Motherland
or sore other country which is shouldering
greater responsibilities, bearing larger expenses
and doing more work than we are in maintaining peace in the world. I submit we
should not attempt to minimize the importanee of the discuss;ion that has been going
on here. and the notoriety that Pas resulted,
because of the motion made in the Sonate
some weeks ago by the honourable senator
from Vancouver. I cannot read German, but
I am told that after that motion was made
the German papers published articles stating
that Canada had decided to withdraw from
the League of Nations. I think that is mnost
unfortunate. I know there has been a great
deal of notorietvRiit lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
seuators, I think J should rise to a point
of order. The honourable gentleman from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) started to
discus the point he raised yesterday, to the
effect thiat the amendment. being a direct
negative. is not in order. If I may sav so.
I igre with him on that point. But he
cannot niake the discussion of that point
a reaoan for dealing with the anendment
itsolf. If the amendment is out of order it
should he so declared.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg my right
honourable friend's pardon. He is entirely
right. I was rather enthused on the subject.
Honourable senators, I contend that the
words "should continue mombership in the
League" are positively and unqualifiedly a
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

direct negative of the motion by the honourable senator from Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
Honourable members, so far as I am personally concerned, it
is a matter of indifference whether the objection of my honourable friend from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) prevails or not. The
views I desired to express have been expressed and are now in the records of the
House.
In submitting the amendment My
desire was to crystallize my views in a few
words. My hon.ourable friend from Parkdale,
I am sorry to say, is not a leader I should
like to follow on a question of parliamentary
practice. He was proceeding to discuss the
whole subject a moment ago, whereas the
matter presently before the Sonate is of very
small compass. While raising a parliamentary
objection, a point of order, my honourable
friend seems to have no landmarks whatever
for his own guidance.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Stiek to the text.

You are

right.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I should like to put
the matter, as I see it, before the Sonate in
a brief form. The motion of the honourable
senator from Vancouver declares that in the
opinion of the Sonate Canada should withdraw from membership in the League of
Nations. That is the whole motion, except
for the part dcaling with finances. It i
lementary that a mnerely negative amendment cannot be con-idered, for very good
reasons, which it is hardly necessary to mention. It is only a waste of time to propose
an amendment which merely contradicts, as
it were-which is a more negative of the
mot ion. For example, if I should propose
an amendment to strike out the whole of
the honourable gentleman's motion and substitute the words "that in the opinion of tliis
Senate Canada should not withdraw from
the League of Nation," that would be simply
a negative amendmcnt and out of order.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does my
honourable friend's amendment say anything
more than that, except to add a few apologies?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I shall come to that
question in a minute, if the right honourable
gentleman will give me time. I am simply
trying to demonstrate that it would be a
waste of time te propose such an amendment
and stop there. We had this afternoon an
illustration of what kind of amendment may
be made. There was a motion before the
House that the Sonate concur in the report
of the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
and my honourable friend who sits in front

MAY 31, 1934

of me (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) moved an
amendment. If he had simpIy moved that
the Senate do not concur in the report, he
would have been proposing a mere negative.
But he did not stop there: in addition to
moving that the report be not adopted he
proposed a certain change in the wording of
a section. Therefore he was quite in order,
as I understand it, under the practices of
Parliament.
What is called the six months' hoist may
be moved with respect to any bill. When
a motion is made that a bill be now read,
any honourable member may rise in his place
and move that it be read not now, but this
day six months. That is a perfectly proper
amendment, because it submits a proposition
different from that contained in the motion.
If the amendment were only that the bill
be not now read, it would be a mere negative
and out of order.
My amendment, I submit, is not a mere
It expresses regret in certain
negative.
respects and pronounces confidence in the
League of Nations. It proposes that Canada
should not only retain its membership, but
should do certain other things. That was
my argument, that Canada should not merely
retain its membership, but should co-operate
with the United Kingdom and other Dominions in exerting influence towards a revision
of the League's constitution, authority and
duty, for the purpose of enlisting the active
support of all the great powers in the maintenance of peace and the betterment of the
world generally. The motion is that Canada
should withdraw from membership in the
League.
I am satisfied to leave the case without
further debate to authority that I think is
as sound as the opinion of my honourable
friend from Parkdale. On the subject of
amendments, May's Parliamentary Practice,
twelfth edition, has this to say, at page 258:
The object of an amendment may be to effect
such an alteration in a question as will obtain
the support of those who, without such alteration, must either vote against it or abstain
from voting thereon, or to present to the bouse
an alternative proposition either wholly or
partially opposed to the original question.
My honourable friend from Parkdale said
yesterday that my amendment was bad because it opposed the original motion. Of
course it opposes the original motion. It
would not be worth a bawbee if it did not.
And it is perfectly in order, according to
May, who goes on to explain:
This may be effected by moving to omit all
the words of the question after the first word,
"That'-

449

-precisely what I have donc-and to substitute in their place other words
of a different import. In that case the debate
that follows is not restricted te the amendment, but includes the motive of the amendment and of the motion, both matters being
under the consideration of the house as alternative propositions.
This authority is supported by precedents.
It is stated here that a naked negative, and
what is called an expanded negative, that is
a negative made more imposing by mere
verbiage, are not in order. But it is clearly
laid down that a motion can be defeated by
an amendment which strikes out all the
words except the word "That" and substitutes
other words, which may be wholly or partially
opposed to the proposition in the original
motion.
As I have said, it is of no consequence to
me whether the point of order is upheld, but
I think that so far as the House is concerned the matter is of such importance that
we should have a considered ruling-that we
should not in haste make a precedent which
we might be sorry for in the future.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Ask me a dozen. I
do not know that I will answer them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is it a fact that
the kernel, the gist, of the motion by the
honourable senator from Vancouver is that
Canada should withdraw from the League of
Nations?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: What has that to do
with the point of order? Can my honourable friend understand this English that 1
read?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable gentleman answer the question?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. Mr. TANNER: This book says distinctly that it is in order to wipe out the
kernel or to alter it. My honourable friend
may be a greater authority on parliamentary
procedure than Mr. May. If he is, he had
better write a book.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, what "colonel" is my honourable
friend attempting to wipe out?
It would not be in order for me to say
all that I should like to say on this subject.
The Senate has been misjudged. Some very
important bodies have concluded that the
Senate is in favour of our resigning from the
League of Nations. There is no ground what-

SENATE

ever for such a conclusion, of course, but to
pass any motion that does not express our
stand in an absolutely straight and clear
way would not improve the position of the
Senate in the public estimation. My humble
opinion is that the amendment, notwithstanding the judicious us<e of language by My
honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), is a mere negative to the motion.
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
senators, the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) lias moved the
following motion:
That this House is of the opinion that
Canada should withdraw from menbership in
the League of Nations, and that no further
money should be voted to the League.
In amendment to this motion, the honourable senator from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
has moved:
That all the words of the motion after the
first word "That," in line one, be struck out
and the following substituted therefor:censidering that several nations have withdrawn support from the League ef Nations,
the Senate of Canada, regretting the adverse
impression thus created, recognizing that the
League in nany of its activities has achieved
substantial and beneficial results. declares the
opinion that Canada should continue mienbership in the League and act in concert with
the United Kingdom and the sister Dominions;
and should exert its influence to bring about
such revision of the constitutional authority,
duty and procedure of the League as may be
advisable and be likely to enlist the co-operation of the Great Powers and other nations of

the world for maintenance of peace and betterment generally of world conditions.

The honourable senator from Parkdale bas
raised a point of order to the effect that the
words in the proposed amendment "hould
continue membership in the League" are a
direct negative to the motion that has been
under consideration for some weeks, and that
therefore the amendment is out of order.
I have perused May's Parliamentary PracMay, at page
tice and other authorities.
283, says:
Amendments that are merely an expanded
negative cannot be put froin the chair.
Peel's Decisions, page 9, says:
A mere negative cannot b moved as an
amxendument, and a proposed anendnent which
is merely an expanded negative is not in order.
In Denison and Brand's Decisions, page 9,
find the following:
Amendmxents in the nature of substantive
resolution and not of amendment to the resolution before the House cannot b moved.
In my opinion the amendment proposed
by the honourable senator from Pictou is
not only in the nature of a substantive
motion, but is an expanded negative to the
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

main motion, and cannot be moved. Therefore I rule that the point of order is well
taken.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to detain the House very
long. First may I express my appreciation of
the very kind way in which this unpopular
motion of mine bas been received bv honourable members of this Chamber. The debate
bas already proceeded considerably longer
than I anticipated it would when I introduced the motion. I can only say that I
hope the unanimity with which the motion
will be rejected will in later years prove to
be justified, and that my fears for the future
will not be realized.
In that connection,
however, I want to say to honourable senators tîat as yet I have not changed my
mind.
The one thing that bas been impressed on
me by this debate is the number of important
issues that are, so to speak, still left in the
air. The honourable leader on the other
state. that
side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
article 10 of the Loague's Covenant is not
effective so far as Canada is concerned; while
the rigbt honourable leader of the House
(Riglt Hon. Mr. Meighen) expresses strong
disapproval of a membership wbich doos not
entail the full obligations imposed by the
covenants. Many people in this country believe that when Great Britain is at war we
are necessarily at war. That leads to questions as to our opportunity and our obligation to participate in discussions concerning
commitments which bring about that, liability.
Large numbers of Canadians believe that
the Government should not decide to participate in any war unless it first submits the
question to the people by a referendum.
There is a strong feeling that the Administration should not be given a blank cheque
for war.
It is evident, honourable senators. that if
we are going to discuss effectively the great
external issues which confront Canada to-day,
some better plan of procedure must be
adopted in this honourable House. For once
I find I am in harmony with the Society of
the League of Nations in Canada when I
submit that we should have a Standing Conmittee of the Senate on External Affairs. If
next session such a committee is set up to
discuss these foreign issues I shall feel that
the debate has been well worth while.
The discussion this afternoon on the Sbipping Bill and the proposed change in our
mercantile marine flag emplhasizes the fact
that we have acquired a new national status.
Canada must assume the responsibility which

MAY 31, 1934
goes with that status, and provide the requisite
machinery to discharge her new obligations.
I had been warned that in initiating discussion on these four or five important external issues I was dealing with dynamite. I
prefer dynamite in the Senate to dynamite
in the country, where it is certain to be if
these issues are left to be immediately decided when tbe crisis is upon us. At the
present time I see no way of dealing with
these issues except as I have done in the
motion hefore the House. A Standing Committee on External Affairs would provide the
necessary avenue for consideration of these
matters. I repeat, if we are to discharge
intelligently our obligations under our new
national status we must provide the necessary
machinery to that end.
In conclusion, 1 wish to express my appreciation of the kindly references to myself
which honourable senators have seen fit to
make during the course of this debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. McRae was
negatived.
Hon. M.r. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, in view of the notoriety which this
debate bas brought to the Senate, I submit
there should be a recorded vote.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
I should like to
know under what rule my honourable friend
is making his submission after the vote has
been taken.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not sec anything in the rules requiring me to sit down
when I am suggesting we should have a
recorded vote.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
The honourable
gentleman is a rule unto himself.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator froma Parkdale asks for a recorded
vote. The rules require that five senators
support his request.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Three or four
distinguished senators on the other side asked
nme to make this request. I note that they
are not in their seats.

INQUIRIES BILL
SECOND READING

Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 84, an Act to amend
the Inquiries Act.
He said: This is an amnending rneasure to
enable the Governor in Council to empower
the members of an international tribunal to
do in Canada whatever by the present Inquiries Act the Governor in Council could
empower a Canadian tribunal to do. This
authority is to be exercised as a matter of
courtesy, for the benefit of governiments of
other countries which have, extended a similar
courtesy to Canada. It becomes necessary at
times, for tbe purpose of succe.ssion duties or
other matters connected with estates, to conduct an examination in a foreign country.
This Bill authorizes such an examination to
take place in Canada when the other country
concerned has extended to the Dominion a
similar courtesy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But thds envers
onîy international tribunal-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRAND: -- which desire
to examine witnesses in Canada. Under our
general practice a commission can be issued

152

SENATE

for the examination of witnesses in a civil
suit in any part of the world. The International Waterways Commission is the only
commission I can think of that might desire
to examine witnesses in Canada.
Has this proposal arisen out of a special
case, or is it general legislation, already upon
the statute books of the United States, for
instance?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It bas been
on the statute books of other countries, and
the power lias been exercised in those countries. There was a case, but I cannot give it
specifically. It was not one in which the
International Joint Commission, or Waterways Commission, was involved. It had to
do with estates. I do not know just how it
The honourable gentleman is quite
arose.
riglt that all that is intended or permitted
by this amendment is to empower an international tribunal to hold court in Canada if
a corresponding right has been given to hold
court in the other country. The powers that
may be given are exactly those authorized in
the present Inquiries Act. That is to say,
the Governor in Council cannot allow anything more to be donc than can be donc
under the present Act.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is it not a case
that bas to do with paying succession duties
twice?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. That is
just an illustration. If a government desired
to make certain inquiries here under oath, I
presume it could do so by the process of
court which my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) had in mind; but if the matter
were not in the courts it might be desirable
to appoint a commission here.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the purpose
is merely to give an international body power
to take evidence, I would offer no objection;
but I remember one occasion when, in my
innnocence, I got into a very awkward snarl
with people in Canada, the United States,
and Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That must have
been a long time ago.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The Board of
Railway Commissioners for Canada and the
corresponding body in the United States
recommended that we allow them to form a
joint board for the purpose of dealing with

that came to me were so strong, and seemed
so well founded, that I declined to proceed.
As a matter of fact, a gentleman from London
came here to point out the difficulties that
might arise, and urged that it might not be
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

beneficial to Canadian transportation bodies
to allow even an international body of that
kind to deal with rates in Canada. The matter
of long hauls and short hauls and all that sort
of thing came into the question.
Unless we are pretty careful in regard te
what ýthese international organizations can do,
they may get us into difficulty by dealing
with things that we are interested in and that
should be dealt with only by ourselves.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see that the
powers given under the Bill are somewhat
restricted.
h'lieGovernor in Council may. whenever he
leeins it expedient, confer ipou an international conniiîssion or tribunal al or any of
the powers conferred upon conmissioners
under the provisions of Part I of this Act.
Of course this would be done with the knowledge and consent of the Governor in Council,
and I do net see that very much harm can
come from giving power to the Governor in
Council to clothe an international commission or tribunal with the powers conferred
uîpon commissioners under the provisions of
Part I of this Act. It would be very excep-

tional, I should think.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Quite.

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
COMPANIES

BILL

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 64, an Act respecting
Dominion Companies.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, I wish to
move the second reading of this Bill now,
for the reason that it is an extensive measure
and I am quite sure it would be the desire
of the House to refer it to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. Possibly the bonourable senator from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain) may wish te have it referred
to Committee of the Whole, but I think it
would be more apt to receive at the hands
of the select committee the consideration
which we like to give such measures.
The measure is an important one, and quite
extensive in its modifications. It is a complete revision of the Companies Act and the
old Companies Clauses Act. The Bill was
prepared at the instance of a provincial conference held about a year and a half ago

JIJNE 5, 1934
and was submitted ta the provincial conference which met in January last. On this
occasion it was reviewed by a committee, consisting ai the Attorneys-Genieral and the
Deputy Attorncys-General af the provinces.
Then, on the recommendation af the rommittee, the conference decided that the Bill
should stand over for study by the variaus
provincial governments. They were ta submit by the lat ai March this year any amnendrnenta they wished ta be considered. They
have nat subniitted arnendnients, and I think
it may be concluded from. their omission ta
do sa that they have no objection ta the
Bill as such. I arn not certain that it can
be canrluded they desire as governmenta ta
faîl in with the provisions of the measure
and adjust their own leqislation along similar
lines. It can he stated, though. that British
Columbia and Nova Scotia have advised that
they propose ta continue issuing letters patent
in accordance with their previaus practice,
and Queber bas given notice that it intenda
ta continue ita practice ai issuing ta companies letters patent irorn the Crown. On
the whole I think the Bill was pretty satisiactory ta the representatives at the provincial conference in January.
In the old Conipanies Act, in which the
Conipanies Clauses Act was enibodied, the
firat part dealt wibh the creabion ai companies
and the issue of their stock, also with the
creatian ai companies which had no stock-ý
corporations existing for purposea other than
the making ai money. Under the present
Bill these are dealt with separately. The first
part of this measure treata entirely ai sbare
capital cotupanies. The second part has ta do
wi.th -corporations without share capital. The
third part cantains provisions aipplicable ta
companies created by special legislation, that
ia, campanies which get their charters by
statute, and determines under what general
law they shaîl live. This part is not of grest
importance, because no matter wbat may be
included in these ternis deal;ing withb casapanies created by special statute, the casapairies .may be redeased frorn the whole or any
part ai sucb ternis by the spe'cial statute itself.
The fourth part provides regulations for
British and foreign mining conipanýies. Parta
V and VI are general, beling applicable over
the whole fie'ld. Part VII merealy deals with
the bringiing into effeet of variaus partions
of the law.
The main purpose af this measure is the protection ai the public in relation ta company
launeching and operation. It must be kept
constan'tly in mind that the provinces as wedd
as the Dominion cani issue charters. This fact

toa burdensome the requirem entsa eppertaining

regulations are tao strict, applicanits for incorporation go ta the province where they can

ta, what they want. A similar situation

Delaware are the happy hunting graunds af
cornpany pronioters. But of course in the
Uniteýd States the sale of securities of ail
companies now cornes under the Art wkich
was recently put into effert.
In view ai the alternative for company
prornotars which bas always existed in
Canada, this Bill goes a considerable length
indeed. It goes very far in restricting the kind
of companies which can be formed, espeeiaily
in relation to no-par-value stock conipanies.
I beldeve t-here is a complote prohibition of the
issue of no-par-value stock.
Then there are extensive and exceedingly
virile restrictions with regard ta the sale ai
stock. The prospectus must contain not only
the truth but ahl the truth, and the purchaser
has a riglit ta cancel bis purchase within a
certain time unless it can be sbown that the
prospectus containing full details actually
reached him before his purchase was made.
Also, the liability af directors is very seriously
extended.
In the preparation of this proposed legislation, as well as in the collection af the old
law, great rare bas been exercised. During
the course of years. with this amendment and
that being made, the law geta ta a state where

study them carefully and hear such representations as nay be made. But I would impress
upon bonourable members that we are
probably not far fron the close of the session,
and, while we want to do our duty with
respect to the measure, we should do it as
expeditiously as possible. This is a large
Bill. In size it is not comparable to the
Shipping Bill, but it .is a good second in the
legislation of this session.
I intend to more for reference to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
after the motion for second reading is passed.
J may say that in the other House the Bill did
not go to a standing committee; no doubt because the standing committees there are very
busy on the Bank Act and many other Acts.
It went to Committee of the Whole, where it
was given some detailed ronsideration, and
I believe it was also considered by a special
committee which was not created by the
House, but altogether by one party in the
House. J du not know just how that came
about, but apparently the Bill was satisfactory
to the committee so created. I recite these
circumstances merely to indicate that although
the session is well on, it does seem to me
right that the Bill should go before the Banking and Commerce Committee of this House.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable members, some four or five years ago there was
initiated in this Chamber a Companies Bill
which emanated from the Department of the
Secretary of State. Mr. Thomas Mulvey, the
then UnderS&cretary of State, took the
responsibility of steering the Bill through our
Committee on Banking and Commerce, in
which committee considerable time was devoted to it. We had among us at that time
one who was highly qualified to watch every
movement for modification of company legislation, the late Senator Béique. During the
course of some weeks when the measure was
under consideration we heard interested parties from Toronto and Montreal, and I think
from as far as Winniýpeg. We thought at that
time that we had gone fairly far in drafting
stringent regulations for the incorporation
and control of companies, but it became apparent, more especially a.ter the crash of 1929,
that we might go still further in trying to
prevent fraudulent operations under the Companies Act.
'Tis new Bill is an important matter. As
the right honourable gentleman has stated,
we may make strong efforts to improve upon
company legislation, but they may be rendered ineffective if the provincial laws do not
keep pace with ours. I am hopeful that for
the good reputation of Canada and in the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

best interest of our economic life the provinces will endeavour to strengthen any weak
spots there may be in their legislation and
place it on a level with ours. A considerable
sum of money has been lost throughout the
country because of laxity of our laws, and I
feel that in this matter every province will
want to co-operate for the protection of its
own people.
As w shall not be able to devote to this
Bill as much time as we gave to the one before us a few years ago, it seems to me that
it would be advisable for Mr. Caban. the
Secretary of State, to appear before our Banking and Commerce Committee and explain
briefly the various changes now proposed. I
understand that ie has already given a most
illuminating expositiqi of the provisions. If
he is the author of them lie is of course the
person most familiar with their details. J
suggest to my right honourable friend that it
would be well. if possible, to have the Secretary of State present to tell us in wa.t respect
this Bill goes beyond the former one to which
I have referred. On that previous occasion
ire had thought of including in the Companies Act regulations for the trust companies
as well, but it was suggested that there would
probably be a special Act covering trust companies. Perhaps my right honourable friend
can tell me whether the present measure applies to trust cormpanies.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is
nothing within the scope of this Bill that
was not previously within the Companies Act
and the Companies Clauses Act. Special trust
company legislation would not be within the
scope of this measure.
In the main, this Bill bas been prepared by
the Secretary of Staýte. He has devoted a
tremendous amount of work to it, and has
applied particularly some features resulting
from his experience of the last four years, a
period which has been one of great difficulties for the Department and of greater
difficulties for stock companies. He bas expressed to me a willingness to appear before
the Senate committee. In his conversation
with me to-day, which was the first time I
had spoken to him on this subiect since the
conference, he referred to the Bill mentioned
by my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). I do not know just what that
Bill was, but I know the Secretary of State
did not like it. I am sure he will distinguish
it from this one. We may not like the present
measure so well, for I have already been advised that some honourable members desire to
amend certain features of it.

SEA-BORNE

DISCUSSION

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH- rose in accordance with tbe following notice:
That he will eall the attention of the Govemnment to the question of the defence of the seaborne trade of Canada, and will inquire of the
Government what steps it proposes to take to
provide adequately for the defence of the seaborne trade of Canada.
He said: Honourabie gentlemen, the House
bas recently eoncluded. its great work on the
Shipping Bill and on the new Admiralty
Bill. Members of the committee which deait
witb those two bis have had their attention
dimected par.ticularly to the wbole question of
shipping, to the antiquity of the law, to the
part whicb shipping bas played in the growth
and development of trade and commerce
tbroughout the worid, and to tbe law as it

4àà

affects the lives of men of ail sorts and conditions who go down to the sea in ships and
do business in great waters.
It is of special interest to the people of this
country to realize that we have now become
the fifth trading nation of the world, forming
part of an empire which, curiously enougb, is
virtually coinposed of islands. Everyone
knows that Britain is an island. Australia
and New ZeaI.and aiso are islands. It is not
so well recognized that Canada, except for ber
land-borne trade with the United States, is
ýalso an island. The Union of South Africa
bas practically no trade wjth any other part
of Africa, nearly ail her trade being seaborne. The trade of India with the mainland
to the north is negligible, and practically the
wbole *of ber trade is carrieýd by water. Consequently the lanes of traffiw upon the high
seas are a dominant factor in inter-Empire
trade, and, indeed, the trade of every part
of the British Empire with the rest of the
worid.
The security of these lanes of traffle and of
the merchandise which. is carr-ied upon them
becomes, the:n. a dominant factor in the lives
of the component parts of the Empire.
Sedurity is defined as the continuing assurance
that the lives and property of persons within
a nation shall be free from molestation, interference or destruction. There is no use in
transacting business and trade or engaging
in the manufacture or creation of values unless there is ultimate security in their maintenance and use. Security, then, should be
the prime consideration of governments.
Adam Smith, in discussing the Navigation
Acts in Great Britain some eighty or ninety
years ago, although he was a free trader,
supported the navigation laws, and in that
connection used the phrase that in the science
of government «defence is greater than
opulence," meaning thereby that the first consideration in the success of the if e of a
nation is that its trade and business ebouid
be secure. Without security there can be no
confidence, no tranquillity and no progress.
Within the past tbirty years the conditions
affecting security have in turn been affected
by modem inventions, principally by the contraction of timne and space by resson of swift
communication bath by telegraph and wireless,
and also by the greater speed of railway trains

and sbipping and air travel. We say then
that security has been affected by the contraction of time and space, bringing countriem
which once were remote from each other very
close together. Then there have been fluctuations in population, the depletion of mesources, the destruction of market and thA

456

SENATE

creation of new markets, and o.ther conditions
affecting security. There have also been overpopulation, the struggle for raw materials, and
so forth.
All this is of special significance to the component parts of the British Empire, for the
reason that we to-day hold the largest unsettled, open spaces throughout the world,
and have in our possession the greatest store
of untapped natural resources.
The security which our trade bas enjoyed in
the past has been guaranteed by the armed
strength of Great Britain.
The armed
strength of the British Empire is potential
rather than actual; but so far as Great
Britain is concerned, she is the core of the
defence of the Empire. If Great Britain
were to suffer a reverse in the first three
months of a great war, then the whole of the
Empire would be at the mercy of the conqueror. If she fails, failore is complete. Any
threat against Great Britain is a threat
against Canada.
Empire conferences in the past have dealt
with this question of defence, particularly of
the trade routes, and it bas been agreed that
Great Britain would assume the major portion
of the defence without much thought or very
much discussion, as if it were the operation
of some natural force, although the Dominions
would have to provide for local defence.
There are several things to be said about
îocal defence. First, local defence, as such,
cannot possibly win a war. It may serve
some useful purpose, provided we live up
ro our obligations. But I wish to show that
tee have failed even in that. So we are relying for the protection of the British Empire
upon Great Britain herself.
Now it becomes interesting to examine
what we have donc in the matter of naval
defence. The personnel of our navy is betIeen 800 and 1.000 of al] ranks-an excellent
lot of officers and men. We have, in the
matter of fortifications, two fortified harbours
-Esquimalt
and Halifax. The defence of
Esquimalt conists of two 9-2 guns left there
by the British when they pulled out in 1906.
The fortifications of Halifax are very similar.
There is a very limited supply of the materials
used in defence, such as mines, harbour lights,
searchlights and so forth. It may be observed
that the defences of our two fortified harbours
are just about sufficient to justify bombardment by an enemy-that and not much more.
They give no security, no refuge for our naval
vessels, if we had them.
The system of naval defence of our shipping
is based upon what is known as the theory of
the defence of the focus of trade. If you will
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

examine a map of the world you will find,
leading into the great harbours and ports, a
series of converging lines from all other ports.
It is considered that all we could hope to do,
with our limited naval forces, would be to
defend the focus of trade. On the Atlantic
Coast we have three foci of trade: one into
the St. Lawrence; another into Halifax; another into Saint John. On the Pacifie we
have the focus of trade which leads into the
south end of Vancouver Island, the one which
leads into the north of the Island, and the
one leading into Prince Rupert. The thcory
of the defence of the focus of trade is that
our warships shall be posted in that neighbourhood, and that as our merchant ships
converge, and thereby offer a better target
for the enemy, our vessels of war shall be
there to protect them.
It then becomes interesting to ascertain
just what ships we have for our own defence,
under the agreement that we have made. We
have two modern destroyers.
I may say
that a destroyer is the smallest type of warship. There are battleships, battle cruisers
and cruisers of various sizes, and in comparison a destroyer is very small. Our Canadian Navy possesses two modern destroyers
and two obsolete destroyers, that is, destroyers
twentv-two or twenty-three years old which
are being kept in commission as a result of
tinkering and repairing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Were these destroyers bought at the beginning of the War
in 1914 for purposes of protection?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: These two obsodestroyers were originally in the British
Navy, which presented them to us at a time
when I think the honourable senator from
Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) was Minister of
Marine. They were not new at that time.
Then we have three, four or five trawlers, very
lightly armed ships that may be used in
trawling for mines, and work of that kind.
That is the total naval strength of Canada,
and it is divided equally between the coasts,
one modern destroyer, one obsolete destroyer
and a couple of trawlers being on the Atlantic,
and a similar number of the same kinds of
vessels on the Pacifie.
The task of this naval force on the Atlantic
is to defend three foci of trade, namely those
leading into the St. Lawrence river, into
Halifax and into Saint John. It may be
asserted without fear of successful contradiction that the smallest enemy cruiser imaginable could put to flight or sink all these ships
of ours in half an hour. and thereafter tha

lete

JUNE 6, 1934
whole sea-borne trade of Canada on that
coast would be at the mercy of any hostile
fleet, which is to say that it would be wiped
out. The effect of that I shall deal with in
due course.
I have said that the use of the sea is a
fundamental condition to the existence of the
Empire and of the Empire's trade. I wil
Years

amplify that statement by quotîng some
figures to show the extent of our commerce
upon the high seas. These figures, which are
for the five years from 1928 to 1932, have
been prepared for me by the Bureau of
Statistics. They do not include our landborne trade, which is exclusively with the
United States.

I have analyzed that sea-horne trade a.nd
find very interesting figures showing the exports from Canada of agricultural, vegetable
and animal products. Our total sea-born,,
exports of these products alone, for the five
years in question, were as follows:

During the past four or five years there has
been a decline in the prices of these primary
products of our Canadian farms, and we are
familiar with the effect that the bass in value
has had upon the trade and business of Canada. I leave it to honourable membera to
imagine what would happen if by reason of a
bhockade we were depr'ved of the free use
of the sea and could no longer export these
goods, so that instead of merely losing on
account of the reduced prîces we should by
one felIn blow suifer a loas in trade Vo the
extent of the total value of the products.

much of this is engaged separately in ocean

from one-third Vo one-haîf of the total is plying on the high seas. That is enough to carry
a large proportion of our export trade and to
justify our dlaimi Vo being the fifth trading
nation of the worhd.
I ask honourable members what real protection is aiforded along our own coast lines
to this enormous trade by the present system
of merely local defence. And how much less
security and protection is there for the great
volume of trade that la carried upon the high
seas in every part of the world where no
Canadian defence whatever is provided?

Many people will say that the protection
of our sea-borne trade is flot a serious question after ail; that we can always rely upon
the British Navy. That was truc in the past.
During the seventy years of our history we
have relied for defence upon the British Navy,
but in the last five years the situation has
changed. Under the Statute of Westminster
we have taken on a new national status and
wve are making dlaims to independence. Our
position has been altcred in a legal sense, as
we have learned in dealing with the Shipping
Bill and the Courts of Admiralty Bill. But
it is assumed that by reason of our partnership in the British Empire we are in some
way entitled to the protection of the Britîshn
Navy.
In the second place, it is assumed that
because our exports are ne-cessary to Great
Britain, the British Navy will be moved to
protect our sea routes. There is no assurance of that at ýaIl. During the past five or
six years we have made the rather disconcerting discovery that the very things we produce and export are produced and exported
by several other countries. This morning the
papers contained a dispatch that France has
2,000,000 bushels of w-hent for export. We
k-now wheat is exported from the Argentine,
fromn Australia and from other countries.
Indeed, there is scarcely a thing we produce
and export which is not produced and exported by other countries. Consequently it
does not folhow at aIl that our exports are of
such value to Great Britain that the British
Navy will protect our overseas commerce.
But that la not the most serious side of the
question. We may rely upon the goodwill
of the British people both to protect us in
war and to boy our goods in peace. But I
arn going to suggest that as a matter of fact
the British Navy is no longer able to defend
our trade routes. By the Treaty of Washington and the eubsequent Treaty of London the

SENATE
British Navy was reduced from 70 to 50
cruisers, contrary to what was advisable in
the opinion of the best British naval officers.
Then since the period of retrenchment and
the great drive for disarmament in the maintenance of peace the British Navy has been
allowed to deteriorate, until to-day 40 per
cent of its cruiser strength is approaching
obsolescence; that is to say, the age of twenty
years. Many of the heavier ships are also
becoming old. It is interesting at the same
time to note that the oldest ship in the
Japanese Navy has not yet been in commission eight years.
The British Navy is turning to the use of
oil for fuel purposes. I spoke a moment ago
of the British Navy not being able to defend
us by reason of its present constitution. In
addition to that, the next war may be of
such a sort as to make it impossible for
Great Britain to undertake the protection
of our sea routes. It is estimated that to
keep the British mercantile marine supplied
with fuel oil might under certain circumstances necessitate the British Navy devoting
itself to this task alone. So I assert it is
quite reasonable to conceive that the British
Navy will be no longer able to protect our
trade routes. And our sea-borne trade, in
exports and imports, as I said a moment
ago, approximates to a value of a billion
dollars a year.
There are three courses open to us: in the
first place, to do nothing-a very simple
thing; second, to co-operate within the
Empire; third, to separate from the Empire
entirely. I am assuming that we have some
consideration for our self-respect, that we are
approaching manhood, and that, as I have
been told by many persons. if we are going
to put on the airs of a sovereign state we
ought to look these realities in the face. So
we are being forced to the place where we
must decide what we are going to do, whether
to separate entirely from the Empire, or to
seek some form of co-operation in defence.
J have made some examination of what the
situation would be with respect to either of
these alternatives. At present we have no
consular service and no navy. We are relying
upon the British Navy for defence. If anyone was in doubt about this, the discussions
which took place on the Shipping Bill have

brought out the point in bold relief. As will
be remembered, we had to drop the Shipping
Bill last session when it was pointed out to
u- that we had made provision for the use
of consular officers, the arrest and detention
of ships, the policing of the seas, and so forth,
and that after the Statute of Westminster we
had no more right to command the services
of the British Navy than we had to command
the servants of the Italian, French or any
other Government.
We got around the difficulty in this way.
The Bill which we passed the other day contained what are known as reciprocal clauses.
Provision is made that we put our diplomatie
and consular services and our navy at the
disposal of other parts of the Empire, and
they by similar legislation put their respective
navies at our disposal. I fancy that throughout Canada this will be known as a fifty-fifty
proposition, regardless of the fact that we
have no consular service, and that our navy
amounts to practically nothing.
This is well illustrated by a story I beard
recently of a man engaged in the sausage
business. He made sausages out of rabbits.
If was noted that a large number of horses
were taken into his factory, but none were
ever seen to come out. The authorities became interested, and he finally admitted that
be used a certain amount of horse meat in
bis rabbit sausages. When pressed to give
thef approximate quantities. he said, "About
fifty-fifty." When pressed more closely he
said that by fifty-fifty he meant one horse to
one rabbit.
The reciprocal clauses of our Shipping Bill
are in somewhat the same category. Ie are
putting our Canadian Navy at the disposal
of the other members of the Empire, but we
have practically no navy. We are also putting our consular and diplomatie services at
the disposal of the other members of the
Empire, yet we have neither of these services.
On the other hand, the British Government
maintains consular and diplomatie services at
an annual cost of between $7,000,000 and

$10.000.000.

I propose now to discuss the expenditure
by Great Britain on naval defence and to
compare it with the relative figures for the
other self-governing Dominions. These are
the comparative figures for 1931:

JUNE 6, 1934
For the fiscal year 1934-35 our appropriation
for defence is down to $12,926,864.
I analyze the statement in this way. The
Dominions, with five-ninths of the popul.ation,
one-third of the trade and one-ninth of the
tonnage, pay about one-eleventh for national
defence as compared with Great Britain's
expenditure.
Let me put it in another way-the cost of
naval defence, relative to total trade. Great
Britain pays 3.04 per cent; Australia, 1.06
per cent; New Zealand, 0-77 per cent; South
Africa, 0.043 per cent; Canada, -15 per cent.
While South Africa is at the bottom of the
list, it must be remembered that in its population of 7,500,000 are included about 5,000,000
native blacks. The white population is not
more than a couple of millions.
Another comparison of cost of naval defence
is to view it per head of population. On this
basis Great Britain pays for naval defence
$5.48; Australia, $1.32; New Zealand, $2.18;
South Africa, 21 cents; Canada, 21 cents. We
are at the foot of the list of the various British

459

countries with respect to our expenditure for
naval defence.
Let us consider now for a moment what our
position would be if we separated ourselves
wholly from the British Empire. We should
have to maintain consular and diplomatie
services. As everyone knows, we maintain
to-day but three Ministers abroad, in France,
the United States, and Japan. Those who
have studied the Shipping Bill and the
Admiralty Bill must have been impressed with
the necessity of consular officers throughout
the world. Since our trade goes all over the
globe, it follows bhat we must have the use
of a consular service. If we were to place ourselves on the saime footing as other nations of
the world, we should have to maintain a consular service and both land and sea defences.
I have had prepared by the Statistical Department this statement. It covers a dozen
nations whom I have selected as more or less
corresponding with us in national stature, that
is to say, in population, trade, tonnage and
the like.

JUNE 6, J934
A rough analysis of this statement shows
that Sweden, with 6,000,000 people, one-half
our trade, but slightly more tonnage, spends
almost double what we spend on defence.
Portugal, with 6,000,000 people, about oneninth our trade, and about one-seventh our
tonnage, spends $3,000,000 a year more than
we spend on defence.
Argentina, with 8,000,000 people, about twothirds our trade, and less thain one-quarter our
tonnage, spends more than six times what we
spend on defence.
Chile, with less than one-half our population, less than one-quarter our trade, and about
one-eighth our tonnage, spends $10,000,000
more than we do on defence.
From the foregoing I submit that if we
placed ourselves on the same basis as these
independent sovereign nations, we should be
obliged to spend on defence alone $80,000,000
a year, or from three to four times our present
annual expenditure under this head.
From these statements it is apparent that
Great Britain leads in expenditure for naval
defence. We all know that Great Britain is
one of the most heavily taxed countries in
the world. Our people pride themselves upon
their national status, but they refuse to discuss this matter at all. Many of them say
that Great Britain has to maintain a navy
anyhow and can easily afford to protect us
incidentally.
This attitude is fairly well illustrated by a
story which is told by a distinguished writer.
A man named Jones bas an office in the city
and lives in the suburbs. He maintains a
His
car to drive to and from business.
wife's brother, named Smith, lives a few
doors away, and every morning as Jones
drives out of his garage he finds Smith standing at the curb waiting to be driven into
town. When Jones starts for home in the
evening Smith is on hand to be driven home.
Sometimes Smith feels a little mean, but he
comforts himself with the reflection, "Well,
Jones has to maintain a car anyhow." Jones
gets a bit "fed up" with what he regards as
imposition on Smith's part, but he does not
like to say anything about it for fear of
provoking a family row. And so the matter
goes on.
Now, what do we think of this parallel?
For it is precisely our position in regard to

naval defence.
being worthy of your consideration. Honourable gentlemen are all familiar with the
American hotel man's creed, that the guest
is always right. Now, amongst the statesmen of the British Empire and her soldiers
and sailors of the highest rank it is an axiom
that the Dominions are always right. It is a
cardinal principle of British policy that there

461

must not be any quarrel with an overseas
Dominion. Honourable gentlemen will remember how Lord Dundonald was treated.
He committed the terrible offence of quarrelWhat

sight by the British Government. Since that
incident the principle has been evolved: the
There must
Dominions are always right.
never be any quarrel nor unpleasantness between a servant of the British Government
and any member of the administration of an
overseas Dominion if it can be possibly
avoided.
We are always supposed to be
right. But some day there will be a family
row, some day someone will have to say
something about it. I submit we are the
proper people to raise the discussion. If we
do not, we may find ourselves humiliated by
the injection into our affairs of just such a
question as this when our people are not
prepared to discuss it and are not informed
in the premises.
I have tried to make out a case. I have
pointed out our enormous trade overseas,
the greater part of which consists of agricultural products, and how vitally this country
would be affected if that trade were suddenly
interrupted. To be prepared for such a contingency, I am merely asking that we
substantially increase our naval strength. I
want to make it quite clear that I am not
suggesting that we contribute a dollar, a man,
or a ship to the British Navy. I am merely
saying that as a matter of self-respect and
common decency we should assume the obligations and duties that go with our increased
national status, and that we should build up
our naval strength in ships and men. That
is not a thing that can be done suddenly;
it must be planned, and is a matter of very
slow growth. You have to increase your
personnel, but you must not increase it faster
than your ships; and you must not increase
your ships faster than the personnel for them.
I am suggesting that we should have complete standardization with the other parts of
the Empire, so that in the end we should
have a standardized Empire fleet. As far as
we are concerned, we should be building up
our own naval defence, increasing our navy
to a point where it can afford some real
defence to our sea-borne trade generally, and
in particular can co-operate with the navies
of the other Dominions.
The land strength of the Empire can never
be exerted so long as there is the slightest
danger that the sea routes are not clear. The
military strength of the British Empire at
any time is merely potential; it does not
exist at all; and its variation from the

462

SENATE

potential to the actual is based fundamentally
upon the free use of the seas.
ln our discussion on admiralty law we
learned that the British Navy, in addition te
what it is doing for us, is doing a world
work in the matter of policing, hydrographie
work, the maintenance of sailors' rights, and
se forth.
I have tried to point out that we are in
an unsound position in relying upon the
British Navy for defence; that while we may
have been safe in relying upon its protection
for the last sixty or eventy years, we are
no longer in that position. The British Navy
is, as I have said, suffering from lack of
expenditure-the result of the treaty, and the
great disarmament drive that has been going
on. It is in a very bad way. Of course that
is being dealt with now by the building in
Great Britain of new ships.
That raises the question of the limitations
imposed by the London Treaty, which expires in 1936. First there was the Washington
Treaty, which limited the heavier ships; then
the London Treaty, which limited the lighter
ships. As a result we have what is known as
the 5-5-3 standard. Japan is giving notice
>f her intention to demand equality, and
anyone who gives the matter any thought
has no doubt that the, treaty will not be renewed in 1936. In addition te that, by the
coming into effect of the Statute of Westminster since the inauguration of the treaty,
we were "lumped in" with the British Empire.
We must assert ourselves in the future and
net be "lumped in" any more. So we are
driven not only by the necessities of the case,
but by the fact that in 1936 a situation will
arise which will make it imperative that something be done.
I have raised the question of our honour
and self-respect. Of course we, as a country,
have led a sheltered existence; we have been
under the protection of a great Empire so
long that our people positively dislike even
to think about such matters as I am discussing
to-day. One who does so is branded as an
alarmistf, a war monger or a trouble maker.
60 we stick our heads into the sand and avoid
seeing these things. But I am strongly of
the opinion that this matter now deserves the
attention of the Government, because it is
something that must be planned. I shall be
told that we are suffering from heavy taxes,
that we are heavily in debt, that our present
expenditures exceed our revenues, and that
therefore the time is not appropriate. That
is a perfectly absurd contention and is based
on the assumption that the naval defence of
our sea-borne trade is some sort of luxury,
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

a toy that we may buy to play with, if we
happen to have the money in hand, and that
we do not need if we have net the money. I
assert that this is a matter of such importance
that naval defence must be moved up on the
scale of the budget, even if other things go
short.
As I said a moment ago, defence ought to
be the first preoccupation of the Government
We have now become a nation, and as a
Canadian I very much object to being placed
in the position of associating myself with
claims for nationhood, claims expressing our
national dignity, legislation dealing with demands for recognition, and so forth, while we
are unwilling to pay the price. or, as the
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
'Murdock) said the other day, while we are
unwilling to pay the piper. Our acquiescence
in such a situation can only be described as
sponging upon people who are not as well off
as ourselves.
Our people seem to have an idea that we as
a nation, because of our exceptional virtues,
our greater civilization. our better manners and
so forth, are entitled to have an easitr time
than other nations. I find no assurance of
that in history. The road that lies before us
as a nation is no primrosec path of daliance.
We cannot hope for perpetual peace, progress
and prosperity.
No nation in historv. no
matter how obscure, has lived its life without
struggle and adversity. No nation has grown
to greatness and remained great without
struggle and sacrifice and adversity and war.
Show me a nation anywhere to-day, or anywhere in history, of whom this may not be
said.
How can we hope to escape what all other
nations have experienced?
Egypt, Persia,
Greece and Rome all fell when their rulers
and people, grown lazy and cowardly with
wealth and luxury, refused to look facts in
the face, refused to fight and die that the
nation might live. That is the verdict of
history. From it there is no escape.
If you would huild up on the northern
half of this continent a great and free nation,
I tel] you that you must be prepared to defend
what yen have created. You cannot do that
hy proxy; yo
cannot rely on others: you
must do it yourselves. You must be prepared
to adventure your lives and your fortunes, not
once, but many times. Yeu cannot stand still;
you must go forward; and if through craven
fear of being great, you listen to those who
deny history and preach the doctrines of
pacifism and non-resistance, or who believe, or
pretend to believe, that mankind to-day is

JUNE 6, 1934
flot what mankind was yesterday, then it is
only a miatter of time tili this fair heritage to
which we have suýcce eded, and which it is our
duty ta pass on ta those who corne after us,
will dissolve in ruin and disaster.
Han. RAOUL DANDURAND: Hon ourable
members of the Senate, we have heard a very
interesting statement regarding the defence
of Canada's sea-borne trade, and what it would
be if we had a real sense of aur dignity, or
relied upon aur own strength alone for the
de-fence af aur shores under our own sovereign
flag. May I eall my honourable friend's attention to the fact that the nations of the world
spend for their naval defence what they deemi
ta be necessary for their security. The honaurable gentleman would have us stand on aur
own feet and face the warld. To what levai
wauld he have us build, and against whom?
Let us look at aur nearest neighbour. Would
the honourahie gentleman suggast that we
should campete with aur friends ta the south?
Would hie have ius build, on bath the Atlantic
and the Pacifie, ta such a point that we cauld
feel sure of being able ta defend aur sea
routes? I arn quite certain the honoura:ble
gentleman will not answer in the affirmative.
He will dismiss the United States fromn the
scena.
Then I ask him ta laok across the Atlantic
Ocean. Since the incident of Scapa Flow we
have had na enemy ta fear on the Atlantic.
Why, then, shauld we taka the money of aur
peopla, under present conditions, for the purpose of building up a defence against an
imaginary enemy or an evantual oppanent?
There being nothing ta fear an the Atlantic,
and nothing ta the south, let us laok now
towards the Orient.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What abaut the
norih, the Hudson Bay?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Let us look ta
the Orient. My honourable friand bas spoken
of the treaties whicha will ex~pire in 1936. At
present Canada is at peace with the Orient,
and I cannat imagine any event which would
draw Canada into. a dispute with Japan or
China. While the wind which blows across
the Pacifie may at times seemn dangerous, if
there is an ounce of common sense in the
United States and Japan, war between those
two coun-tries is unthinkable. Japan is on
the other side of the Pacifie, and for hier
development looks toward Korea and Manchuria, and as far as the borders of Russia.
A few years ega, after the United States had
somewhat curtly or harshly declared that no
Japanese should hold tîtle ta real estate in
California, I remember hearing Japanese rapresentatives in Canada state that Japan had

been hoping ta join in Western civilization
and expecting ta be treated on a fair basis
and with the dignity due ta a sister nation,
but that if she was ta be dealt with as she
had been in that instance she might decide
ta alter lier policy, and instead of joining
wîth the West and rising ta its civilization she
might turn in the other direction and lead
the Orient. It seems ta me that Japan bas
now reached the point of saying ta the world,
"We will mmnd aur own affairs in the Orient,
and will turn aur back upan the West";
and lately she bas adopted the Monroe
doctrine in regard ta China.
I do flot know exactly what my hanourable
friend would like Canada ta do on the Pacifie.
I doubt very much whether he wauld stand
up to-day and declare that we must spend
money for the building of a navy ta defend
aur country. If he did, wauld anyane in this
Chamber support him? I remember "that
in 1911 the Laurier Government thought it
proper that we as Canadians should begin the
defenca of aur shores; and when that Governmant left office in the saine year there
were on the tables of the Department of
Defence, or whatevar departmnent it was that
had such matters in its charge, plans for the
building of ships ta defend bath our caasts.
That was a beginning. Three years later,
when Germany was at war with Great Britain
and the British Empire as a whala, and
German ships wera on the Pacifie, it was
feît that we should have done samathing, and
ships were bought. But I do not know on
exactly what pretext we could pracead now
ta the defence of our shores against the posaibility of war with Japan---since we are
mentioning naines. I cannat imagine such
a war.
My honaurable friand says we owe it ta
aur dignity to sponge no longer upon others
for the defenca of Canada. I first noticed
that expression in 1911, when it was uttared
by Sir Hugh Graham at a London function.
,Ha saiil that Canada was not doing ber share
in the defence of the British Empire, and
was sponging upon Great Britain. The same
expression *as used in Montreal in 1921 by
Lord Lee of Fareham, who had been sitting
at the naval conference in Washington. Ha
endeavaured ta show, by quoting the same
figures my honourable friand bas cîted, that
Canada was nlot doing its part; and it
occurred ta me at the time that I would
answer the noble Lord-in London, if passible-at the first opportunity that offered.
The occasion presented itself in March, 1926,
when I was invited by the. Canadian Club ta
a dinnar to be given in my honour. 1 must
apologize for quoting my own ramarks in

SENATE
answer to the accusation that Canada was
sponging upon others for protection. This
is what I said:
I beg leave to touch upon Canada's action
in the Imperial and international fields. J
desire to give you an insight of Canada's
nmentality on questions which we do not all
see from the same angle.
A few historical facts may easily explain
our present mental attitude. You all know
that in 1913 and 1914 preparations were going
on for the celebration in the United States
and Canada of our 100 years of peace. My
coiuntry iad enjoyed phenonienal prosperity
during the preceding 15 years. It was developing nagnificently. Jinnmigrants were flowing to
our shores by hundreds of thousands, and we
were then building a third transcontinental
railway. We had a very modierate taxationindirect. therefore unseen by the nany and
mnostly unfelt. We had no income tax and,
when we look backwards, we now realize that

federal income or levy was around 130 millions
of dollars, and our expenditure for defence 12
millions.
Our immigration
Then the war caime.
stopped. Two transcontinental railway systems
went bankrupt. and the Dominion fell heir to
them, with 100 million dollars deficit a yeiar.
Our tax levy went up fron 130 millions to 350
millions. and our expenditure for defence. war
debt service, and pensions jumped up fron 12
millions to 144 millions annually.
These figures stare us constantly in the face.
They may seem comiparatively small were we
to consider then in relation to the acciiiimulated wealth of centuries enjoyed by Great
Britain, but for a young country like Canada
the burden is a heavy one. We now know
what income tax is and so miany other new
taxes which impede our trade. raise our cost
of living, and hamper our developient.
A little further on I said:
Perhaps, after all, we are still among the
happiest people on earth, by comiparison, and
because we have courage and unbounded faith
in our future. But this formidable upheaval,
which bas so profoundly shaken our economistructure, makes us quite ehary in assuminig any
new obligation which would have for its effect,
sooner or later, the possibility of being compelled to return again to Europe.
Wlien we look at our pre-war expenditure
for defence or war-12 million dollars-which
lias grown to 144 millions, we become somewhat
impatient at comparisons which are made
between our present per capita expenditures
and that of other sister nations. The old adage
that "interest is the measure of men's actions"
is still the rule which governs mankind.
Rightly or wrongly, most Canadians have not
the feeling that they are threatened. They
consent to be taxed heavily for what they
conceive to be pressing needs, but-do not
forget it-they think in terms of peace.
When their Government asked His Majesty
the King to delegate a Canadian to sign a
treaty affecting Canada alone, at Washington,
a London newspaper made this amusing remark
for Canadian ears and eyes-anusing
"Canada wants to sign alone her treaties, but
she bas no army nor navy to defend them."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The writer was thinking as would a European
in terns of force. It never occurred to Canadians that a treaty needed an army behind it.
They have been free from fear. They have
never felt that they needed protection.
And I dare to repeat here most earnestly
that Canadians never have felt they needed
protection.
They rather believe that they have been a
protecting nation. Their history has created
that conviction in their mind. The confliets
of 1775, of 1812, of 1899, and again of 1914
were not of Canadian origin.
It has been well said that Canada is a
producer of security, not a consumer.
It was Professor Zimmerman of Oxford
who said that Canada was a producer of
security while Australia was a consumer of
security; that is, Canada needed no help,
but Australia needed the help of the British
Navy.
Never lias Canada raised a finger calling for
help.
Canadians dislike the coaxing, the
manoeivring. whliicli is constantly going on to
draw their country into larger defence expenditure when she has, financially speaking, through
lier last European adventure, water to her
lips.
You vill quite realize lier state of mind
when

she is told in the press, in somîe formî

or other, that she is sponging on others for
defence.
In 1921, when the Washington conference
was coming to an end, Lord Lee of Fareham
caie to Montreal and publicly urged Canada
to assume a share of imîperial naval defence.
The conference had already decided to make an
all-round reduction in arnanuents. If the occasion lad offered I would have made bold to
discuss with the noble lord the wisdom of his
returning to Washington to press for another
50 per cent of all-round reduction in order to
further lighten his burden. Other missionaries
on the sane errand have been heard.
When we are asked, in cold blood, to assume
tdefinite obligations, our reason directs our
judgnent. We are apt to be more responsive when, in times of stress, an appeal is made
to our sentiments.
Certain expressions are handed down from
decade to decade, from century -to century.
Such an expression is this: "We must defend
the flag." We must defend it against whom
and to what extent? Our flag is flown on
the sea, but we cannot defend it against
the might of first-class powers. There are
other small nations of six or ten millionsmy honourable friend has mentioned some of
them-which attend to the protection of their
own coast lines. Their geographical situation may justify their action. But who thinks
of attacking them? And when has our own
flag ever been insulted? Shall we build a
navy in order to fly our colours and to boast
that we intend to defend the flag?

JUNE 6, 1934
As I said in opening, we are at peace witb
our neighbours Vo the soutb and with the
whole of the outside world. I do not object
to Canada flying its own colours. As we have
put Canada on Vhe map, I have no objection
to putting Canada on our flag. But I refuse
to concur in any suggestion that because of
imaginary enernies on the Atlantic or the
Pacifie we should now start to, build up a
navy.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
I
senators,1 ad no intention of taking part in
this dehate, but after listening to the remarks of my honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) I t.hink it might be in order
for me to spcak hriefly. My honourable friend
states that Canada has no need of defence,
and be asks who is going Vo attack us. I
have neyer before spoken about the things
that I arn now going to refer to, because they
occurred during the Wer. We had no naval
defence of any kind whatsoever on either the
Atlantic or the Pacifie coast. Thanks Vo the
extraordinary intelligence of the British
Admiralty, our Government received advance
and accurate notice of whcn the huge German
submarine Deutschland left the other side,
the route it was Vo take and when it was to
arrive on this side. IV came not Vo Canada,
but to an American port, but later on German
U boats appeared off our Atlantic coast. I
bad the responsibility of being Minister of
Naval Affairs at that ime. A very large
Canadian ship was sunk at the entranoe Vo
Hlalifax harbour, and several of our fisbing
boats were attacked and sunk. We appealed
Vo, Great Britain Vo see if she could noV send
us some cruisers. The reply came back that
she was beavily engaged frorn a naval standpoint and that it was impossible for ber Vo
accede Vo our request. We attempted witb
our arnaller sbips, and also the vessels Hochelaga and Cartier, to drive away these German
submarines, but our arrned forces were noV
sufficient Vo enable us Vo do so. We theD
appealed Vo our neighbours Vo the soutb, and
they sent us a cruiser-an American cruiser,
bear in rnind-Vo guard our Canadian coast
during the Great War.
In view of the financial condition of our
country I arn not in favour of spending at this
ime one dollar~ more than we are spending in
naval defence, and I suppose every member
of tbis or the other House, and the people

4tià

generally, are of the same opinion. I ar n ot
one of those wbo are troubled with autonomy
fever. I ar n ot an autbority on constitutional
law. I do not like the terra "Commonwealth
of Nations" and I have always been of the
opinion that legally the status of Canada
within the Empire remains pretty much the
same as it was twenty-five or fifty years ago.
The honourable gentleman frorn De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) bas referred to the
appointment of a former Canadian Minister
as Minister Plenipotentiary to sign a treaty
with another country. But there was notbing
new . in that. If my memory is correct,
treaties were signed forty and fifty years ago
by Canadians, including the late Sir Charles
Tupper and the Hon. W. S. Fielding. Under
certain conditions we are allowed to sign
treaties Vo-day, but I do noV sec how tbat fact
gives us any ncw status or any extraordinary
privilege.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my bonourable friend to the
fact that for some years prior to the passing
of the Statute of Westminster the Canadian
Minister wbo was enapowered to sign a treaty
with a foreign country was given bis credentials jointly witb the British Ambassador
to that -country. At the time when Mr. Lapointe was de'lcgated alone to Wshington
there would have been no trouble wbatever
if Sir Auckland Geddes, the British Ambassador at Washington, had flot insisted that be
should be joicd in the credentials. Then and
there Canada decided that our Miniýster alone
wvas sufficient.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What harm would
have been done if he had joined in? It
would not have made the treaty any weaker.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quite sn. I
was familiar with that situation and knew
that our Minister signed alone. Great Britain
bas al'ways been willing to extend privileges
and freedorn to any of ber overseas Dominions. And I know that to-day treaties can
be signed 'by representatives of overseas Dominions alone.
To revert to conditions that existed during
the War, I may say that we received a cablegramn to provide immediately flying stations
at North Sydney and Dartmouth and equip
them with seaplanes and kite balloons. Canada had no flying force, no kite balloons and
no seaplanes. I am citing this instance cnerely

Hon. J. A. MeDONALD rose in accordance
with the following notice:
1
That he wl call the attention of the Senate
te the very unsatisfactory position of aviation
in Canada, and will inquire what steps the
Goverument is taking te improve the situation.
He said: Hono urable senators, I want first
of ail te pay my compliments te the efficiency
ef the Senate stenographers. I had not intended to proceed with this discussion to-day,
but this merning I found it would be necessary for me te be away next week and I decided te make my remarks without further
delay. Stenographers came te my office this
morning, and although I arn a very restless
and nervous dictator they did a fine job,
for which I thank themn most heartily. The
staff is a very efficient one. If some of the
other branches of Government service were
as competent, there would be less delay ini
getting out the work.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I listened yesterday with a great deal of attention te the
address of the honourable senator from, Edmenton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), and I agree
with him that Canada should as soon as

honourable senater from Aima (Hon. Mr.

SENATE

Ballantyne) when he said that as Minister
of Marine during the War he was a little
humiliated because he had to ask Uncle Sam
to send some planes and flying men to assist
in the defence of our Atlantic seaboard. I
think the British navy did considerable for
Uncle Sam in convoying American troops
across the ocean.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
That is a good point.

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McDONALD: In my opinion you
will always find Uncle Sam and John Bull
working together in any grcat crisis, and so
long as they do that, civilization will be safe.
Aftcr all, they come from the same stock.
At the present moment the British lion, instead of licking its wounds--and they are
many-is trying to restore peace in a troubled
world. I remember having read that an
eminent American once declared that with
the exception of the vicarious atonement, the
grcatest gift God had given humanity was
tho British Empire.
I believe that present conditions point to
our great need for developing aerial transportation and aviation in general. In my
remarks this afternoon I shall try to be frank
without giving offence to anyone. On the
19th of April I placed on the Order Paper
sixteen questions, which had been suggested
by commercial aeroplane companies operating
all over Canada. I cannot understand why
it took a month to have the answvers brought
down, for an auditor could have assembled the
same information in a couple of days. While
I was waiting for these answers I was receiving
letters and telegrams from different parts of
the country asking what was the cause of the
delay, and now I must say that the answcrs
are in most cases inadequate.
As I see aviation in Canada at present, it is
like a three-legged stool, or a triangle. We
have commercial aviation companies, flying
clubs and the Royal Air Force. I intend to
deal for the moment not with this last named
branch, which is a military arm, but with the
other two branches.
During the War Canadian aviators formed
part of one of the finest flying corps in the
world. After the War was over these mensome of whom had been injured, gassed, or
imprisoned in Germany-returned to Canada
to take up again the making of a livelihood.
Many of them, being unable to obtain their
former positions, and not finding dther suitable
employment, finally decided to take up flying,
being more familiar with this than with any
other kind of work. They formed commercial
aviation companies and succeeded in interestHon. Mr. McDONALD.

ing

many of their friends to the point of
investing in the stock of these companies.
These companies constituted what might be
called a workingman's flying force, since the
men who were actively engaged in the business
had no other mcans of livelihood.
I understand that in 1927 the Civil Aviation
Branch of the Department of National Defence, which had net much work to do, as
there were only five or six flying clubs in
Canada, importe.d from England the idea of
the social flying clubs. Some twenty or
twenty-five of these clubs were formed across
the country, I am told, their membership being
composed of very fine young men who could
afford to give part of their time to flying as
a sport.
I will now deal with the answers that were
given te my questions, which were asked
with a view te ascertaining whether and te
what extent the Government had given
assistance to the workingman's force-the
commercial
aviation
companies-and
the
social flying clubs. I have already said that
the answers were inadequate and unsatisfactory. My first question was:
1. W'hat assistance did the Government offer
commercial aeroplane operators, if any, in
1933?

The answer to this was:
Assistance

was given te the developmaent

of

civil aviation through the inspection of aircraft. the licensing of personnel, the enactment of air regilations for the safe conduct
of civil flying, the provision of air navigation
facilities, and training courses for commercial
pilots at Camp Borden.
All this work is done through the Civil
Aviation Branch of the Department of
National Defence, and it does net in any
way constitute assistance to the operators.
The enforcing of air regulations does not
help the commercial companies to carry on
flying any more than bighway regulations
help cartage companies to operate their
trucks. The answer means, in other words,
that the department assisted the companies
by passing certain laws, any infraction of
which was punishable.
My second question was:
2. What further assistance, if any, is
planned for commercial aeroplane operators in
1934?

Listen to the answer:

Yes. If financial

conditions permit, the Government will give
the same assistance as in 1933, which was
no assistance at all.
This is my third question:
3. What subsidy did the Government 'ive
the flying clubs in aeroplanes and cash in
1933?
Now this is the other leg of the stool, the
social flying club idea imported from the Old
Country.
The answer is:
The following assistance was rendered to
twenty-two approved flying clubs in the fiscal
year 1933-34:
(a) Grants to clubs in respect of members
for private pilots' certificates,
qualifying
$10,561.34.
(b) Grants to clubs in respect of members
qualifying for commercial pilots' certificates,
$2,789.80.
(c) Used aeroplanes issued from surplus
stocks of Department of National Defence, 9.
Honourable members will observe that the
Government gave cash subsidies to the flying
clubs amounting approximately to $13,350 and
issued to them a total of nine aeroplanes
"from surplus stocks." I do not comment on
the sentence; I merely call attention to it.
In question 4 I ask:
4. Has this subsidy been increased for 1934?
If so, why?
The answer is:
The agreements with the clubs have been
extended for the fiscal year end'ing March 31,
1935, on the same basis as assistance was
rendered in the previous fiscal year, with the
exception that the grant per flying bour made
on account of members of clubs qualifying for
commercial pilots' certificates bas been increased from $2 per hour limited to a maximum
of fifty hours, to $4 per hour limited to a
maximum of forty hours, per pilot. It was
considered that the grant of $2 per bour was
not sufficient to encourage a young pilot to
complete his training.
The Department of National Defence has
increased the subsidy to encourage the young
pilot to complete his training and obtain a
commercial licence. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that the department does

469

not grant a similar subsidy to encourage the
young pilot to take his training with a commercial company, nor does it give any consideration to the value of the commercial
licence. This prompts me to ask: How can
we expect to establish a reserve of young commercial pilots when the Government is giving
no direct assistance to the commercial companies?
My fifth question:
5. Do the commercial operators get the same
subsidy for the same work done as the flying
clubs? If not, why not?
This is the evasive answer:
No. It bas not been the policy of the
Government to subsidize commercial flying.
Surely if the Government is justified in
granting money to one group to accomplish
certain work, another group doing the same
work should be entitled to the same consideration. Presumably the Government appreciates the necessity for training pupils;
otherwise it would not assist the flying clubs
in this regard. In effect, the department is
encouraging flying clubs to compete with commercial operators.
Commercial aviation is
the backbone of the industry. Flying clubs
should not be allowed to compete with commercial enterprises. These clubs should be
reserved exclusively for sportsmen pilots.
Question 6:
6. Are airports in Canada being closed? If
so, why?
This is the answer:
There has been no general change in the
airport situation.
The number of airports
licensed on April 1, 1934, was 96. The number
of airports licensed on April 1, 1933, was 98.
Question 7:
7. Does the Government give any subsidy to
encourage the airport operators?
The answer is:
The provision of municipal airports is the
responsibility of the municipalities concerned,
and no special subsidies are given to airport
operators. One of the terms of the agreement
with the flying clubs is that they shall provide
a suitable airport and hangar accommodation.
Several municipalities have declined to
establish airports, and private interests have
provided the necessary accommodation.
Is
not commercial aviation of sufficient importance to Canada to justify assisting airports
so established? The answer suggests a further question: Does the department expect
the flying clubs to develop in our cities airports such as those which have been established in practically all the important cities
of the world? If so, it is an unreasonable

thusiasts could not undertake the heavy
financial outlay which would be necessary.

470

Question 8:
8. What is the Government doing to encourage the establishment of an inter-city passenger
service?
The department answers:
Inter-city passenger services are the business
of the operating companies. As the demand
for these services develops, and the financial
situation permits, consideration will be given
to assisting in the organization and development of the air routes and to the provision
and installation of the necessary aids to air
navigation.
Why not
Again the answer is evasive.
frankly say "nothing." I am informed that
in certain parts of this country there is a
definite demand for inter-city passenger service, and that some of the commercial operators are eager to proceed with its development, but cannot do so without first obtaining at least an assurance from the Government that assistance will be granted as soon
as business conditions permit. As yet no such
assurance has been given.
Question 9:
9. Has the Government any definite policy
as to the development of commercial aviation
in Canada? If so, what is it?
I ask honourable gentlemen to note the
answer:
See answer to No. 1. As regards commercial
operations in Northern Canada. these are selfsustaining, and the traffic shows a steady
increase.
Work is proceeding on the planning and
construction of the ground facilities necessary
for the operation of a Trans-Canada air mail
service under the program for the relief of
unemployment. The situation in regard to the
operation of this service, as and when financial
conditions permit, and its main truck connections, domestic and foreign, is being carefully
considered.
Why does not the Govenmment admit that
it has no definite policy for the development
of commercial aviation? The department is
badly informed when it states that the commercial operations in Northern Canada are
self-sustaining. I am advised that some of
the companies have been operating at a loss
and that one has had to cease operations. It
will be observed that the answer has no bearing on the question asked. The Government
does not state whether it has any policy or
not. It merely tells us of certain facilities
for a proposed Trans-Canada Air Mail Service. In my opinion, even if the Government
embarked immediately on a definite plan of
development, the service could not be in full
operation before 1937 or 1938.
Question 10:
10. Is it the policy of the Government to
operate air services in Canada as a Government undertaking, or is the Government
encouraging private enterprises along this line?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD.

The answer is pretty short and emphatic:
Answered by No. 9.
Question 11:
11. How much photography, mapping and
survey flying was done in 1930, 1931, 1932
and 1933 by the Royal Canadian Air Force,
and what was the cost of same?
The answer is fairly complete:

have been calculated on the basis of expenditure in the fiscal years 1932-33 and 1933-34.
Question 12:
12. Could this work have been carried out
by commercial operators? If so, why were
commercial operators not used?
Answer:
With the possible exception of some small
areas of vertical photography, the work could
not have been carried out by commercial
operators without duplicating facilities already
available in the Government Service.
The department in its answer to question
Il states that the work was donc by the Royal
Cansadian Air Force at a cost to the Governnicnt of approximately 8373,291, but does not
s-y whether this was military or civil work.
Surely the Air Force would not carry out
commercial work to such an extent, even with
some duplication. The Royal Canadian Air
Force should be maintained solely as a military unit, and should not participate in commercial operations. This expenditure would
have been of great assistance to commercial
operators, and it is my opinion that they
should have been encouraged to carry out the
work.
Question 13:
13. How mnuch air mail flying was carried

Question 14:
14. Would an independent committee made
up in part of active commercial operators be
of value to the country to investigate the
aviation industry as a whole in Canada and
bring in a recommendation to the Government?
This is the very indefinite answer:
Commercial operators are encouraged to put
forward suggestions at all times. These suggestions and other information are being compiled, consolidated and studied, in connection
with any action that may be taken having
regard to the funds available and to the
necessities of the situation as they develop.
Apparently the Civil Aviation Branch is
convinced that it knows all there is to know
of the conditions and problems of the commercial operators. The information I have
before me is to the contrary. In this instance,
too, the department does not answer the question. I suggest to honourable members that
much valuable information could be collected by a special committee of this House.
It could render the Government substantial
service in connection with the aviation industry by securing information from the men
who are actually carrying on commercial
operations and know what they are talking
about.
Question 15:
15. To what extent has the Royal Canadian
Corps of Signals taken over the radio service
previously maintained by commercial air transport firms in the Northwest Territories?
Answer:
The Royal Canadian Corps of Signals have
taken over no radio services or stations
previously maintained or operated by commercial air transport firms in the Northwest
Territories.
In March, 1932, the offer of The Dominion
Explorers Limited to sell to the Government
their equipment and apparatus at the following
radio stations was accepted: Burnside, Baker
Lake, Stony Rapids, Reliance and Hunter Bay.
Except at Baker Lake, which station is being
operated in co-operation with Revillon Frères,
these stations are not being operated. The
apparatus and equipment are being used to
supplement the equipment at Royal Canadian
Corps of Signais stations in the Northwest
Territories and the Yukon.
Question 16:
16. Are any extensions of this policy contemplated in the near future?
This is answered, no.
Now, honourable members, I purpose to
show how far Canada lags behind aIl other
countries in commercial aviation. Why is
Canada so apathetic toward its development?
Fifteen years ago we had the finest group of
flying men of any country in the world. By
intelligent use of the experienced aviators
then available we could have kept this coun-

471

try in the lead in the development of the air
industry. No such effort, however, was made,
and to-day Canada trails the world. Canadians, especially in the urban districts, do
not seem to realize the wonderful strides
being made in other countries, where the
aeroplane is in regular use as an everyday
means of transportation for mail, passengers
and express. They still seem to think that
aviation is a game for supermen engaged in
extraordinary tasks. We have been so busy
reading about and applauding the accomplishments of pilote of foreign countries that we
have neglected our own pilots and have done
little or nothing towards developing a national system of commercial aviation.
The following is a comparative summary
of activities in other countries and in Canada.
In England this year internal air services
have been inaugurated, at Croydon and Plymouth, connecting with the Spithead and
Shoreham air ferries, the Birmingham-CardiffDevon service, the Bristol-Cardiff air ferry,
the Heston-Ryde and the Liverpool to Dublin
services. Imperial Airways are now running
a regular daily service from London to Paris,
Brussels, Cologne, Basle and Zurich, and have
extended a regular weekly service from England to Calcutta, and to Cape Town in
Africa. The Indian service takes seven days
and the Cape Town service ten. The airport
at Croydon, during the month of July,
handled 11,603 air passengers, this number
representing a tremendous increase over the
same month in any other year. That is what
England bas done for commercial aviation.
France has recently, by agreement, amalgamated its four Government-subsidized companies inta one organization to be known as
The French Government has
"Air-France."
entered into an agreement with the new organization, whereby it will pay a direct subsidy
of approximately 86,000,000 a year for the next
fourteen years. The subsidy is to be paid
on a mileage basis. The lowest rate, 47 cents
a mile, is on the London to Paris service;
the highest rate, $1.87, is on the Natal-Santiago-Chile Line. Ail services are to be continued, and these extend to Africa, Spain,
South America, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey,
Belgium and Germany.
Russia, a country which many Canadians
consider beyond the pale, is wide awake to
the value of air transportation, and has extended its organized air mileage to a distance
of approximately 32,000 miles. During this
year a Trans-Siberian air route, covering a distance of 5,500 miles, has been put into operation. The Russians are flying this route daily,

472

SENATE

using 5-motor air-liners capable of carrying
36 passengers. We in Canada have not in
operation one aeroplane which compares in
any way with these large Russian air-liners.
In 1918, at the conclusion of the War, not
only was Italy practically bankrupt, but its
internal organizations and services were badly
disorganized; nevertheless in 1933 Italy, with
greater daring and confidence than had previously been shown by any country, sent out
the Balbo Armada, the success of which
astounded the world.
Even Australia has in operation certain
definite air routes, and during the past summer
imported a large multi-engined air-liner from
Great Britain. This year three new Australian services were opened up. Australia
also, during the past summer-and this will
please the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach)-purchased eighteen of
the latest type of British air fighters for the
Australian Air Force.
It may be hardly fair to compare Canada,
which has such a vast area, with England,
Germany, France or any of the smaller countries; but I think we should examine intimately into what has been donc for commercial aviation in the last few years by the
great country to the south of us. Shortly
after the War the United States Government
experimented with the first air-mail run, using
converted British war machines. The first run
covered a comparatively short distance and
carried only a few pounds of mail. To-day
the air transportation system in the United
States is the largest in the world in the matter
of revenue, route mileage and miles flown
per annum. During 1932 the air mail service
flew more than 40,000,000 miles, and upon
investigation by a Senate committee it was
found that the price paid for the transport
of air mail could be reduced by twenty-five
per cent. This is due to the fact that American companies have developed passenger
carrying to a very high degree.
In the spring of 1933 the principal operators
in the United States replaced their previous
equipment with new high-speed aircraft,
cruising at 145, 165 and 185 miles an heur;
but in spite of this they were unable to handle
the passenger traffic which automatically presented itself. Last summer United Air Lines
were running eleven return trips daily from
Chicago to New York, and reservations had
to be made well in advance. American Airways Incorporated, running from Chicago to
New York via Detroit and Buffalo, started in
May with one return trip per day, using fifteen
passenger 'planes. In the month of May last
they turned down $2,200 worth of passenger

business from Buffalo alone. During the summer they increased the frequency of the
service as rapidly as they could obtain aircraft, but have net at any time been in a
position to take care of the available volume
of business. The demand for air transportatien is so great in the United States at the
moment that to be sure of obtaining transportation a passenger has to make reservation in advance over the complete route which
he wishes to traverse, and in a great many
cases, even where a passenger is desirous of
travelling across the continent, the air transportation companies are unable to accommodate him.
Much of this development has come about
as a result of the excellent airport facilities
available in the United States. In the immediate vicinity of Toronto, apart from the
smaller centres, complete and up-to-date airports are available at Buffalo, Cleveland,
Detroit and Chicago. These are modern in
every respect and completely equipped with
lights, radio and weather forecasting facilities.
Chicago is handling thousands of passengers
every month; Cleveland bas averaged about
400 passengers a day, and Buffalo handled
1,500 air passengers in July last.
All the progress in aviation in other parts
of the world has been made possible by
Government support. Even Switzerland subsidized its air transportation operations last
year to the extent of 8150.000; and the airways in the United States frankly admit that
their development bas been built up and
made possible by the Government air-mail
subsidy.
Now we will leave that for the moment,
and take up the Canadian situation and see
how it compares with the others. A few years
ago the Dominion Government laid plans for
an air-mail service, and certain routes were
put into operation.
Mail was flown from
steamships at Rimouski to Montreal, from
Montreal to Toronto and from Toronto to
Detroit. Two international links were established in Eastern Canada, one from Montreal
to Albany and one from Toronto to Buffalo.
In the West large sums of money were
spent, and night flying was organized across
the prairies-from Winnipeg to Edmontonand an international link was put in from
Winnipeg to Pembina.
Mail was carried
by air from Edmonton to Aklavik, in the
far north. Certain mining centres received
their mail by air. During the winter seasonal
services were established on the north shore
of the St. Lawrence, from Moncton to the
Magdalen Islands, and from Leamington to
Pelee Island in Lake Erie. These air-mail

JUNE 7, 1934
routes formed a foundation for what was
hoped would be eventually a trans-Canada
air service. Commercial aviation companies
came into existence; airports and flying fields
were prepared in many towns and cities. The
number of commercial operators began to increase. Factories were built. Then suddenly,
as an economic measure, air-mail in Canada
was practically swept away, with the resultant
effect that the tremendous loss of revenue
forced all commercial operators to cut down
in every way and brought about the unemployment of many men skilled only in different branches of the operation of aircraft.
To-day, as a consequence, we have left only
an air-mail service to Aklavik, with a few
round trips per year, two short international
links, Winnipeg to Pembina, and Montreal
to Albany, a few air-mail services to certain
mining districts, and winter operations along
the north shore of the St. Lawrence River
and from Leamington to Pelee Island. I am
going into some detail in this matter, because
I want to place on record the situation as it
exists in Canada.
As a result, commercial operators have been
forced to explore every possible avenue for
additional flying revenue; and aeroplanes, in
the last few years particularly, have played
a most important part in the development of
one of the principal industries of Canada,
that of gold mining. New gold fields have
been opened up in certain areas across Canada from Quebec to Great Bear Lake, and
in every instance the aeroplane has been of
great service in their development. Our
statesmen tell us that the greatest backlog
to Canadian credit is gold; but without the
co-operation of the aeroplane and the skill
and efficiency of Ganadian pilots a number
of our present promising gold fields would not
have been discovered; in any event they
certainly would not have reached their present
state of development.
This work on the part of our commercial
aircraft operators is of tremendous value to
the Canadian nation as a whole. On numerous occasions, while carrying on air operations
in northern districts, they have rendered invaluable services to sick and injured people
who, without the aid of the aeroplane, would
have been able to reach medical assistance
only after days of bush travel; and in some
cases, had not the air pilot intervened, death
would have been the winner.
In the field of aviation Canada occupies
an exceptional position. It is a vast country
with populous urban centres widely separated,
and with heavy passenger travel between
these centres. Its people are genuinely interested in flying, as is proved by the success

473

attending air tours and air pageants held each
summer in many parts of the country. Canadians pride themselves on their high standard
of living, yet Canada alone among countries
of importance made practically no progress
in the development of aviation during 1933,
and it is the only country of moment whose
citizens have not at their disposal the privilege of travel over regularly scheduled air
routes. Practically all the flying that is done
in Canada is carried on in the remote areas
of its new north, where the aeroplane has
played an important role in exploration, in
mining development and in fire patrol.
In the populated parts of Canada no regular passenger air lines exist. There are no
inter-city services. Yet Canada is a country
of great distances. The aeroplane along with
many other advantages has, in particular,
speed to sell. This speed, together with comfort and cleanliness, is being purchased by
citizens in the United States and Europe in
greater quantities each year. People living
in those countries may fly practically anywhere at their convenience, in fast, comfortable aireraft. A resident of London, England,
may fly from London to India or to the uttermost limit of Africa; but anyone living in
Toronto to-day cannot fly even to Hamilton
on any regular air line, although both Toronto
and Hamilton have airports. What could be
donc here? A passenger service operating
froi Toronto and employing the latest type
of multi-motored aircraft could carry passengers. mail and express to Ottawa in an hour
and 20 minutes; to Montreal in 2 hours; to
Quebec City in 3 hours and 15* minutes; to
Windsor in 1 hour and 20 minutes; to Buffalo
in 20 minutes, and to New York in 2 hours.
Air mail from Toronto to the United States
via Buffalo would make air connections
through Buffalo to all parts of the United
States, and a letter leaving Toronto in the
afternoon would be in Miami the next day;
and from Miami, through the Pan-American
Air Service, could be delivered to any of the
principal cities in the West Indies or South
America. All this is feasible now with public
patronage and Government co-operation.
These developments will come, and the aeroplane will very soon play a greater and more
valuable part in the everyday life of the
Canadian people.
Nowhere else in the world are there two cities
of the size and importance of Toronto and
Montreal, separated by comparable distance,
which are not linked together by air service.
Canada is probably the only civilized country in which at the present time there is not
one modern, completely equipped passenger-

474

SENATE

carrying air-liner; yet Canada, perhaps more
than any other country, needs a network of
air lines. If a map were displayed, showing
the regular air routes of all countries, the only
large blank space among the civilized countries shown would be Canada. If Canada is
right in neglecting the development of air
transportation, the other countries are wrong,
even including the small country of Siam.
For the past few years several aviation companies in Canada have been carrying on
pioneer operations under great difficulties;
and when some definite plan of air development is evolved these companies should be
assured of a fair participation in the air
routes. The Federal Government has for some
time been preparing landing fields across Canada, and it is rumoured that a trans-Canada
mail and passenger service will materialize
in the near future. Rumour also has it that
this service will be operated by one company controlled by Imperial Airways of England. This is a rumour that is disturbing a
great many of our commercial air operators
in Canada to-day. It may be advisable to
carry on such a trans-Canada service under
one company; but that company should be a
Canadian organization. If it is not, certa'inly as many feeder lines as possible should
be made available to, and should be operated
by, Canadian companies in order that a monopoly might not be created.
Surely Canadians have sufficient brains and
initiative, and in spite of lack of encouragement they have sufficient experience, to carry
on any flying that is needed in Canada.
Canadians proved their ability and worth
some years ago, and at the end of the War,
it is said, sixty per cent of the pilots in the
Royal Air Force were from Canada.
Let the leaders of the Government and the
heads of Canadian industry get together and
launeh a progressive programme for the development of commercial aviation in Canada;
and let this be done in a sound, businesslike
way and not as a public ownership project or
-an adjunet of the Department of National Defence.
I hope that Canada in the near future may
assume ber proper place in the air.
I am sorry to have worried the House with
so much detail, but as letters and telegrams
have been sent to me and I have been
approached by men who are vitally interested
in this matter throughout the country, I
have thought it only fair to make this presentation as definite and clear as possible.

PRODUCTIVE WORK TO RELIEVE
UNEMPLOYMENT
INQUIRY

AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. E. MICHENER rose in accordance
with the folilowing notice:
That he will call the attention of the House
to the question of unenploynient and will
inquire what steps the Governient proposes
to take to provide adequately for work of a
productive character to relieve unenploynent
octcasioned by the mechanization of industry
and agriculture, and accentuated by the present
prolonged depression.
He said: Honourable senators, recently I
was diseussing with the Mayor of Winnipeg
unemployment conditions in his city. He said
to me: "Don't talk about unemployment. We
have heard enough about that. Talk about
employment." I am inclined to agree with
him. We must now think and work for employment.
The emiployment of the unemployed is the
most urgent question before Canada to-day.
It offers a challenge, as well as an opportunity to men of vision and courage to overcome the distressing situation in which hundreds of thousands of our people find themselves to-day. Is it not paradoxical that
Canada, with its millions of acres of virgin
soil and its untold wealth of natural resources,
affords to so many Canadians no opportunity
for employment?

JIJNE 12, 1934
Through tihe mechanization of industry and
agriculture, a condition has been ereated in
which tihere is employment for only a fraction of the nu-mber of people that were formerly at work. It is a period of readjuetment. It is douibtful if pirivate capital could
employ anything like the number of people
who need employment to-Jray. This condition
is accentuated by the -prolonged depression.
It would wppear to be the duty of the State
to provide productive labour for the people
until such time as a readjustment is completed.
I do nlot wisib to speak in any political
sense. The question of employment is nlot a
pohitical, it is a national question. It is not
necessary to inquire whether it is the duty of
the municipality or the province or the
Dominion to solve the problem; it is the duty
of ail to co-operate for this purpose. There is
no problem that cannot be solved. The Government of the day bas doiue mucli to encourage
the back-to-tlie-land ffnovement and has undertaken varinous public works to give relie£.
This, bowvever, bas been of a temporary character. If it is truc that private capital can no
longer employ the people -to a reasonable
extent, the-n it must become the duty of the
State to undertake sucli works of a productive
character as will give the people an opportunity to make a living for the.mselves an~d
th-eir famihies.
A great many Canadians to-day are discouraged, losing hope and faitb in themselves and in the country. Throughout the
Dominion, especially in the Western Provinces, the people are turning to radicalism;
they are advocating a radical change in our
form of government. I am told that in the
principal universities a large percentage of the
under-graduates are avowedly Socialist and
are well organized. Even professional men
express the view that if the present capitalistie
system fails to provide employment, then ahl
must work for the State. In other words,
tbey declare that if Capitalism fails much
longer to cope wîth depression we must rely
on Socialism for relief.
It seems to me that in national employment we bave reacb-ed a stage similar to that
in which a rapîctly trtavelling motorist finds
bimself when, lie enters a curve. If lie takes
bis foot off tbe accelerator, the sudden slowing down, with its resultant sidesway, tends
to throw the car into the ditch; but if he
accelerates, the increased, forward momentum
will hold the car to the road. We must take
active measures te accelerate employment, and
it is my desire to-day to suggest a few ways
in whicb. employment can be given to the
rnajority of those requiring work.

475

I hope a number of bonourable members
will express their views. We have more time
at our disposai than is available in another
place to diseuss such questions, and if we can
make suggestions which will lead the way to
better conditions we shall be doing a real
service to Canada.
If the problem of unemployment were
solved, most of our other troubles would be
at an end. I propose to mention four or five
constructive and productive ways of providing employment.
The first is that recommended by the
bonourable member for Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux). In his resolution he asked that a
part of the $50,000,000 to be granted for
public works this year should be devoted to
housing schemes in the larger centres of
population. He re.quested me to take this
subject up for him, as lie would be unable to
proceed with it. I, however, suggested that
I should prefer to broaden its scope to cover
a general discuission on the question of employment.
The National Construction Council's statement before the Macmillan Banking Commission was to the efféect that in 1933 there was
$66,000,000 worth of building done in Canada,
whereas from 1925 to 1930 there was an
average per year of $430,000,000. Last year
building construction in Canada amounted to
only 12 per cent of what it was in 1929.
Necessarily, therefore, a great many artisans
and people connected with the building
trades have been out of employment along
these lines for tbree or nearly four years.
At Easter time I had a capable contractor
do a few day's work at my home. H1e was a
thrifty Scotchman who had his home paid for,
as weil as another house, which he rented. H1e
told me that lie had hýad only a few days'
work during the hast tbree years, and was
heginning to hive upon bis capital. He did nlot
see mauch hope for the immediate future, and
was losing faith in~ bimself and in the country.
This example could be mu.ltiplied hundreds of
times over. As he still had enougli money to
keep himself and bis family, bis case was not
one of despair; but very many cases are
desperate, for there are to-day hundreds of
thousands on relief.
1 say again it is paradoxical that men should
be in such a position in a new and ricli
country. In my opinion those in authority
ouglit to be able to provide constructive work
to tide over periodis of depression or readjustment sucli aa tbe one through wbich we
are passing.
Hon. MT,. CASGRAIN: Doîng what kind of
work?

'11o

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MICHENER: Building homes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We cannot rent
those we already have, and I know it.
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: In Montreal and
Toronto, and, I believe, in Winnipeg, the
question of doing away with some of the
poorer districts and buiilding homes which
could be rented to the people at a reasonable
rate is being discussed. The building of these
homes would provide the people with productive employment which would enable them
to pay rent. In England, in the larger centres,
in place of the old-time slums we see real
homes. The Government there loaned the
municipalities money at a low rate of interest
in some cases; in other cases subsidies vere
granted.
If the honourable member from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Lemieux) had had an opportunity
to bring this subje ct before the House, he
would doubtiless have presented much more
impressive arguments than I can in favour of
the Government co-operating with the larger
municipalities to carry out the housing
scheme. What we need most, of course, is the
circulation of money. Once money starts to
circulate there will be an acceleration which
will give new life and hope and courage
to the people of the country.
As I do not wish to speak at too great
a length, and intend to refer to three ether
ways by which people can be employed, I
will not dwell further on this phase of employment, but will conclude by stating that
it would be a most reasonable way to employ
hundreds of thousands of men who have been
resting on their oars for more than thrce
years now.
The second suggestion I have to make is
that our highways be extended. The report
of our Tourist Committee shows that the
tourist trade of Canada at times Pas produced as much as $300.000,000 per year and
there is no reason why that figure should
not be increased.
Ontario, according to the
report, has 75 per cent of the tourist traffic
of Canada. This is occasioned not so much
by Ontario having so many ports of entry as
by the good highways that have been built
in that province. I do not know the condition of highways in the Maritimes, but in
Western Canada most of our highways are
of gravel, and in the summer-time become
very dusty. Americans from the centres of
population on the Pacific coast drive to
Vancouver over a paved highway. From
there they have nowhere to go; so they
return. If we had a good Canadian national
highway through the Rockies, via Banff and
Calgary to Coutts. which is a port of entry
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

into the United States, we could give American tourists a circuitous route through the
Rockies which would offer scenery and wild
life unsurpassed along any highway in
America. Road construction is a good method
of furnishing employment, and in my opinion
would pay returns in increased tourist traffic
as well as increased facilities to the people
of Canada.
The third suggestion I wish to make is
that the back-to-the-land movement be encouraged. During the last twenty-five years,
through the industrial development in our
larger centres, the country has been almost
depleted of young men, who were attracted
to the cities by the good wages paid and the
opportunities of city life. To-day there is
too large a proportion of our population in
the cities. Even in the best districts of
Ontario many homes have been deserted. The
land may have been bought by neighbours,
but there are not as many people on the
farms of the province as there were a gencration ago. A back-to-the-land movement is
one of Canada's needs, and if successfully
carried out would provide a source of employment to many. A few acres of land and
some cows and chickens will provide a man
with a comfortable living during such times as
these. Care should be taken in the selection
of those who are to receive government support, and they should be educated to the
work. I believe that a large state farm where
young fellows from the cities could be trained
would be beneficial. When I left Calgary
there were 10,500 people on relief. If the
younger people could be placed in some line
of industry, or on the farm, they would in
two or three years become good citizens instead of bums. One of the most unfortunate
features of the present situation is that it is
not making for that higher citizenship of
which this country is worthy; and until we
find employment for the unemployed, and
thus restore courage and confidence and
hope, we shall never have the type of citizens
we desire. Human life is far more valuable
than gold, and we must do everything we
can to preserve the citizenship of this country. The Government is giving some encouragement to the back-to-the-land movement, and as it offers another avenue of
escape from relief and unemployment in the
cities, the authorities would in my opinion
be justified in carrying on an active campaign to accelerate the movement.
The Government has given relief to a great
many people in the southern part of Saskatchewan, and some assistance, I believe,
in the southern part of Alberta and Manitoba.
We have had four successive years of drought.

JUNE 12, 1934
It is a vexed problem. Some suggest the
removal of the unfortunate people wbo in
good years settled upon lands which are now
almost arid.
Notwithstanding that southern Alberta is SQ
dry, when you go through the irrigated districts you see fine crops of alfalfa, sugar beet
and sweet clover, and the honey bees are
busily at work. Everything is prosperous in
those sections. I amn told by a distinguished
engineer, no less an authority than Mr.
Magratb, that large areas of southern Saskatchewan and southern Alberta could be redeemed *by irrigation. H1e stated that if, say,
ten million acres in the southern part of
Saskatchewan and Alberta were irrigated, we
could develop a kind of communal life and
a farmer could make a sure living on one
hundred acres. getting far better returns from
a piece of land of that size than it is now
possible for him to obtain from a couple of
sections. As conditions are at present, after
a farmer bas sowed a section or two hie does
not know wbether hie will get a fair yield,
or wbether hie will get practically notbing 9A
aIl and in consequence have to be fed by the
Government the following winter. 1 arn not
sure that this suggested irrigation scheme is
feasible, but I arn told it is by those who
should know. It is at least wortby of investigation.
My fourth suggestion. whicb in my opinion
would be the most productive of employment,
is that we sbould develop our natural resources. In England and other old countries
the natural resources are more or less depleted, but this is not so in Canada. It seems
to me that until sucb time as private capital
can develop those natural resources to the
point where they can supply our national
needs, the Goverament would be justified in
supplementing such development.
Alberta has been unsuccessful in its attempt
to interest the large industrial centres of eastern Ontario in lignite and bituminous coal,
and our Canadiani money continues to pour
across t.he border in payment for Pennsylvania anthracite. But along the foothls
of Alberta there are large reserves of hard
coal witb a fixed carbon content of around 80
per cent, which is said to be as good as the
Pennsylvania product. My honourable friend
from C'algary (Hon. Mr. Burns) and some
associates own a property on the Elbow river,
about fifty miles from Calgary, on wbich there
is enough bard coal to supply Ontario for a
generation. And alI that is necessary for the
opening up of that area is the construction of
a line of railway for about forty miles. My
honourable friend from Calgary himself had

started on the construction of that railway
before the depression began, but the undertaking was stopped at the request of the Provincial Government, who stated that a bard
coal mine would compete with the soft coal
industry of Alberta.
The market price of bard coal is such that
it secmns to me we could afford to pay the
freight rates on sbipments to the East and sefl
at a figure at least as low as that which is now
being paid to the Americans. Last year our
imports of coal totalled $32,000,000. A great
amount of work would be distributed arnongemployees on our railways and mines, not to
mention a large number of subsidiary businesses, if that sum were spent in Canada.
In view of the obvions benefits that would
accrue fTom such expenditure, it seems to me
that the Government would be j'istified in
giving some assistance towards the opening
up of those bard coal areas, and even towards
the making up of any deficiency in freigbit
receipts on bard coal. But I tbink that with
the prevailing prices there would be no sucli
deficiency.
A similar situation exists witb respect to
oil. At Ottawa we have a Geological Department. probably as good as any in the
world. We spend a considerable amount of
money on it and in return we receive some
very interesting reports. Tbese reports do
not indicate that tbe supply of oil stops at
tbe international boundary line, and tbere is
every reason to believe tbat large quantities
will be discovered in different parts of Canada. What would be more reasonable tban
that the department sbould appropriate a
sufficient sum of money to prospect and
locate some of these oil areas? A million
dollars, for example, would pay for a lot of
testings for an oil field. If two or tbree real
crude ýoil fields were produced, there would
he a great increase in the employment of
labour in connection with oil fields and subsidiary businesses. and millions of dollars of
new wealth would be created.
The argument' may be that private capital
bas flot found oil to any extent in Canada.
But it is my contention that tbe couintry
should not leave the development of its resources entirely to private capital. It may or
it may not be in the interest of private
capital to, develop oil fields in Canada, but
it is certainly in the interest of the country
that we should produce our own oil instead
of sending so many millions of dollars abroad.
Petroleum Oil Field was one of the first
sources of oul supply te be discovered on the
American Continent. It was discovered at
about the saine time that the Pennsylvania
fields were located; but from that time on

SENATE
Canada bas not made much progress in oil
development. The finding of oil fields, it
seems to me, offers a reasonable way in which
the Government could find employment for
another class of people, and at the same time
create millions of new wealth and save our
money going out of Canada. Last year we
sent $32,000,000 out of Canada for oil and
oil products.
Canada is fortunate in having also a large
mineral belt, which spreads from the Atlantic
to the Pacifie. Some very valuable gold mines
are now operating, but everyone believes that
so far we have only made a beginning with
respect to the vast wealth in the northern
part of our country. The output of gold
mines bas been one of the brightest features
that we have experienced during the depression. Because of that output and the ready
sale for it, millions of dollars have been
distributed among our people. The demand
for gold is very strong and it is altogether
unlikely that for some years to come there
will be any overproduction. I know of several
areas in British Columbia where development
has shown very rich deposits that have
assayed over $20 a ton in gold alone, not to
mention by-products. Because of lack of
capital the development has not proceeded
more rapidly.
I suggest that no-thing would do more to
re-establish Canada's credit abroad than the
increased production of gold, and I see no
reason why the Government should net give
some assistance to opening up promising areas
and thus helping to increase the gold output,
on which we base our eurrency. I know it
is said that private gold mining companies
will open up and develop any area that is
shown to be worth while. But why should all
work of this kind be left to large interests
that have already amassed great wealth from
our na-tural resources?
The question may be asked how the country can undertake national enterprises of these
different kinds to bring about employment for
a majority of our people who are now without an opportunity to work. In many large
cities vast municipal enterprises are managed,
not by the local legislative body, the council,
but by a board of commissioners. In the
present national emergency would it not be
feasible and reasonable for the municipalities,
the provinces and the Dominion to co-operate
in selecting from various parts of the country
capable business men to form a board of
commissioners whose duty it would be to
undertake as a national enterprise the providing of work, during this period of readjustment and depression, for those who are at
present unemployed?
Hon. Mr. MICHENER.

It may now be asked how such an undertaking could be financed. In reply I would
say that if there were a war and it became
necessary te defend Canada and the Empire
we should raise the money required. Surely
it is as imperative to raise money for reestablishing our people who in this period of
readjustment find themselves stranded and
without work. The Economic Conference at
London set twenty-five per cent gold as a basis
of sound money. I believe that at the present time Canada has more gold than is
necessary for her currency on that basis. If
she would issue currency on the surplus gold,
such a national undertaking could be financed.
For example, suppose that over the next three
years we were to take $25,000,000 of these
gold reserves and issue against it $100,000.000
of extra currency te pay for undertakings
specially planned and managed by a capable
board of commissioners for the purpose of
creating work. What would be the effect?
It is said that every dollar in money represents nine dollars in credit. So if we engaged
in an expenditure of 3100,000,000 for national
endeavour we should be building up throughout the country a credit of $1,000,000,000. The
result would be a revival and expansion of
business in every store and factory and in
trade generally, and our people would once
more be brought back to reasonable prosperity.

It

seems to me that under

present

conditions the Government would be perfectly
justified in circulating such a sum of money
with that object in view. And the co-operation of the Government in this respect would
give our people new hope, courage and faith.
We have had many commissions and special
committees, but so far there bas been no
attempt to get right down to business in dealing with the problem of employment. I believe that problem can be solved. I have
thought a lot about it, for it bas been on my
mind and heart for a considerable time, as I
have observed the condition of a great many
people who are without work and have no
means of living except that which they receive from the public treasury or organized
charity. I repeat my belief that the employment problem is capable of solution and I
feel that its solution would automatically solve
most of our other problems. If in the creation
of employment we followed these methods
which I have suggested, or other methods,
Canada could lead the countries of the world
back to normalcy.
The thoughts which I have expressed this
afternoon are a few of those that have come
te me while I have been considering this

JUNE 12, 1934
question of employment. It seems ta me,
honourable members, that wbat we need is
a proper vision of the situation. With high
courage and faith, if we work together, we
can provide the opportunity of emplayment
for ail aur people. In place of discauragement and lack of hope, we then, should have
courage and faith. And às more men were
employed in these varjous national undertakings additional currency would be cîrculated
amongst the people, our factories would again
became busy, business would be revivcd, and
Canada would once more be on the road ta
prosperity.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
May 1 ask the
bonourable gentleman what freight rate hie
figured on for the sbipment of coal from
near Calgary ta Toronto? Is hie aware that
nowhere an earth is coal transparted sucb a
long distance by rail?
Hon. Mr. MICHENER: I know that $7

that figure was unnecessarily padded. I am
also aware that a former Minister of Railways, the late Dr. Reid, wbo was a member

bis investigations bie feit $5 wauld be' ample

Hon. R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senatars, I have listened with interest ta the
suggestions of the honourable gentleman from
Red Deer (Hon. Mr. Michener) as ta schemes
that it might be possible ta undertake with
a view to bastening aur return ta prosperity.
0f aIl the- proposasis be men'tioned, I think
the stimulation of bouse building in the larger
centres is the mast worth wbile. If this were
put into effect it would belp ta eliminate
the slums fromn our cities and give much
needed work to, a gre-at many trades that
have suffered very badly in recent years. The
figures given by the, honourable gentleman,
showing that the value of construction
tbroughout Canada last year was only
M66,000,000 as compared with an annual
average of 8430,000,000 during the years 1925
ta 1930, indicate the effect of the depression
upan this industry. There is an aId saying
in Frencb-I suppose its equivalent is ta, be
found in every language-Quand le batiment
va, tout va; which I would translate freely
as meaning, "When construction moves, everytbîng moves." Any building scheme on a
fairly large scale would immediately have a
bene,4¶cial effect througbout the land. When
you put up a bouse you give work not only
tomcarpenters, plumbers and rmsons, but ta
miners, h1uibermen and employeeýs in many

479

kinds of factaries. It bas been said that
80 per cent of tbe money spent, an the average
building is for labour. And the use of
materials in construction increases the demand for aur natural produets.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You cannot rent
bouses when tbey are built.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my
honourable friend is in error. If building
were active many tbousands of people wbo
are now idie would receive cmployment, and
no doubt some of those Montreal apartments
that are at present vacant would be rented.
A period of normal construction makes for
the circulation of much money and gives a
buoyancy ta business in generaL
I remember that as a cbild I was sbocked,
as I suppose most cbildren are, by tbe statement that Nero liddled wbile Rame was
burning. I have since learned that at that
time most of the buildings in Rame were of
wood, and tbat for purposes of protection
tbere were fire stations and voluntary squads
of firc-figbters in variaus parts of the city.
If a conflagration destroycd a considerable
section, the rebuilding was done in brick or
stone, and it was the following of tbis policy
whicb made Rame what it was in the third
century. I arn nat suggesting tbe deliberate
biirning of any sections of Canadian cities,
but I believe that if tbe Almigbty were ta
toucb off some brimstone in tbe beart of
Montreal-I bave reference ta the section
fromn Bleury ta St. Denis streets, and up ta
Sberbrooke street-and clear out tbe centre
of the slum district tbere we might be able,
witbin flfty years, ta boast of a fine city. We
cannot make such a boast so long as there
exists that eyesore ta, wbicb I refer.
The bonourable gentleman proposes a backto-tbe-land movement. In the development
of a country dreams are converted inta reality,
which sametimes fails ta, bring about the
happy results expected. At about the time
wben the Canadian Pacific Railway was being
completed Sir Charles Tupper dreamed of
the day when 460 million bushels of wbeat
would be grown on aur prairies. He did not
faresee that other cauntries would becomne
immense granaries and thus make the production of wheat unprafitable for aur grawers.
One of the most urgent problems facing us
to-day is what we are ta, do with aur large
overproduction. A few months ago it was
stated at the International Institute of Agriculture in Rame that the total carry-aver of
wheat in aIl cauntries was eleven hundred
million bushels, ta, which would be added any
unconsumed surplus fromn this year's crap.

SENATE

That splendid dream of new wealth was not
fulfilled. Had we been able to see fifty yoars
into the future we might have worked along
other lines. No doubt the tens of thousands
of immigrants to whom we offered a quarter
of a section of land apioce would have been
very happy to receive title to twenty-five or
fifty acres, which they would have developed
as mixed farms in the same way as the farmers
of Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime ProvThose immigrants would

have been content to live off their farms,
instead of engaging in wheat farming exclusively. I may be told by honourable senators
from the West that there are millions of acres
in the Prairie Provinces which are suitable
only for wheat growing. I am not in a position to say whether that is the case or net,
for I have yet to hear any authoritative
opinion on the subject. However, as honourable members are aware, although we do our
best, conditions sometimes get beyond our
control and bring about results different from
those we had planned.
The back-to-the-land movement, I believe,
is one of the schernes we should try to
devxelop. It is already in operation in several
of the provinces, and the Federal Government is assisting in placing men on the land.
I would warn new-comers to revise their ideas
as to the profits to be made out of wheat
farming. I would advtise them to follow the
example set by the farmers in the old provinces. Let them rely on mixed farming, and
be content to bring up their families in modest
circumstances, happy in the thought that they
are masters of their land rather than factory
operatives in one of the great industrial
centres of the Dominion.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, there can he no question in
the mind of any honourable senator as te the
seriousness of unemployment in our country
and in the civilized world. It will remain a
challenging if not baffling problem over a
long period of time, notwithstanding that the
alleviation of the depression brings a measure
of relief. There is equally no doubt in anyone's mind that the honourable member from
Red Doer (Hon. Mr. Michener) is entirely
sincere. indeed anxious. in his endeavour to
mako some suggestions which may be helpful
to the Government in improving the situation.
But I fear I cannot follow him in any of
the proposals which he advances.
I ask
honourable members, and especially the honourable member from Red Deer, to keep this
in mind: the heart and centre of the world's
present difficulties is debt. We appreciate
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

this at once, and give assent, but just as
soon as we begin te think of something to
do in order to make work we forget all about
it and we begin one and all to proclaim some
idea whose very essence is an addition to this
burden of debt.
Let me run over the suggestions of the honourable senator from Red Deer. I accept with
becoming modesty the compliment inherent in
his speech: right at the base of it is the conviction that the Federal Government has unlimited means and unlimited credit. His first
suggestion is to remove slums and build homes
in their stead. Every step of thi; task is an
It is therefore
addition to national debt.
an aggravation of the central cause of the
whole world's affliction. It cannot be anything else. The honourable senator says the
municipal authorities in M\lontreal are thinking of slum remnoval, and that it has been
actually accomplished in Britain. There may
be something to be said for moving along
this line, by Government initiative, even
against the valid objection that it adds to
national debt, for it may be that in the end
there will be profit because of betterment of
public health by reoval of slum conditions;
but unle;s you can establish this it is
impossible to convince anyone who has been
close to the practical working of these things
that where the individual contractor. with his
plant idle and his credit unused, finds ho cannot build homes in slum districts and ront
them on a paying basis, it is novertheless
profitable for the Governmont to step in and
employ the contractor to build such homes.
Let us assume that the initiative of our
citizens is just as vigorous as it ever vas.
Then undoubtedly financial resources are at
thoir disposal if they feel there i; something
at band from which they can make a profit.
This being se, we know they would be building those homes if there was a profit to be
looked for. We know their plant is idle. We
know their credit is good. But they do not
build the homes. The only conclusion is, they
believe thoy would lose money. Does anyone
suggest tîat where private individuals cannot
make a profit the State by its better organization can do so? Could the State justify
such a program save on the ground that it
would promote some other public interest,
such as the public health?
Then the honourable member says: "Let
us be more active in a back-to-the-land
Let us take our unemployed,
movement.
buy a large tract of land somewhere in the
West, employ instructors to educate them,
classify them, specialize with them, and then
after a while we shall have good citizens."
My first observation is, this adds not only

JUNE 12, 1934
initially but permanently and increasingly to
the mountain of debt on the back of the
State-that debt which to-day not only
challenges but brings despair to the heart of
everybody trying to resolve the problems of
the hour.
Next, can we artificially add to rural
population? I know it bas been the ambition
of parties and politicians, and even of that
almost extinet class called statesmen, to add
to the number of our citizens in the country
growing grain and other farm products and
raising cattle. There bas been a tendency
to deplore the undoubted statistical fact that
the proportion of those on the land bas been
diminishing in relation to those in the cities
and towns. It seems to be thought that by
some system or policy or some special inducement you can reverse that trend and turn
Canada back into the old condition where
70 per cent of our population were rural and
30 per cent urban.
Let us inquire and sec whether this
assumption stands the test of analysis. Undoubtedly there are relatively fewer people
farming to-day in Canada than there were,
we will say, twenty-five years ago. But just
as undoubtedly there is a far larger volume
of farm products to-day than there was
twenty-five years ago. We cannot reason
from this that more people are needed on
the land, and certainly we cannot so reason
at a time when we are seriously addressing
ourselves to the task of curtailing the volume
of farm products.
What is the reason for the diminution of
our rural population as related to urban?
Again I come to the question of machinery.
Machinery bas made it possible on the farm,
just as it bas in the factory, for one man to
do the work of ten. I do not know whether
this agency bas been more potent beyond the
walls of cities or within those walls, but I
will assume it has been equally potent in
both spheres--that machinery has displaced as
much labour, in relation to the volume of
production, in the country as in the town.
If this were the whole truth, then there
would be no reason for any disturbance of
the proportion of rural as compared with
urban population.
If the operation of
machinery were alike in the country and in
the city-and we are presuming it is-then
the proportion would probably remain the
same. But though it is the truth, it is not
the whole truth. There is another enormous
factor which comes in-the ever-growing
volume and diversity of the needs of mankind. The part always played by the rural
population, and played to-day, is to supply
mankind with its food products of various
7472"1

481

kinds, and in no other function bas it yet
been able successfully to engage. The funetion of the city is to produce all other
needs of mankind; and this area of production is expanding away beyond the expansion
possible in the other area. We do not eat
more than we did twenty-five years ago,
but there are at least a third more things
we need to-day, things we buy and consume,
which were not available twenty-five years
ago. The inventions of these years have
added to the service of mankind a multiplicity
of productions our grandfathers and even our
fathers never thought of. Therefore the work
to be done in cities and towns in producing
these things in all their variety and diversity
grows at a wonderful pace, whereas the
volume of things which have to be produced
by the country remains virtually stationary.
This explains the fact that there is a continual diminution of the section of the people
on the land as compared with the section in
the urban centres. He indieed would be
optimistic who could look forward to any
early change in this tendency. It is probable that twenty-five or fifty years hence we
shall have a still lower proportion of our
people in the country as compared with those
who reside in our cities, because there will be
more work to do, more entertainment to be
provided, more services to be performed, by
those in urban areas. On the other hand, the
funetion of the country is not likely to extend
at all, and the gathering impact of machinery
will probably be the same in one section as
in the other. Are we in Canada going to
try seriously to reverse a movement which
seems to be as inevitable as the multiplication
table? We cannot do it; not to any appreciable extent. We cannot hope to improve
in that way conditions which the honourable
gentleman so much deplores.
His next thought is that the Government
should start to develop our mineral and oil
and coal resources, or, as he puts it more
euphoniously, the Government should cooperate and should stimulate and co-ordinate
the production of these resources. When one
descends f.rom the ethereal regions where
those charming words co-operation and stimulation and co-ordination are used, and takes
his footing on basic soil and seeks just
to do something actual, then realities have a
different appearance.
What, for example, is meant by co-operating
for the production of oil? The only method
I can think of would be to employ some engineers at the Government's expense to look
for oil. What is meant by co-operation for
the production of gold, or to stimulate the
production of this very much needed re-

source. of which there cannot be too much?
I presume it would be the employment of
our best geologists and mining prospectors at
Government expense, to search for gold.

THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We have been doing
that since Confederation.

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be.
But if we have, I should like to compare the
results of any communal efforts made along
that line with the results of the efforts of
men who have had the objectiv e of personal
gain as their incentiv-e to go out into far
regions in search for gold.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How is it
going to pay the Government to do what it
dors not pay the individual to do? What
pays the individual he is going to do.
Suppose the army of prospectors who to-day
are searching for gold were all organized
and placed under a very able superintendent
in the pay of the Government of Canada, and
it became their duty to search for gold and
get it faster than we have been getting it
until now. Does anyone imagine we should
succeed half as fast as we are succeeding now?
Why, the objective of those men would be to
continue their positions. They would not he
so eager to get gold as to get their pay at the
end of each month. They would have no
object in finding a rich vein; they would have
an object to serve by prolonging their occupations. In a word, should we subtract from
the verv incentives which have been the
cause of all the multiplication of wealth that
has come from the mines of this Dominion?
Looking back over the honourable senatnu's
suggestions one by one, I say they are all
an appeal for adding to the debt of this
Dominion and thereby aggravating the very
problem wr are trying to solve. Furthermore,
not only are they likely to fail to reach the
cery goal they seek; they are likely also to
impede that orderly and wholesome development w-hich. under the incentive of private
gain, is going ahead at this hour.

COMMITTEE ON TOURIST
AMENDLuIENT

OF

TRAFFIC

RULE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN mo-ed:
Tiat Rule 78 be amiended by adding thereto
the following:18. The Conmittee on Tourist Traffic. composed of not less cian nine nor more than
fifteen senators.
Honourable
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
senators, without in any way disparaging the
careful work of the Special Committee on
Tourist Traffic, I must say that I an unable
to grasp the real consistency or logic of making such a committee a standing committee
of the Senate. I have carefully gone over the
list of the seventeen commitees of the Senate,
and I do not find in it one which contemplates our going into the highways and byways for the purpose of engaging in, or
undertaking to engage in, a drumming up of
traffic for this, that, or the other particular
class of the community.
I realize that the question of tourist
traffic is important to Canada, and that what is
proposed contemplates the bringing of business

JUNE 13, 1934
to the railways, a better knowledge of things
Canadian to aliens in Canada, and additional
revenues through advertising and in other
ways to the press of Canada, and the making
of larger sales of gasoline for the benefit of
the gasoline companies in Canada. Incidentally, I have noticed that these companies are
doing a fairly good job just now by reducing
the price of gasoline three cents a gallon.
One of the reasons for this, I presume, is
that they might be called before a committee sitting in another place to explain how
much spread or gross profit there is in the
business. Another important reason is that
in some places general elections are now
pending.
The point I want to make is this. I think
the appointment of this committee is, in
principle, altogether wrong. If the Senate of
Canada is going to place upon its list of
committees a committee of this kind, I have
a large list of committees that might very
well be added. And may I say this? We
have one important committee, No. 12 on the
list, the Committee on Immigration and
Labour, which, I am told, has n.ot met for ten
years. My information may be incorrect.
Immigration and labour are clearly questions
for the mature and careful deliberation of the
Senate, or of any other law-making body in
Canada.
I think, although the special committee did
excellent work, it would be a mistake to
appoint a standing committee on Tourist
Traffic. What purpose would it serve? No
other purpose, in my judgment, than to give
to those that have. If the matter of tourist
traffic requires to be dealt with annually, why
not see to it that Committee No. 12 on the
list is enthused sufficiently to meet and do
business every year? Why not have a conmittee on Immigration, Tourist Traffic and
Labour? I am quite sure that if we had, the
persistence and enthusiasm of our honourable
and respected friend the senator from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Dennis), and others, would bring
about a meeting of the committee at least
once every session for the purpose of considering tourist traffic. After all, the tourist
traffic is really the immigration into Canada,
for a short period, of aliens who come here
to spend their money.
Personally, I think some further consideration should be given to this question of setting up a new committee of this House,
especially as an important one like the Committee on Immigration and Labour has not
met during the last ten years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I do not quite follow the conclusion
at which the honourable gentleman has, I
74728-31

483

fancy, too hastily arrived. And I do not
appreciate, as I usually do, the reasoning
which leads him to his conclusion. The importance of tourist traffic is of course admitted by him as by us all. Indeed this
House unanimously adopted the report of the
Special Committee on Tourist Traffic, which
report recommended the establishment of a
standing committee on the same subject. So
the decision of the House on the principle involved here has already been arrived at and
is a matter of record.
There is no reason why there should not
be a Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic,
or on any other subject, if there is a sufficient purpose to be served by such a committee. From the proceedings of the special
committee and the terms of its report it
would seem that there is a purpose to be
served. Certainly there is a large objective
in seeking to be of assistance to a governmental department, to attract attention to our
country and to help along a business that
in Canada aggregates hundreds of millions of
dollars annually.
The honourable member has conceived the
idea that the tourist business benefits but
a few, or, as he expresses it, those who have.
Even if that view were correct, I think it
would be no reason why we should decline
to assist in the extension of the trade, so
long as it does not unjustly affect those
who have not. Certainly it would be difficult to see how the tourist traffic could
possibly injure anyone, however humble, in
this Dominion. And on closer inspection, is
it found to be a business exclusively or even
predominatingly for those who have? I
assume the oil companies would benefit substantially by an extension of tourist traffic;
but tens of thousands of our people, the
majority of whom I fancy are of very
moderate means, would share in any benefits.
Besides, the oil companies are not all large.
There are a multitude of small independent
competitors who can bî relied upon to give
stiff enough competition to anyone engaged
in the industry and who certainly have done
so to date. Doubtless these small concerns are
the cause of the present reduction in price,
and at various times in the past have been
the cause of other reductions, some of which
have gone considerably farther than to invade
the profits derivable from the industry.
But the oil companies are not the only,
nor perhaps the principal, beneficiaries of
the tourist trade. Throughout this Dominion,
at every crossroad and along every highway,
there are innumerable little boarding houses
and tourist resorts. If any section of the

SENATE
people in our country are without exception
of the middle class--perhaps, in point of
wealth, below the middle class-they are the
proprietors of these very places. These are
the people who primarily benefit from the
tourist traffic, and who would look with most
faveur upon any governmental or parliamentary efforts towards its extension. I do
net for one moment doubt that the profits
accruing te them from such extension would
far outweigh those accruing to oil companies.
Indeed, all the merchandising interests,
small and great, would profit by any extension of tourist traffic. Small interests are
especially likely to gain, because tourists as a
rule are te be found not in big cities, but
rather in villages and resorts. Tourists deal,
in the main, with the small merchant. I do
net believe there is any other trade in our
country from which the humble individual
receives so large a proportion of the total
benefits. Surely the apprehensions of the
honourable member in this respect are due
to a conclusion arrived at too hastily.
It may be that newspapers reap some advantage from the tourist business. But net
all newspapers are large, or profitable for their
owners.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The bonourable gentleman says "No." He N more
fortunate than L, because bis newspaper is
still in existence. Mine have collapsed.
I think the bonouroble gentleman from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) will at least
agree that it is worth while to do something
towards the extension of tourist traffic.
There may be more force in the second phase
of his contention.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman a question? Can he
tell me of a single standing committee, out
of the seventeen listed in Rule 78, that presumes to deal with business other than that
which is before the lieuse?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the right
honourable gentleman name any such conmittee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What about
the Committee on Banking and Commerce, of
which the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) is Chairman? It
deals with matters of finance. And there is
the Committee on Commerce and Trade Relations, which has functions other than the mere
supervision of bills committed to it by this

conbitterly that that
He complains
mittee bas not met for some ten years. I
notice that the ninth name in the list of
members of that very committee is his own.
It should have been wi-thin his power to
arrange for meetings to be called, for I am sure
that any member of a committee eau do this.
Consequently I feel that the honourable
gentleman would have been fairer if he had
net directed the force of his criticism in this
matter against me and had appropriated at
least one-ninth of the blame to himself. I
am not a member of the committee.
Tourist traffic bas no relation te immigration. A tourist is net an immigrant, even for
the length of his stoay in our country, and
tourist traffie iN as distinct from immigration
as it is from divorce. And thougb nothing
is wholly separate from labour, tourist traffic
is as unrelated te it as anytbing con be. It N
as much a distinct matter for study and
inquiry as in any subject with respect to
which we have had standing committees for
years.
As I stated to the honourable gentleman
when be was good enough to speak to me
before making his remarks, I have confidence
that considerable good will result from the
work of this committee. I have this confidence chiefly because of the personnel of the
special committee, and emphatically because
of the honourable gentleman who was its
Chairman. He has already rendered a valuable service, and I know he will not rest upon
his laurels. After all, it is men, net organizations, who get results. It is the human unit
and not seme vague, shadowy entity which
is responsible for real achievement.
Hon. H. C. HOCKEN: Honourable senators, I am unable to follow the reasoning
of the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) in opposing the appointment of a Standing Committee on Tourist
Traffic. He stated that some standing committees of this House have net met for a
number of years. and in particular be men-

485

JUNE 13, 1934
tioned the Committee on Immigration and
Labour. I suspect that he is as much to
blame as any of us for that situation. I
would go so far as to say that the question of labour is of sufficient importance to
warrant its being dealt with by a standing
committee; but there can be no valid objection to the appointment of the standing
committee now proposed. A traffic which at
its peak produced a revenue of $309,000,000
a year, and with a potential return of
$500,000,000 a year, should be given our
closest attention. It is very desirable that
the Senate should continue to interest itself
in this matter. The appointment of the
Special Committee on Tourist Traffic and the
publication of its proceedings aroused a great
deal of interest all over the Dominion. Letters
commending its purpose were addressed to
the committee from every province. I have
no doubt that the formation of a tourist
bureau as recommended by the committee
would co-ordinate the efforts of the best
minds we have in the service upon the
development of tourist traffic.
I am not at all in accordi with the suggestion of the honourable senator from Parkdale that this work should be divided among
Immigration, Labour, Trade and Commerce,
and other departments. I think the necessities of the case are such that a particular
body should be appointed to study the possibilities and advantages of further developing
tourist traffic. Such a body could do much
more effective work than has been done so
far. To-day you will find men in the Department of Trade and Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and in other branches of
the 'Civil Service, carrying on publicity work
to attract tourist traffic. If you could consolidate their efforts in one bureau, and have
certain members of the Senate and the Commons study what can best be done, we should
very likely obtain much better results than
have been possible in the past.
The chairman of the special committee
(Hon. Mr. Dennis) devoted a great deal of
energy and ability to bringing out the information furnished to the committee. If
honourable senators will read the report and
the evidence upon which it is based, they
will, I think, come to the view that it is
very important that a standing committee
of the Senate should be appointed to carry
on the work. Canada is a country of wonderful tourist possibilities, and yet it is not
known to a very large proportion of the
120,000,000 people over the border-many of
them potential visitors. Surely there is important and profitable work to be done by a
standing committee to concentrate on the

objective set by the Tourist Traffic Committee. A revenue of $500,000,000 a year is
a reasonable objective. This revenue would
be derived, not from our natural resources,
but from the services rendered to visiting
tourists.
The honourable senator from Parkdale bas
referred to the oil companies. No doubt it
would be to the advantage of those companies to have a larger number of tourists
enter this country. But I do not know any
Canadian industry that employs a larger
number of mechanics and attendants. These
men are connected with the oil stations
located from one end of the country to the
other. The oil companies also employ a

for while no doubt its busines is very profitable, I repeat, in proportion to the scope of
its operations it employs a larger measure of
labour than any other industry in the country.
I urge honourable members to give the
most favourable consideration to the appointment of the proposed standing committee.

PREVOST

JULES
Hon.
(Translation): Hon. members of the Senate,
I trust that you will bear with me in the few
remarks I wish to make with reference to
Bill No. 4. I shall endeavour te be very
brief and diseuss the subject-matter with the
moderation and impartiality due to this hon.
House.
With an open mind and a genuine desire to
enlighten myself and form a just and sound
opinion, I read and closely examined this Bill,
the object of which is net only co-operation
but also centralization of all the translation
services of the Governrment and the Parliament of Canada, under the authority of a
Minister of the Crown.
After conscientiously studving this Bill, I
arrived at certain conclusions whicl I desire to
submit to this Chamber in plain words and
without any effort at oratory, but by going
straight to the point.
After examining fixe Bill from all angles I
note, first, that this measure deprives the
Senate and the House of Commnons of prerogstives and rights wbich thev have always
possessed as regards the control and supervision of their emplovees and service.
This measure, te my mind, has net been nor
is it yet justified by sound and convincing
arguments, especially on grounds of economy
and increased efficiency. It was contended,
with reference te economy, that a considerable saving could be realized by this reform. An amount of $200,000 was mentioned;
however, no calculation was made, no statement or proof was furnisled in support of
such an assertion.
Two hundred thousand
dollars is a very considerable saving! However, I repeat, the contention is net based
on any calculation placed before us. From
every viewpoint, we also are entitled te find
out whether this reform will furnish a better
translation service. We have reasons te doubt
if; we equally have reasons to think that the
efficiency of that service will not be improved.
No arguments were set forth to assure us of
any improvement in the various translation
services and particularly that of the Senate.
The Secretary of State himself acknowledges
that the proposed reform will cause anomalies
in the service of the Senate, and he was
disposed to make some concessions after a
meeting beld by our Internal Economy Committee. However, these concessions are simply
RiLht Hoit. Mr. MEIGHEN.

marginal notes-I emphasize the words-to
the Bill. In fact, an interview took place
between the Secretary of State, the Chairman
of our Internal Economy Committee and the
Clerk of this House, and in a report submitted to us the Clerk informs us:
The Minister agreed that the Clerk of
French Minutes of the Senate would not come
under the provisions of the Bill. He said that
lie would be prepared to assign to the Senate
for the duration of a session, inclding two *or
three weeks before Parliament assembled, and
for such further period after prorogation as
iay be necessary, the two translators at
present enployed by the Senate. When the
work of the Senate was concluded, holidays
for one or two niontis would be granted. If
at the expiration of those bolidays the Senate
have no work for those offici.als they would
as the
revert to the pool until such tie
Senate may require then.
It is the intention of the Minister to form
a sub-pool conposed of the law translators of
the two Houses, with offices in these buildings
in the offices whiich they now
-probably
occupy. Those translators would be paid by
beoine members of the staff of fie
and
Secretary of State. Each translator would be

translators wtould be under the control of the
Minister and the provisions of the Civil
Service Act. This would deprive the translators of privileges they now have under
clauses 61 and 62 of the Civil Service Acta privilege to earn and receive during recess
pay for services rendered.
'li tieme will cone wlen the Goverenient
will restore to the Civil Service the deductions
in salary and the statutory increases. Wlien
that tine comies consideration would be given
to those enployees who, under the provisions
of this Bill, lad given up certain rights to
additional renuneration.
No steps would be taken to put into force
any provisions affecting the Senate without
full and complete consultation by the Minister
with the Clerk of the Senate, and if any
points arise upon which they do net agree the
questions in dispute would be referred to the
Prime Minister and the Speaker of the
Senate.
Under thxese conditions J am satisfied that
the work of the Senate would not be impeded,
and I am confident that there will be a
imaterial improvement in the translation of the
Senate Debates.
That is the report, dated June 7, of the
interview between the Secretary of State, the
Chairman of our Committee and the Clerk
of the Senate.
The following is a letter, dated June 8,
addressed by the Secretary of State to the
Hon. Senator Sharpe, Chairman of our
Internal Economy Committee:
My Dear Senator,I understand that the purport of ny stateand Mr.
ments in ny interview with yo
Blount, Clerk of the Senate, was as follows:
1. The Secretary of State will not ask that
the Clerk of French Minutes of the Senate
be transferred to the Bureau of Translations,

JUNE Il, 1934
except with the consent of the Speaker of the
Senate and of the Clerk of the Senate.
2. The Bureau for Translations will take over
all other Senate employees who are engaged
in translating Senate bills and Senate debates,
at their present salaries.
3. The Bureau for Translations, under the
direction of the Secretary of State, will provide translators, before, during and after each
session of Parliament, for the translation of
the Senate bills and debates, and will become
responsible to the Speaker and Clerk of the
Senate therefor, and will provide for such
translators convenient quarters in the Parliament Building.
4. A branch of the Bureau for Translations
will be organized, to consist of the law translators of both Houses, who will be located at
convenient offices in the Parliament Building
and who will be especially assigned for the
law translation work of both Houses and for
the law translation work of the Government
when they are not otherwise employed in the
work of either House.
5. The translators will not be transferred to
the Translation Bureau during the present
session of Parliament. When so transferred,
they will be subject to the provisions of the
Civil Service Act, but sections 61 and 62 will
no longer apply to those employees who are so
transferred.
6. The translators who are se transferred to
the Bureau for Translations will be placed on
the same footing as other officials and
employees in the Civil Service of Canada in
respect of deductions in salary, restoration of
deductions, statutory increases in salary and
the like.
7. The officials and employees of the Translation Bureau, who are assigned to the work
of the Senate, will be instructed to co-operate
fully with and act under the instructions of
the Speaker and the Clerk of the Senate in
all matters relating to the legislation, debates
and other proceedings of the Senate, and a
breach of such instructions by them or any
of them will be deemed misconduct and breach
of duty on the part of them or any of them.
8. The Secretary of State, as the Minister
who is responsible for the administration of
the Translation Bureau Act, will co-operate
with the Speaker and Clerk of the Senate
in procuring and maintaining an efficient,
expeditious and otherwise satisfactory service
of translations for the Senate.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) C. H. Cahan,
Secretary of State.
These concessions, naturally, are better than
nothing. However, they seem slight and, as
they are not embodied in the Bill itself, we
have no assurance that they will be adhered
to. The Secretary of State of to-day may
not be in office later on-he may be replaced
by another Minister. The concessions which
his letter conveys are not only slight: we
already find some dissimilarity between the
pledge signed by the Minister and that
submitted to us in the report of the Clerk
of the Senate.
For instance the report
states:

When the work of the Senate was concluded,
holidays for one or two months would be
granted.
That is the report of June 7. In the letter
of the Minister, dated the following day,
nothing is to be found in this connection.
Further on, in the report of the interview
with the Minister, it is stated:
The time will come when the Government
will restore to the Civil Service the deductions
in salary and the statutory increases. When
that time comes consideration would be given
to those employees who, under the provisions
of this Bill, had given up certain rights, to
additional remuhieration.
This concession which appears in the report
of June 7, and which we are led to expect,
is not confirmed in the letter dated the 8th
of June.
We note another dissimilarity in reading
the report:
No steps would be taken to put into force
any provisions affecting the Senate, without
full and complete consultation by the Minister
with the Clerk of the Senate, and if any
points arise on which they do not agree the
questions in dispute would be referred to the
Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Senate.
Nothing of the kind is mentioned in the
Minister's letter. This leads us to state that
the slight concessions which were made to
the Senate, as marginal notes to the Bill, are
very uncertain.
With reference to the question of efficiency
of the service-because I do not wish to
wander away from that point-a statement was
made to the Internal Economy Committee
by the most competent person on the subject,
namely the Clerk of the Senate. His statement is as follows:
I do not think it is practicable te have
the French version of addresses, bills and
resolutions prepared by the pool
-as the Bill suggests.
Officers whose duty it should 'be to do work
of that nature should be available at all hours.
Their work would not be a question of translation, but a question of preparing originals.
An Address in French, or a Bill in French, is
just as much an original as the English copyboth are originals. A French-speaking member
may desire to place a Resolution on the Order
Paper, and it is his privilege to draft that
Resolution in French-it is an original-and in
due course when the measure is up for consideration, the vote would in all likelihood be
taken upon the English version-equally an
original.
He continues:
If the Bill passes in its present form, the
Senate will be deprived of the services of any
person who could act as interpreter before
auy cf its committees, especially the Divorce
Committee, where it frequently occurs that a

SENATE
French-speaking witness will begin his testimony
in English and, on account of temperanient.
is unable to proceed.
Under the present
system an interpreter is immediately available
-under
the proposed scheme the conmmittee
wvould have to adjourn until an interpreter
could be obtained froua the pool. A thoroughly
competent officer should at all times be available to render a translation of any subject
before the Senate.
Another feature is in connection with the
Law Branch. Competent law translators are
scarce. Every day of a session the Senate
requires the services of officers thoroughly
conversant in the two languages. Messages with
respect to Bills must be prepared in both
languages for transmission CWthe House of
Conunons. and for Returns and Addresses to
the Under-Secretary of State. Also amendments made to Bills are engrossed in French
and English. All these are original documents
and in no manner or form can they be termed
translations," as is the case in the debates
and bluebooks.
I
therefore conclude, as regards the
efficiency of the whole system, that it is net
shown that the reforms projected will improve
the present situation. And with reference to
the Senate, we have every reason to believe
that far from offering a prospect of improvement, the new system will mean a step backward.
After closely perusing the Bill, I have corne
te the conclusion that this measure bas net
been sufficiently threshed out and was decided
upon without a thorough investigation of the
present system which it is desired to change.
This Bill cannot be the result or the findings
of a serions inquiry into the question.
The proposed measure establishes a system
whieh bas already been condemned after
two investigations in Canada. Not only have
we no proof that this scheme will be perfect,
but, on two different occasions, commissions
which held investigations came to the conclusion that this system was not desirable in
Canada.
In 1910 centralization had existed for
seventy ycars. Owing to the disadvantage of
the system, Mr. Achille Frechette, a retired
translater. was requested by the Board of
Internal Economy of the House of Commons
to cross over and study the translation
organization in Belgium and Switzerland, both
bilingual countrirs. What was the outcome?
What conclusion does he arrive at in his
report presented in September 1910? After
having pointed ont that translation is not
centralized in Belgium or in Switzerland, Mr.
Frechette comments as follows on our system
of centralization which then existed:
The present system, established sone seventy
years aro. may bave ansmered the needs of the
timie. when the publie documents were very far
fron being as voluninous, as numerous and as
Hon. Mr. PREVOST,

specialized as they are to-day, and when the
greater part of them, being already in French,
had not to go through the French office. But
now that the publications of the public service
deal with so nany activities unknown to the
primitive country that we were then; now that
all the hunian interests, more and more
specialized, find their expressýion in the papers
presented to the Canadian Parlianent, a
centralized translation office can no longer do
justice to so mauch
vork that calls for
specialists. The experience I have acquired
during thirty-,six years of service in the
Commons bas convinced me that in centralization rests the vice of ouir systen.
Mr. Frechette concludes by making the following suggestions:
Therefore, and froum my observations in
Belgium and Switzerland,, were I everywbere
found specialization carried as far as possible
by the establishunent of translation services
in the various administrative branches. and
where there is thorougu satisfaction with the
systen in existence, J conclude that it is
desirable to extend to all the departmîxents
in Canada the practice already intelligently
introduced in sorne of them, as, for instance,
the Departnent of Agriculture and quite recently, if I am not nistaken, the Marine and
Fisieries Departmxent, and to entrust to the
varions services thus established the duty of
translating the annual reports of their departments. and. anong the other documents furnisled by then to both Houses, those of which
tha printing conmîittee naight recomiend the
publication.
The departmxental translator, laving a narrower field of avork, couild comparatively soon
master the two languages in the specialties
dealt with every year in the docunments issued
by his department. He could do his work maucli
more quickly and much better, all other things
being equal. His direct respons ibility for the
French version of the departmental publiceations
vould also naturally have a tendeney to secuure
his best efforts.
It was after this report that the system of
centralization was replaced by the present one,
which it is now desired to replace by centralization. That was Mr. Frechette's conclusion
in 1910.
Since then, another report lias come to us.
a much more recent one, that of 1933,
presented by the Sellar Commission. In the
course of the year 1932, the deputy ministers
of the various departments, questioned on
the desirability of centralizing translations,
declared unanimously in favour of maintaining
the status quo. They invoked against centralization the necessity, for each department, of
a speedy translation, without the risk of any
indiscretion, of correspondence or documents
of a confidential nature. To these arguments
may be added various reasons of an administrative order.
In December of the same year a commission composed of high officials of tie
varions departments was formed in order te

in this respect.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable members,
in rising to support the stand taken by my
honourable friend from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr.
Prévost) my purpose is net to offer any
deliberate opposition to the Bill. I do fear
this measure, though, because of its possible
effects not only on the solemn agreements
entered into by the Government of Canada
with its employees, but also on the freedom
and independence of this honourable House.
Therefore I consider it my duty as well as
my right and privilege to put myself on
record accordingly.
My honourable friend who has just resumed
bis seat proposed an amendment and gave
his reasons therefor in French. For the enlightenment of my honourable colleagues who
do not understand that language, but listened
so courteously and sympathetically to his
remarks, I shall endeavour to give briefly
their purport.
My honourable friend advanced these
reasons, amongst others, to justify his opposition to the Bill: (a) it is not at all evident
that such legislation will bring about greater
economy and efficiency; (b) the Bill is not
based on a sufficient study of the merits of
the present system; (c) similar proposals have
been put to the test in the past and found
wanting; (d) the system suggested has been
discarded by other bilingual countries, namely
Switzerland and Belgium.
I fully endorse those reasons.
I know it is against the rules of this House
to attack a member of the other branch of
Parliament, and I should be the last one to
say anything disrespectful of a Minister of
the Crown. However, so many contradictions,
inconsistencies, and incomplete assertions are
to be found in the many statements made by
the sponsor of this Bill in another place, that
one is justified in concluding that the honourable gentleman is not as fully conversant
with the situation as he claims to be. Let
me mention two or three instances.
Honourable members who attended the sittings of the Standing Committee on Internal
Economy will recall that the Hon. Secretary
of State complained about the great trouble
he had to secure a capable man to translate
official documents, particularly documents
sent by 'his department to foreign governments. He complained, too, that between
the sessions of Parliament he could not secure

491

sufficiently competent help for the translation
of parliamentary papers. I would remind
honourable senators that never has a complaint been made with respect to the translation of Bills. I would also direct attention
t
to the fact · hat the Trade-marks, Patents and
Copyrights Branch, which is under the direct
control of the Secretary of State, has a
competent translator, Mr. Lucien Hudon.
The honourable Minister bas also a translator attached to his private office in the
person of Mr. Van Veen. This gentleman
is available all the year round, and the
Secretary of State has declared him to be
"very competent to translate into French or
English."
Honourable members are also aware that a
great deal of so-called unnecessary expense
was mentioned by a high official of the Civil
Service Commission, if not by the Secretary
of State himself. To show that I do not
draw upon my imagination I will name the
gentleman-Mr. Bland. He mentioned that
$78,000 was spent unnecessarily every year
to cover the cost of the excessive number of
corrections that had to be made in the copy
because of faulty French translation. Ultimately it was elicited from the same gentleman that the exact amount was not $78,000,
but $58,80525. Some honourable members
were curious to know how this exact amount
had been arrived at, and they were told that
it applied as much to corrections in the
English as in the French translation. This
important detail had not been stated when
the figures were first presented to the committee. I shall return to this aspect of the
question, for I consider it very important.
At no time could the committee secure the
specific items making up the exact total of
658,805.25. No, sir! Question after question
was asked, but never answered. There is a
reason for this reticence on the part of those
in the department who produced the figures,
and I ask honourable senators whether they
are satisfied with such incomplete information.
I for one am not.
Honourable members will also recall that
when certain photostats of corrections in
iFrench translation were submitted to the
committee I asked the Secretary of State to
produce photostats showing corrections in
English translation, but none were available.
Apparently somebody was determined to place
all the blame for faulty translation on the
French translators. I am vigorously opposed
to such unfair tactics.
I cite these few instances, not because I am
inspired by any antagonism to the Bill, but
in order that honourable members may be
seized of the facts.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: May I ask my honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Do not the same men
translate from French to English as from
English to French?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I am not familiar with
the work of the translators.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: That is the way the
work is done. The honourable gentleman is
complaining that an attempt bas been made
to throw all the blame on faulty French translation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The translation from
French into English does not represent five
per cent of the work.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I am not talking of
percentages. I say the same mon do all the
work of translation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: No sufficient reason
was given for the failure on the part of the
Secretary of State to produce photostats showing corrections in the English translation.
That is the point I am directing attention to
now. The personnel of the translation staff
does not enter into the question at all.
At the outset of my remarks J stated that
inherent in the Bill is a threat against the
solemn engagements into which the country
has entered with certain civil servants. In
order to buttress my argument, I shall quote
certain authorities whieh I consider entirely
relevant to this case. I do not expect they will
be challenged, for these authorities happen to
be in the ranks of those who support the Bill.
Last session my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr,. Murdock) introduced a
motion to lower the pensions of officials of
the Canadian National Railways. The rigbt
honourable leader of this House (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen), referring to the respect we
should have for solemn undertakings and
agreements, is reported at page 217 of Senate
Hansard of 1932-33 as follows:
As the resolution reads, it would really be
a denand upon Parliament to fall away from
definite contracts of honour.
Me next authority is the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griebach).
He is reported at the same page of Hansard
in these words:
Any man who bas entered the Civil Service
in the last few years cornes under the Superannuation Act. and lie has a contract. He is
Hon. Mr LACASSE.

entitled to look

forward to the implementing

of that contract at the end of his service, but
the resolution introduced by my honourable
friend. if passed, would affect many such men.
I say that we ought not to pass this resolution.
I submit that to endeavour to interfere with
the terms of the contract embodied in an Act
of Parliament would be unworthy of any gov-

crnment and of this House.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is the emphatic
and authoritative statement made by my
ionourable friend from Edmonton. I have
another statement made by my right honourable friend in the same debate. It will
be found at page 220 of the same Hansard:
But the honourable member asks us to vote
that the law be changed, when we know that
if it were changed in accordance with the
resolution the grossest kind of injustice and
breach of eontract would result.
How solemn and how authoritative!
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Does my honourable
friend claim that, regardless of circumstances,
certain civil servants have an absolutely
vested right in tIeir positions?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: As much as the judges
had a year ago.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I am speaking of civil
servanth-a different class.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: This is the only
difference: the civil servants are still in the
service of the country; the judges are honourable "has-beens."
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman bas net answered the question.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I am net dealing with
judges at present. However, if we raise our
voices in protest when a proposal is made
in this House to lower the pensions of retired
railroad men, we should be just as insistent
to respect the contracts made with men who
are still in the service of the country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who wants
to do otberwise?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Please compare section 61 of the Civil Service Act with section 4
of this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nobody wants
to do otherwise.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I disagree with my
right honourable friend. By this Bill we
ignore the contracts entered into with those
men.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; we do
net dismiss anybody; but even if we did,
it would net be a breach of contract.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: W'here is it stated
in rthe Bill that nobody is to be dismissed? It
may be rnen.tioned in a statementRight Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Wiil the honourable member listen to the question? Does
the dismissai of a public servant constitute a
hreaeh of a sacred contractt with the Government of Canada?
Righ-t Hon. Mr. GRAHAM. lIt wouid. be if
it were without cause.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGR EN: Certainly, uniess it were under the terms of the law by

not cail for the dismissai of anybody.
lion. Mr. CASORAIN: They are engaged

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. 0f
course they would have .to receive reasonable
notice, or dismissai would be unfair. It is 11o
breach of ýcontract.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: The clauses in the
contract do not refer only to dismissal by the
minister in charge; they refer aiso to the
conditions under which empioyees work, the
salaries they receive, and rnany other things.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourabie gentleman suggest that Parliarnent
cannot change the conditions under which the
employees work? What is Parliarnent for?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: 1 used the right
honourable gentleman as my authority to
stress that a while ago.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is an
entirely different thing.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I leave it to the
House to judge. It is not pleasant to have
our own statements used egainst us,' and I
have every sympathy for my right honourable friend.
Now I corne to my lest point, not beceuse
I arn scared off, but just because 1 do not
want to impose upon the House a speech
that is too long. I have tried to make my
remarks as emphatic and as brief as possible,
because the length of a speech is not always
the measure of its w.orth. I arn now coming
to the independence of this House. Now
and then, in the course of the lest few
years particuiarly, we have noticed repeated
endeavours on the part of another branch of
Parliament to encroech upon the rights and
prerogatives of this honourable body-this
so-caiied independent House. I dlaim that
this measure sirnply goes one ste.p further in
the sarne direction, and dispossesses the
Canadien Senete of sorne of its legitimete
rights and prized prerogatives by removing

from its exclusive control a certain number
of its employees, inciuding some of the most
important members of its staff. Arn I right
or arn I wrong? I do not say -that the
num-ber of these employees is very large; but
emong them are some of the most important ones.
We ail heard in this very Chamber, flot
long ago, very eloquent speeches and beautifui discourses ernphasizing the importance of
the Senate as a necessery adjunct to the
Parliarnent of Canada, as a body which perf orrns its solimn duty in a serene atmnosphere
of unirnpaired independence, as a Supreme
Court of Justice, so to speak, where ail issues
of -a contentious nature are soived in the unbiased light of wisdom and fair playHear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: -and where suifering minorities find-particuiarly in the person of rny honourable friend frorn Winnipeg
(Hon . Mr. McMeans)-their most constant
and strongest protectors. Just imagine, honourable members, this magnificent parliarnentary body, free in its decisionsHon. Mr. TANNER:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I arn gled 1 arn speak-ý
ing loud enough to enable my honourable
friend from Pilctou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) to
understand me. Just imagine this magnificent parliamentery body, free in its decisions,
sovereign in its rulings, with shackies around
its feet and a Damocietian sword hanging
over its head. That is the pictore which
graduai encroechrnents, and repeated intimidations in the form of bis such as the one
before us to-day, are prepering; that is the
unavoidable fate which is ini store for the
Senate of Canada unless we refuse one of
these djeys to be a mere rubber stamp in
the hends of the powers thet be.
In view of these facts, and for ail these
reesons, I intend to support the amendment
of the honourabie senetor from Mille sles
(Hon. Mr. Prévost).
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHiEN: Honourable members, it may be that the honoureble senetor who has just taken his seat
included me, by implication, in his reference
to those who had not sat through the entire
speech of the mover of the present amendment. I was absent for possibiy five or ten
minutes, no more, because of the necessity
of canceliing another appointment in order
that 1 might be present during the speech
of my honoureble friend.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It is very kind of
you.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: J am disappointed that the honourable gentlemen who
moved and seconded this amendnient should
have introduced it into the discussion. After
the plea of honourable members opposite, as
well as of one or two or more on this side,
being acceded to-namely a plea that the Bill
be referred to a standing committee of the
House, nottiwitlstanding that it had been before a committee of the o.ther House and
had received most careful and somewhat prolonged review. having regard to the extent
of the measure--I had hoped there would
be no necessity for an anendment now,
much less for any substantial division of
opinion as to the merits of the Bill itse-lf.
But we are faced with an anendment which,
if passed b the House, will ihave the effect
of stripping the measure of a great proportion
of its value. The amendment in effeet removes from the scope of the Bill all those
engaged in the actual work of translation in
either the House of Commons or the Senate.
This would of necessity mean a very large
proportion of the ninety-one ernployees paid
by the treasury of Canada for performing this
service. It would represent an even larger
proportion of the $252,000 odd paid annually
by way of remuneration.
The contention, so far as I have been able
to grasp it, and I followed the honourable
senator as well as I could, aises not from a
fear .that any injustice will be done the French
language, but ratiter out of consideration for
certain allcged vested rights held I certain
people who have been doing translation work;
and further, with special refercnce to the
speech of the honourable senator who has just
sat down (Hon. Mr. Lacasse). from the standpoint of the autononous and coequal powers
and prerogatives of the Senate of Canada. I
am glad the measure is not seriously attacked
-in fact I an not certain that it is attacked
at all-with the argument that it will not conform to the plenary rights of tc
French
langurage as established by the British North
America Act.
No one whio studies the Bill
carefully can have the least suspicion that it
could assail what is undouttedly a completely
established right. There is no honourable
member of the Senate,-and I hope I can say
the same of 'the other House,-who wants to
curtail, abbreviate or impair the full rights
of that language as established by the British
Nortih America Act. That these rights are coequal with those of the English language in
the Parliament of Canada everyone agrees;
nor would any member of this House be a
party to any legislation which mortagaged or
shackled those definitely conceded and fully
recognized rights.
Hon.

Mr. LACASSE.

French is not a secondary language.
In
the matter of the records of this House-as
of the other House-in the matter of translations of debates, bills and other documents,
it stands coequal with English. The purpose
of the measure-as I think is really recognized
by all; I know it is by the vast majority-is
te live up to the standard set by the Constitution of our country with respect to the
French language. net less efficiently, but more
efficiently; to have the work we are bound to
do, and glad to do. done not ill but well;
to overcom e defects whirh undoubtedly have
prevailed in years gone by, and to establish
thc service on a well organized and effective
basis.
What has been the basis in the p-t?
Herein I confine myself mainly to that aroa
of the work of translation which the honourable member seeks to exclude. Those doing
the work of the Senate have net been under
any department of Government, or in any
way subject to any minister; in fact, they
have had no head of any kind. They have
teen under the supervision of the Senate-as
othters, doing the work for the House of
Commons. have been under the supervision
of that House-but for seven months of the
year, on an average. the Senate is not sitting,
and during that period ticy are at large,
withouf control or command, servants of
themselves, but paid out of the treasury of
te Dominion. Now, I aslk honourable meibers. is that a rational, businesslike mnethod
of conducting the public service? That is
Ihe situation whict tas existed for some time;
but does its existence establis on the part
of those wxho have enjoyed it anything in
fie wav of a vested right? Are we, if we
sek to improve, breaking solemn contracts
entered into by the State?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
The expression is
that of the right tonourable gentleman.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I know it
is, and I am net derogating from it or trying
to flee from it. There is no member on
cielier side of the House who wants to break
a contract witl a civil servant. Our contracts
xvith our servants are just as sacred as the
contracts of a private employer, or more se.
But wto is seeking to violate such a contract?
In the first place, contractual service
is terminable, provided it is terminated
according to law. There is no vested life
interest in a civil service position. Secondly,
no one is seeking to terminate it.

The pur-

pose of the Bill is to secure better work by
means of better organization.
The honourable gentleman quotes against
me a principle I ventured to express, that the

JUNE 13, 1934
contractual righits of those who had earned
them should be held sacred hy Parliament.
I arn glad it is flot seriously alleged that
there is any invasion of the rights of the
Frenchi language. There is none whatever.
The honourable gentleman did seek to establish that there was an evasian of some contractual right of emplayees of the Government, but 1 think I have shown there is not.
The anus is on him to show that there is.
What is the contract, and where is the
violation?
Now Jet us pass to the argument that we,
because of our legisiative powers, ought to
have charge of aur own service, and that
no.body else should have such charge. I ask
honourable gentlemen to recall that in the
early days of this Parliament the Senate of
Canada cxercised this same sort of direct
jurisdiction and command over utiier featurep
of our work. Wc once had contrai of our
grounds; we had control of the purchase of
aur furniture; we had control of every servant
of this House. Thase days have passed.
Hon. Mr. CASGIIAIN: They should have.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: And they
should have passed, hecause of the necessity
of getting things done in the best way. Te
Senate is flot in a position ta act as, nor
entitled ta get the henefit of, an employer who
pays out of his own purse. The features 1
mention have passed to certain departments
of the Government. Has the Senate suffered?
Have aur coequal legislative rights been
abbreviated? Has aur dignity been impaired?
If sa, I have not feit the force of the impairment.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: We have joint committees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: We have j oint
committees in respect of the library and the
restaurant, but nat in respect of the service of
this House or in respect of the grounds.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: What is the use, then,
of joint committees?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Where the
service is comnmon the supervision, as exercised
by joint committees, is necessarîly common
tao. I arn nat sure that it would not be
better ta go furthcr and transfer other departmente se0 that there might lie better arganizatian than there can be even under joint cammittees.
Daes anybody scriously feel that the wark
of translation is nat gaing ta, le done well in
future, especially after hcaring the letter of
the :Secretary of State? The honaurable
member suggests that that is nat law. That

495

i.s truc. I do not know that the letter is very
important in any event. But I amn quite certain it will be lived up ta. What the letter
says is that there will be conferences with
the officers of this Hause with respect to the
service of this House. What mare could be
expected, or wbat cisc could be demanded?
The argument bas been advanced that the
officer who is specially engagcd in preparing
records and documents in French is no mare
a transiator than is the corresponding officer
who does the work of preparing the English
documents. That may be. At lea.st it is
truc that the French document is as much an
original as is the E&iglish. Similarly the
French debates are as much originals as are
the English. In this respect the two versions
are coequal. But translation wark has ta he
donc, occasionally from French inta English
and often from English into Frenchi. We
ought ta sec that this work is performed in the
most effective way and under the most efficient
organization. This,' no marc and no less, is
the purpose of the Bill. I hope honourable
members will realize that there is in this
measure no design against anyone, but there
is a design ta get an essential and very important part of the work of bath bouses of
Parliament and of the whole federal service
donc better. There ia no intention ta be
unjust ta a single employec of this Government, but it is contemplated that special
privileges heretof are existing because of a
bad system shaîl lie done away with under a
good system.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The right honourable gentleman says that tlhe two versions
are cocqual. I arn informcd that in the
province of Queliec if there is any doulit on
account of the translation the French version
prevails. I do not know whether there is a
similar rule here.
Right bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. Here the
two arc absolutely eýqual. .And I am inclined
ta think that they are sa in Quelice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My hon ourable
friend from De Lan-audière (Hon. Mr.
Ca.sgrain) appears ta be in error. I think the
last part of the Civil Code af the province
of Quebec declares that, while the two texte
are valid, the anc nearer ta what was the
oid law prevails.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Then the twa
languages are abso-lutc-ly equal.
I ought alsa ta point ont ta honourable
memibers that an appeal was made ta this
House to have the Bill sent ta a standing
committee, on thc ground that certain officiaIs
who would bie affected had a right ta lic

heard.
The Bill was committed and the
standing committee met several times, but
not one of the officials concerned came and
asked to be heard. This would indicate that
they were not able to show the measure contemplated any injustice, and that they did
not consider any real right was being invaded.
Hon.
R. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, on the motion for second reading
of this Bill I stated that I had always felt
the combining of the debates translation
staffs of both Houses would work to the
great advantage of the translation service in
our own Chamber. I am still of that opinion.
I favoured the proposal to send the measure
to a select committee because I thought such
a committee would examine into the question
of riglits to which our translation staff is
entitled under the terms of engagement, so
that we might know whether there was to
be any invasion of their privileges. The
terms of engagcment are governed by the
Civil Service Act, Cha.pter 22 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927. Sections 61 and 62
of that Act provide:
61. 'The provisions of this Act relating to
appoin tment. transfer, promotion. salaries,
increases thereof, classification, political partisanship and payment of gratuity on death
shall apply to the permanent oflicers. clerks
and emnloyees of both Houses of Parliament
and of the Library of Parliament, and wherever
any action is authorized or directed to be
taken by the Governor in Council or by order
in council, such action, with respect to the
officers, clerks and emîploy ees of the Senate or
the House of Commons. shall be taken by the
Senate or the House of Commons, as the case
may be, by resolution.
62. Nothing in this Act shall be held to
curtail the privileges enjoyed by the officers.
elerks and employees of the Senate, House of
Conmons or Library of Parlianent with
respect to rank and precedence, attendance,
office hours, or leave of absence, or with respect
te engaging in such employment during pachamnentary recess as may entitle them to receive
extra salary or remuneration.
I do not know whether the Internal Economy Committce studied the Bill with a view
to making sure that none of the clauses would
work an injustice to any member of our
staff.
It is a question whether the translaition
work, which bas hitherto been performed
under the direction of our Clerk, and, I believe, to his satisfaction, will be as well done
when the translators are removed from his
control. I was present when the 'Clerk was
asked how he felt towards the measure, and
he declared he was quite dissatisfied w>th it
because it meant he would no longer have
charge over his translation staff, whom he
required te have under his authority throughRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

out each session, as well as for some time
before and after the session.
I dislike one feature of the way in which
this Bill was presented in the other House,
namelv, that it was brought down wi-thout any
conference with the Senate. Yet it contained
a provision that a certain number of our staff
would be taken from under our control and
merged into a bureau. During my membership in this Chamber we have more than once
had occasion to hold joint conferences with
the other House for the purpose of examining
into the possibility of combining certain
services. I think that is the proper procedure
when anthing of the kind is contemplated.
We have two Houses of Parliament. equal
in standing. Yet the Government of the day
saw fit to introduce, witibout consulting the
Senate, legislation having to do with part of
the Senate's staff.
This Bill has been passed by the House
of Commons, which bas thereby decided to
abandon control over a number of its emp l oy'ees in favour of a new bureau. The
Senaie is now asked to do likewise. I confess that I am not entirely satisfied with the
amendment proposed by my honourable
friend from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Prévost),
because it goes further than J think it should
go. I do net believe the amendment would
simply make sure that the privileges granted
to our translators at the time of their cngagement would be respected. In declining to
vote for the amendment I hesitate because
a certain official, who is one of our most
efficient translators of bills and other documents with which he is called upon to deal,
became' a member of the staff after I had
told him that the position carried certain
privileges, and that if be accepted it be would
be free to (o as he pleased in the period
between sessions, when the Clerk declared his
services were not required. I feel a certain
personal responsibility in the matter. Yet I
cannot vote for the amendment, because it
would have the effect of precluding the union
of the debates translation staffs of the two
Houses. So my position is not a happy one.
The.re is no question that the Bill bas some
virtue. I do not know that it will result in
an increase of efficiency, but I am sure it will
lead to an improvement in connection with
the translation of Senate debates. It is net
so certain that the work of the varions
departments will be done as well when they
no longer have their technical translators
under their own control. Yet I recognize
that such translators will be at the disposal
of the departments. It will be for the Superintendent of the Bureau to study the situa-

JUNE 13, 1934
tion and see to it that the specialized service
continues to be available as required.
On the whole, I may say that my difficulty
is in facing a state of things which I helped
to create and which is disturbed by the
present measure.

NATURAL PRODUCTS MARKETING
BILL
MOTION FOR

SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 51, an Act to improve
the methods and practices of marketing of
natural products in Canada and in export
trade, and to make further provision in connection therewith.
He said: Honourable senators, this is an
important Bill. While I hope the House will
not delay too long its decision as to second
reading, I think I should take a little time
in outlining the purposes of the measure. I
doubt not that most honiourable members
have read its various provisions.
In any
event, because of the discussions that have

497

taken place in the other Chamber, and comments that have appeared in the press, all
honourable members have of course a fairly
adequate conception of the principal objective. The scope of the proposed legislation
is confined to the marketing and distribution
of natural products.
The Bill provides, in the first place, that the
Governor in Council may establish a board
to be known as the Dominion Marketing
Board. A representative number of persons
engaged in the production or marketing of
any natural product may petition the Governor in Council to approve a scheme for
regulating the marketing of that natural
product by a local board under the supervision of the Dominion Board.
If the
petitioners are deemed to be sufficiently representative, the scheme will be referred to
the Dominion Board with a request for a
report. Then if the Dominion Board recommends the approval of the scheme, and if the
Minister also is in favour of it, the Governor
in Council may appoint such a local board,
give approval to the scheme, and fix the
date when it shall become effective.
The Dominion Marketing Board works in
association with the local board situated in
and operating from the area where the goods
are produced and from which the marketing
is to be done.

The Bill provides a definition for the "regulated product." It may be any natural product produced anywhere in -the Dominion, or
in any province, or in any section of any
province. The area is to be defined in the
scheme to be presented to the Government
as preliminary to the appointment of the
marketing board. There must, of course, be
jurisdiction in regard to the operation of the
statute, and consequently the statute is made
to apply to any regulated product with respect to which there is interprovincial or export trade.
The Bill also provides that in the case of
provincial legislation empowering a provincial
board to function with respect to any natural
product, that provincial board may become a
local board under the Dominion Marketing
Board; but ni course, being a provincial
creation, it is subject to the overriding power
of the Provincial Government, though under
the Bill it may be vested with certain powers
which are federal.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Even though it
is to control provincial trade only.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
provincial legislation would vest it with
powers with respect to provincial trade. The

7472"32
REVISED EDITION

SENATE

federal legislation then, if invoked, may vest
it with powers with respect te interprovincial
or expert trade.
An Hon. SENATOR: They can co-operate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
same board may act under provincial and
under federal powers.
The Bill further provides that such board,
if created, may make assessments with respect te the marketing of the regulated product, defined and limited as I have previously explained, and that from its funds
the Marketing Board may, under certain
clearly defined conditions, compensate producers or marketers for losses incurred by
reason of the supervision exercised for the
benefit of al], but net for such losses as result
from the closing of foreign markets te the
products, or from inferiority in quality of the
goods sought te be marketed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the assessment go beyond the parties who have asked
for the local board?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. The
assessment would be applied te the whole
regulated product, though the parties who
invoke the Act may be representative of only
a portion of the industry. It would obviously
be impossible te have everybody invoke the
Act with respect te a specially regulated product. Consequently, when it is felt there is
such a preponderating demand as te warrant
the establishment of the board, all must conform.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
wish te or net?

Whether they

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHFi: Yes; otherwiso
the Act of course would be utterly ineffective.
Then the funds. whi.ch may be raised by
assessment or may be granted by vote of
Parliament, may be used for other purposes,
but those purposes are not of such importance
as te demand recital. They are clearly set out
in the measure.
The Bill also provides that on being convinced of the necessity, the Governor in
Council may in the general interest establish
a board in respect of any natural product
sought te be regulated. These provisions are
analogous te certain provisions in the Combines Investigation Act.
The Bill further provides that the board
may withhold goods from market because of
quality, and may acquire goods or real estate
for the purposes of the working of the measure,
and that goods may be stored and improved
even by processing. In general. the marketers
light Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

and the producers will in respect of the regulated product be under the supervision and
subject to the control of this board te the
extent of the powers of the Parliament of Canada; and also to the extent of the powers
of the Provincial Parliament, if such Provincial Parliament exercises those powers
which are peculiarly its own.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Do I understand that if
the producers do net organize the Government may step in?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, the Government may take the initiative and establish
the board by virtue of the powers granted it
by section 9 of the Bill.
Now, I have sketched very briefly the purpose of the first part of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before the right
honourable gentleman passes to the second
part, can he give an explanation as to what
constitutes an area? For instance, if a group
in a county of New Brunswick asked that
potatoes be regulated, and their request were
granted, would that regulation cover the one
county, or the whole of New Brunswick, or
the whole of Canada?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If those engaged in the potato industry in a county of
New Brunswick decided to have the potato
industr'y placed under the provisions of this
measure, they could give the information which
,the Act specifically requires with respect to the
scheme. They of course would make out their
.icheme for the area of their own county.
Tle scheme does not have to be accepted, and
obviously it would be utterly futile to seek
to treat as a regulated product the potatoes of
one county of the province of New Brunswick. But if the potato growers, say, of the
Maritime Provinces sought to make their
potatoes a regulated product, the Governor
in Council conccivably might say, "Well, if
we make the potatoes grown in that area a
regulated product, the scheme nay possibly
work." But Council might not come to that
conclusion. They might say, "You widl have
to take in the potatoes of the whole DoA representative number of the
minion."
potato growers would have te ask that potatoes be a regulated product before the scheme
would be practicable.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Se if a neighbouring province does not join it remains
outside the scheme?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. If the
potato growers of the neighbouring province
do net join in the scheme, they cannot b
included in the area. Of course, there would

JUNE 13, 1934
have to be such a number of growers repre
sentative of the area they seek to include in
the scheme as to warrant the creation of a
board. Certainly such a board never would
be created un-less those petitioning were fully
rep-resentative of the producers and marketers
within the area they seek to have controlled.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Could the board bring
the three Maritime Provinces into one area
without the specific consent of the respective
provincial governments or of any existing
provincial boards?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They could
with respect to interprovincial or to export
business. But it is utterly inconceivable they
would do so unless it was the preponderant
wish of those engaged in the industry of that
whole area.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What, if any, consideration has been given in Part I of this
Bill to the rights of the consumer?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Canada has
an enormous yield of natural products. Our
paramount interest is in the producers of
those products, because we have a surplus for
sale. I as a consumer should certainly be
delighted if the producer of natural products
could get better prices. The main object is
to establish such conditions of production and
marketing as will get the best price that world
conditions permit under the circumstances.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And the consumer
will have to pay that price?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Where the
goods are under our supervision the consumer
is the export consumer. Certainly he will
pay that price, and he will be delighted, to
pay it, because if we improve the conditions
of the producer of natural products in this
country, the indirect benefit to the consumer
wiil vastly outweigh any extra price he may
haye to pay. I only hope the general benefit
will be such that there will be some extra
price. Then both the consumer and the producer will rejoice.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Supposing a potato
grower is hard up and wants to sell his crop,
will he have to sell at the big price?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I only hope
the vision which the senrator has of a big
price will be realized-in part, anyway. No;
this Bill cannot affect the local marketing,
it bein-g beyond our jurisdiction. It may be
the province would come in and say, "In order
to make this plan effective generally we shall
have to make it apply locally." But until
the province does that the producer will be
free to market locally.
74728-32J

Now, while there is provision for the
creation of the board, there is also provision
for its discontinuance. There is provision for
the polling of those engaged in the producing
of the regulated product to see if they really
want the legislation invoked. If the Act
goes into effect in relation to the product,
then a poll has to be taken before the application of the Act can be discontinued.
There is also provision for uniting local
boards and for extension of their powers in
order that the objective sought by the measure may be attained.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: In reading the debate
on this Bill in another place, I have wondered how we are to prevent the formation
of a multiplicity of boards to deal with a
number of different products. Is there to be
a separate board for each product, or can
one board deal with several products? Will
the right honourable gentleman tell us briefly
how this is to be carried out?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Certainly
the Governor in Council can insist that in
any area the same board deal with several
natural products. Several boards may be
united in the interest of economy. Amalgamations of course would also reduce the
number. Anyone reading the Bill might
think five hundred boards might be formed
in almost no time, but I do not think this
is at all likely, for the reason that there will
be a tendency on the part of those engaged
in the producing and marketing of one
product to let the other fellow try it outto let the dog have a little dose to see how
it works. If they think the scheme can be
made a success they are likely to come in.
That probably would be the disposition of
most of those engaged in the production and
marketing of the products.
The second part of the Bill has to do with
investigations. The Minister is given power,
similar to that conferred by the Inquiries
Act, to make investigations as to price
spreads, high cost of conditioning, commissions, profits accrued by virtue of processing
or manufacturing to a degree-in short, as to
all the various charges that come in between
producer and consumer. Under the Act it is
a criminal offence to make charges that are
unreasonable or constitute a hindrance to
trade and commerce. Having made a preliminary investigation, the Government can
appoint a committee with power to extend
the inquiry and to make recommendations for
the curing of any evils of the nature of in-

the Bill, "nd, as I have stated, they all were
approved by the proponent of the measure.
I woudd not attempt to explain the amendments one by one, but there will not be the
least objection to going into Committee of
the Whole, if the House desires to take that
step.
Hon. Mr. BLACK moved concurrence in
the proposed amendments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members may rest assured that the amendments made by the committee do not in the
least weaken the stringent regulations that
the Bill contained when it came to us from
the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are not
in any way.

emasculated

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Perhaps the right
bonourable leader can tell us whether any
of the amendments are very important.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest
that the Chairman of the committee tell us
about them.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: There is an amendment
to page 13 which refers to violation of certain provisions. Do you want me to go into
it fully?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

No.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: That amendment is
important. I will read it:
If any loan is made by the company in
violation of the foregoing provisionsIt is necessary to have read the preceding section to understand this.
-all
directors and officers of the company
making the same or assenting thereto, shall,
until repayment of the said loan, be jointly
and severally liable to the company and to its
creditors for the debts of the company then
existing or thereafter contracted; provided
that such liability shall be limited to the
amount of said loan with interest.
That does not change the intention of the
Bill, but, I think, clarifies it and makes the
obligation more definite.
On page 16 there are certain changes recommended in section 24, but these are of the
kind referred to by the right honourable
leader, and I do not think it is worth while
to read them. They are notHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not important.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Well, they are important
in that they make the Bill more workable.
Passing over a number of such amendments,
I want to call attention to a somewhat more
important one on page 97. This incorporates

501

into our legislation certain conditions and
provisions which are in the British Companies
Act, and which have to do with the actions of
a director who has done the best he could
in the distribution or investment of a company's moneys, or in regard to differences of
exchange. If such actions should result in
a loss to the company, in the event of court
proceedings the judge may find that the
director used his best judgment and is to be
held not liable. I will read those provisions,
if honourable members so desire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I have mentioned, not
by any means all the important changes, but
perhaps the outstanding ones. We have also
suggested that section 17 be amended to read:
Every one who, being a director, manager,
or officer of a company or acting on its behalf,
commits any act contrary to the provisions of
this Part, or fails or neglects to comply with
any such provisions, shall, if no penalty for
such act, failure or neglect is expressly provided by this Part, be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty of not more than one
thousand dollars, or to imprisonment for not
more than one year, or to both such penalty
and imprisonment: Provided no proceedings
shall be taken under this section without the
consent in writing of the Secretary of State.
Those are the four most important amendments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Possibly
the House would like to know the important
features in respect of which the law is changed.
It must be kept in mind-for honourable
members will probably be hearing criticism
of the Act later on-that in regard to company law the line of demarcation between
provincial and federal powers is a very important one. I think it can be said that it is
now pretty clearly established.
A company created under the authority of
this Act or of any corresponding federal Act
in the past can be endowed with such capacity
for business and hemmed around with such
restrictions of its operations in the sale of its
securities as the federal power may choose.
But once the securities pass from the company
and become the actual property of some other
concern, the jurisdiction of this Parliament
ceases and that of the provincial legislatures
begins. Consequently the Bill seeks to safeguard the public to the utmost of the federal
power so long as the company is within our
domain; that is until the securities become the
property of some other company.
Also in relation to companies created by this
Parliament, we can say how the directors are
to be liable, what kind of prospectus they

502

SENATE

mu-t issue, who must be responsible for every
word in it, and whether a director can vote in
relation to a special contract. In a word,
we can impose just such responsibilities as we
like upon the directors so long as it is a
federal company.
The Bill contains the most stringent provisions ever known in Canada with respect
to securities. The prospectus must include
a long list of data. covering several pages,
and be signed by all the directors and
filed with the departmeet, and any sale or
marketing of the securities must be donc
within a certain time of filing, or a new
prospectus must be filed. We take care that
before a purchaser becomes liable te must
be shown to have received a prospectus. We
cannot make him read it, but if te tas not
received a prospectus te can escape responsibility. We provide further-and it is all we
can do-that no one selling securities for the
company shall canvass from house to house or
make calls except to sec a man in his office.
There is a corresponding section in the British
Act. Severe penalties are imposed if the
clauses are violated.
After the securities are sold we impose
upon the directors and officers new and more
No
serious liabilities and responsibilities.
longer will a direct or be able to vote in
relation to a contract with anothter company
in whie, directly or indirectly, he has any
interest; and in the event of anything of
that character being before the board, he
must reveal his interest and refrain frorm
voting. He is under very teavy penalties
if te fails to conform te this new law.
Net only are loans to sharetolders or
directors forbidden, but directors who vote
for them are made liable for the amount so
voted; liable not merely to the company, but
also to the company's creditors to the extent
of the amount, until it is repaid. If dividends
which impair the capital of the company are
voted, however innocently, the directors are
liable. But no longer are they liable for all
the debts of the company, as ttey were under
an irrational and grotesque provision of the
old law. They are liable individually to the
extent of the money which they have voted
and should not have voted, and, however
innocent, they may escape the consequence
only by definite action within a week after
they become aware of what tas been done.
I have reviewed some of the salient features
of the Bill. I think it can be said that its
constitutionality is not seriously challenged
in any respect. Undoubtedly the Bill goes
ever before
further than any measure
attempted in this country to correct what are
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

believed to be the evils of the interlocking
directorate system. It goes further to make
a director a real director-if that can be
done. Many fear it goes so far that we shall
find companies more and more in the hands
of straw directors. Sorne feel that it goes so
far that hereafter the provinces, and not the
Dominion, will issue most of the charters.
Of course, it must be recalled that the provinces are moving in the same direction.
Ontario and Quebec and one or two of the
Western Provinces have gone to some length.
In thinking of the position of the public when
the securities are no longer within the prerogative of the originating company, but have
tecome the property of another company,
honourable members should bear in mind ttat
the sale immediately comes under what are
knovn as the blue skv laws of the various
provinces: the licensing and limiting legislation of those provinces immediately comes
into play. I think it can be affirmed that
there are now such provisions in all the
provinces, and Parliament is going as far as
it can go to protect the public against itself.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Do the provisions of
this Bill apply to a company already organized?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To a federal
company, yes.
The motion was agreed te.

STOTLAND DIVORCE CASE
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
rise to a question of privilege. It may be
that the matter which I wish to bring before
the Senate will come up a little later in the
day, but in view of the long list of orders
before us I desire to bring it up now. If
I should stray outside the strict rules of the
House in touching upon the matter of privilege, I beg that honourable senators will bear
with me, and perhaps, when they hear what
I have to say, they will grant me a little
indulgence.
For some considerable time there has been
a good deal of talk about the corridors of
this House, about the lobbies of hotels, and
in some clubs, concerning a premeditated

JUNE 14, 1934
and apparently prearranged solicitation of
members of the Divorce Commrittee in connection with one or more cases which have
corne before them. I arn going to refer to
the one case which 1 know of-the Stotland
case-the Teport upon which has been issued
by the committee within the last few days.
I amrn ot interested in this case, and I
know notbing about it except what I have
learned from the report that bas been presented to us. In fact, 1 did flot even know
the name of the case about wbich I heard
ail this talk until the report carne into my
bands. But I arn interested in the bonour of
this House and of bonourable senators who
forrn the Divorce ýCommittee.
There bas bccn in connection wîtb this particular divorce one of the most vicions lobbies,
I think, th-at bave ever taken place in the
Senate, and I want to protest against it.
This lobby bas been carried on by certain
parties cirectly and deliberately soliciting the
assistance of various members of the committee. It bas been carried on, I arn sorry
to say, by some honourable members; flot
many. I know of two, wbose names I arn
flot going to mention. Fortunately, there is
one of tbem on each side of tbe House; so
it cannot be said that this is a political
matter. These gentlemen have deliberately
undertaken to solicit several, if flot aIl, of
the members of the committee. Further, I
arn astounded to learn. the Chairman of the
committee bas been approacbed and directly
solicited by eminent counsel frorn Montreal
wbo have flot heretofore appeared in the
case.
I may be straying beyond the rule of
privilege if I ask this House what a judge
wouid say if, when he wus about to try a
case. counsel came and endeavoured to enlist
bis sympatby one way or the other. I tbink
that the wbole situation is rapidly becoming
a scandai, and that it sbould be brougbt to
ligbt before tbe Senate. witb a view to preventing a recurrence of any such tbing in the
future.
I arn not complaining of applications made
to various senators for their symrpatby, nor of
conversations between senators, beoause, after
a)dI, one of the evils of the present systema of
divorce is that divorces are granàted in the
Sonate by private bills, and I suppose honourable members have the s&rne right to, discus
divorce 'bills as 1ils of any other kind. But
members cf tbe Divorce, Committee are in
a position very different frorn thaît occupied
by members of ordinary business comimnittees
of tbe Senate. Their duties involve a consideration of rights that are very sacred and

personal. Tbey are not merely memabers of
a committee, but members of a judicial committee.
What has taken place is, I tbink, an encroaabhment upon the privilege of tbis Ibuse,
and I desire to draw the attention of honourable members to it.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable menibers,
as Obairman of tbe Divorce Com-mittee I
endorse every word that bas been uttered by
tbe bonourable gentleman. As be says, tbe
way. in whicb members of tbe Senate, and
sometimes meînbers of the Commiùtee on
Divorce, are approacbed by individuals frorn
outside wbo have some special interest in
influencing their verdict, is fast becoming
a scandai.
I arn sure it is weiil known. to every honourable rnemb-er of this House that even before
the evidence was taken a letter relating to
tbe case in question was written by a person
in a bigb position to a'member of tbe Seniate.
1 oannot divulge the contents of the letter,
beicause it is private. It is evident from the
nature of it, however, that it was written
for one purpose, and one only, namely, to
influence a member of this House. That member broacbed the subject, to tbe members of
the committee and told thern exactly wbat information be had received.
I regret to say that even tbis afternoon
a very prominent iawyer from, Montreal
approached me in my office with a view to
discussing this case afiter it bad been tried.
That gentleman, for whom I have the bigbest
respect, took out a sbeaýf of papers and asked
if I would read tbem. I said, "Wbat are
tbey?"~ He repilied, "A history of the f'amily'
I said, "Wby should I read them? Tbey are
not in evidence." "',elýl," be said, "shall I
leave them witb you?"~ I said, "No; I wouîd
not look at thcm."
To bave so înany storics filoating around
in reference to a case makes the position of
every enember of tbe committee very difficijît.
Jn tbe case the honourable gentleman has referred to, tbree prominent Iawyers appeared
for eacb side, and tbey occupied the time of
tbe committee for tbree days. Notwitbstanding that the be'aring bas been completed and
the report of the committee presented to the
Hous4e, these influences continue at work. If
there is a-ny way of putting a stop to tbem,
I sbould like to sec it done.
If a man approacbed a jury witb the idea
of influencing tbe verdict of a court of law,
be would be eomimitting a grievous offence;
or if be wrote to a judge wbo was trying a
case, with the intention of influencing bim

504

SENATE

in his decision, lie would place himself in a
very awkward position.
It is unfortunate that under the law of
the province of Quebec divorce cases arising
in that province cannot be tried there, but
must be dealt with by the Senate.
I heartily endorse every word the honourable gentleman lias uttered.
SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 94, an Act to amend
the Soldier Settlement Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the main
purpose of this Bill is to render all soldier
settlement lands liable to taxation by municipalities. These lands, as I apprehend the
position, have been for some time in the
name of the Director of Soldier Settlement,
but the Director bas been held to have title
in the lands for and on behalf of the Crown,
and not as a body corporate and politic.
Therefore the lands have been exempt from
taxation. For many years it was contended
-in fact, I so contended myself-that they
should be exempt. The Government, however, has recommended to Parliament, and
by the adoption of this measure the other
House has concurred in the recommendation,
that this exemption should no longer apply.
The Bill declares that although the Director
holds for the Crown, he sliall be considered
to hold as a body corporate, and that the
land shall be liable to taxation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does this
simply cover lands that have been returned
to the Crown, or does it relate to lands that
are held for a soldier who is tilling them and
has net yet obtained title?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Lands held

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 80, an Act to amend
and consolidaýte the Excise Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is this
about?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, as will be gathered from the folder
in my hand, this is a very extensive measure.
I think it should go to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. In the main it is
a consolidation of the pre.sent Act. The last
re-enactment of the law relating to excise
took place in 1883. In the regular revisions
made since that time the excise statutes, in
common with all others, have been consolidated, but there has been no general review
and re-enactment of the law.
The greater part of this Bill is made up
of a compilation of existing statutes, which
have been rearranged and abbreviated, as
statutes can always be when re-enacted.
There are only three other important features.
I do not know that they can be called very
important, but they are new. The first is
the abolition of the gallonage tax on beer,
and in place thereof an increase in the excise
duty. Likewise, the special tax on malt is
abolished and the excise duty increased.
Finally, there is appended to the Bill a
schedule of tariffs and duties, so that all
persons interested may readily see exactly
what is the excise tax in respect of any
article. This does not change the law, but
there has not been such a schedule before.
Whatever is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS BILL
SECOND READING
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 71, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to
authorize the provision of moneys to meet
expenditures made and indebtedness incurred
during the calendar year 1934, and to provide
for the refunding of certain maturing financial
obligations.
He said: Honourable members, this is
another Bill which is perennial. Its purpose
is the provision of money to take care of
the Canadian National Railways during the
calendar year 1934. As everyone knows, the
fiscal year of the National Railways is not
the same as that of the Dominion Government.
The Bill has two parts. The first makes
provision with respect to maturing obligations, construction and betterments, and
deficits. The amount required for maturities
is $12,185,828; for construction and betterments. $4,202,007; and for estimated deficits,
$48,840,298: an aggregate of slightly more
than $65,000,000 covered by the first part.
The apportionment of the $12,185,828 is set
out in paragraph a of section 2, which specifically describes the obligations as equipment
principal payments, sinking funds, miscellaneous maturing or matured notes and other
obligations not mentioned in the schedule.
As to the estimated deficits, it does not
follow that the actual figure will be so large.
I am hopeful that it will be smaller.
The second part has to do entirely with
old indebtedness. It enables the Administration to take care of the folilowing obligations:
$17,060,333.33 maturing on the lst of September, 1934; $3,510,250 maturing on the lst of
October, 1934; and exactly $17,000,000 maturing on the 15th of February next year. It is
thought wise to include this last item because
of uncertainty as to when the next session
will be held and whether at that session the
item could be attended to in time. The total
of the maturing securities covered by Part II
is $37,570,583.33. Within the limit of this
sum the Government will be empowered to
guarantee the issue by the coipany of new
securities, or to make loans to the company.
The refunding of these old debts wildl probably diminish the annual charges against the
lines, but of course the capital will not be
affected in any way.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We should be
grateful that the expenditure on capital
account is not fo go beyond the figure asked
for here, whiceh is a considerable reduction
as compared with amounts voted for this purpose in the past. But we are still facing the
probability of a heavy deficit, the estimate
for the year being nearly $50,000,000.
I do not know what improvements are
likely to be made in the operation of the
system. Some emotion was created in various
parts of the country, and perhaps nearer to
this Chamber than I should mention, over
the declaration by the President of the National Railways that some hundreds of miles
of lines would have to be scrapped with a
view to the saving of money. A great difficulty in the way of imiproving the company's
balance sheet lies in the fact that although
the management may clearly recognize that
a certain line should be discontinued, because it is unprofitable and the territory is
adequately served by another line, any
attempt at discontinuance is met with the
protest, in which members of Parliament for
the ridings concerned are asked to join, that
private interests would be seriously injured
by the move. Some two years ago it was
stated in an inquirv, before one of our
committees or a royal commision, that when
it was founi ne - rr
to surap a certain
line in the United States a miiill ownr and
a few settlers who were situated near the line
were given compensation. I believe the time
ivill corne when we in this Chamber shall find
it necessary to refer a bill such as the present
one to a standing committee, in order that
we may ascertain how the two companies
are working out the problem of discontinuing
lines that are absolutely unprofitable. Such an
nquiry could probably be made here to the
satisfaction of the country at large, since the
Senate is not amenable to direct pressure
from local interests. If next year we face
another deficit of $50.000,000, it may well
become this House to inquire into the whole
railway problem to see if we cannot suggest
means by which economies may best be
effected in the operation of the National
System.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable members, so far as I can see, the object of this
Bill is to authorize the payment of certain
securities, $17,00,333.33 maturing on September 1. $3,510,250 maturing on October 1, and
$17,000,000 maturing on February 15 next
year, a total of $37,570,583.33.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
object of the second part. The first part
has to do with three other things. There is
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

the matter of meeting obligations totalling
$12,185,828 in respuet of equipment notes and
so on. The next item is 84,202,007 for construction and betterments-new capital. It
was to this my' honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) referred as representng a very great rcduction in comparison
with the amount required in previous years.
Of course, no road can get along without
some new capital ceach year. And the third
item is the estimatcd deficit of $48,840,298
for 1934. I fancy this estimate was made
bofore there iwas evidence of the brighter
prospects which have been brought about by
nature within the past few weeks. The record
of improvement this year causes me to hope
that we shall not be as close as these figures
woulýd indicate to last year's deficit, which I
think was about S58,000,000. That may be
a little high.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If I remember
rightly, it was about $56,000,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: While the
present estimate is a reduction, it is somewhat of a disappointment to me. I am very
hopeful that the deficit this year will not
run to $48,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable members, we are paid to busy ourselves in matten
that we think are in the interest of the public,
and I have been giving some study to the
railway situation. The trustees of the Canadian National, of whom Judge Fullerton is
one, have no machinery to compel the Canadian Pacifie to do anything.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Of course
they have.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: rTie only way they
can force action is to go before the Railway
Board, and they dislike to start a lawsuit
that may drag on for a long time and perhaps be submitted to the Supreme Court and
the Privy Council.
The Canadian Pacifie
Company do not want to use Canadian
National rails; they say they would lose
prestige by doing so. Well, I do net think
they have much prestige to lose just now.
In order to meet their bond obligations they
had to borrow $60,000,000 without interest, I
am told. I am absolutely serious. I pay a
lot of attention to these matters, and I think
we all shoild do se. The Canadian Pacific
will not use the other company's tracks. I
could point to a case which I mentioned in
this House on a previous occasion, but I do
not want to take up too much time at present.
Surely the Canadian Pacific executive officials
could be told, unofficially if you like, that if
they refuse to act they will have to go to the
Railway Commission.

JIJNE 14, 1934

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The right
honourable gentleman a.sks if we desire to
refer this Bill to the Railway Committee. I
think it unnecessary, for this is really a
financial measure. We can criticize these expenditures, but it would be suicidai to,
refuse to vote the money required to carry
out a project authorized by legisiation we
passed just a year ago. Whatever discussion
is desired might well take place in Committee
of the Whole.
I was pleased to read the other day that
the head of the Board of Trustees of the
Canadian National Railways is somewhat
optimistie as to the future of the system. If
hie can be optimistic, we should not be s0
pessimistie; for hie knows the worst. It is
easy for us to suggest that because this or
that line is not paying it should be abandoned.
We have heen hearing a good deal about contracts. Well, there is certainly an implied contract with settlers in the West, who were
induced f0 settie in certain districts by the
promise of railway facilities. What would
become of those communities if we said:
"This railway line is not paying; therefore
we will take up the rails"? They would be
absolutely stranded. It is ahl very well for
persons travelling between Toronto or Ottawa
and Montreal to say that non-paying lines
should be abandoned; but those who are
being served by a branch line would be very
seriously inconvenienced if we deprived them
of their railway facilities, and any saving
effected would be more than offset by the
harm done to the publie interest.
I have great sympathy with the bead of
the Board of Trustees and with the president
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway in their diseussions of wbat lines may be abandoned,
for it is one of the most difficult, problems
to handie. There is not a member of this
House who would flot rise up and objeet most
strenuously, to the abandoument of a railway
line running close to bis home, even though
it did not pay the cost of operation.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: To the arbitral
tribunal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is the only
way to compel action; but it is a ýroundabout
way.
It is two years and a hall since Parliament
passed legislation to bring about co-operation
between the two railways. The executives of
the two systems say, "We are studying this
and that." But not very much is being doue.
True, there are pooi trains in operation
between Montreal and Toronto, Toronto and
Ottawa, and Montreal and Quebec. This,
however, is passenger business, whieh represents
only a small percentage of railway earnings.
Take some of our small towns served by two
lines. One railway is a necessity, but two
are a luxury. Why not use one line? I
told some of the tru.stees that I would bring
this matter before the House. I do not
believe the executives of the two systems are
coming together as they should do in the
public interest.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman bas not quite correctly described the machinery which. Parliament provided, not two years ago, but last session.
In pursuance of the legislation the Board of
Trustees of the Canadian National Railways
was appointed early in the faîl. The machinery
is not complicated: it is simple. The trustees
are in a position at any time to insist on the
Canadian Pacifie going to a tribunal on any
matter of the kind referred to. I think it is
fairer to assume that the trustees are exhausting every effort to bring about j1oint
economies without resort to the tribunal. I
have no reason to assume otberwise. I have
confidence in the trustees, especially the
chairman, wbom I have known for so long.
If these metbods fail, 1 believe hie will not
hesitate to use the machinery wbich the Act
provides. I quite coneur with my honourable friend that there bas not been as mucb
progress towards co-operation as we sbould
like to sce, but, having in mind the fact that
the trustees during the few montbs tbey bave
been in office have accomplished a good deal,
and that it is a gigantie entity which they
bave to examine, analyze and master, 1 think
it is too soon to complain.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

in order that a comparatively small operating
cost might be saved. We should not sacrifice
the interest of the country as a whole for
the sake of effecting railway economies,
though we must proceed as rapidly as
possible to get the railways on an even keel.
As the right honourable gentleman bas
said, the Railway Act of last session was not
brought into force until a few months ago.
This was not the fault of the railway companies. I have talked freely with the
executives of the two systems. They would
rather go as far as they possibly can without compulsion. We must not forget that
the chairman-of the trustee board is accountable to Parliament. He has to be careful
not to resort to compulsion if he can
accomplish as much, or nearly as much, by
voluntary means. The president of the Canadian Pacifie is responsible to his directors
and naturally he is doing the best ho can
for the shareholders who have put their
money into that great undertaking.
I agree with the right honourable leader of
the Government. We should not criticize too
severely the apparently slow progress that is
being made. The executives of the two railways know more about the actual condition
of affairs than we do, and we should give
thcm a reasonable opportunity to bring about
further co-operation.
Probably they will
attain their objective more quickly and more
surely by reaching an amicable arrangement
than if they adopt the plan, as suggested
in certain quarters, of rushing into the roalm
of compulsion.

It has already been before the Banking and
Commerce Committee of the other House,
which made a very careful study of the
measure. It is truc that in respect to the
Companies Act some of us had doubts
whether it should go to a standing committee, because it had been before a special
committee of lawyers of the other House,
who made a very close study of it. It certainly was a wise course to send it to our
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, for it received at the hands of that
committee attention of a character that it
could not possibly receive in Committee of
the Whole. I am net sure that this Bill
would not stand a similar review; in fact
I am inclined to think it would. But I do
net want to shut out any honourable senators
who are net members of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. My own

CANADA'S NEUTRALITY
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. W.' A. GRIESBACH rose in accordance with the following notice:

509

That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the necessity for adequate provision of
necessary forces to maintain the neutrality of
Canada in certain situations, and will inquire
of the Government what steps the Government
proposes to take to provide itself with the
means of maintaining neutrality.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, on the 6th
of the month I drew the attention of the
House to the matter of the defence of our seaborne trade; to-day I propose to introduce
the question of the maintenance of neutrality.
These two questions are not exactly analogous, but they lead to the same conclusion.
First, I should discuss the history of the
law of neutrality. It is a branch of international law, and is of comparatively recent
growth, though international law itself is an
oild science. The Romans, for instance, knew
nothing of neutrality in time of war. Neutrality is defined as the condition of those
states which in time of war take no part in
the conitest, but continue pacific intercourse
with the belligerents. The laws of neutrality
are designed to make war difficult and neutrality easy and to maintain peace. International law stands between nations as a
barrier to the barbarism that preceded it.
Every civilized nation, therefore, must make
its proper contribution -to the maintenance of
international law. The discharge of ail obligations imposed by international law, particularly the maintenance of neutrality, is such a
contribution.
Now, the law with respect to neutrality, as
t
laid down by · he writers on the subject, is
qualified by three possibilities. The first is
legislation passed by given countries, which
sets out their conception of neutrality, the
rights which they claim and the obligations
they propose to live up to and impose.
Second, there is adherence to the Hague Convention of 1907, which purports to be a code
of law with respect to neutrality. Finally,
there are the precedents established, which are
particularly binding upon the countries establishing them, and which may or may not be
acceptable to other nations of the worild. That,
briefly, is the history of the law.
The points of law which are of particular
interest to us, and to which I propose to draw
attention, are as follows. I am reading now
from certain sections in the Hague Convention. Belligerents are forbidden to use neutral
ports or waters as a base of naval operations
against their adversaries, and in particular to
erect wireless or telegraphy stations, or any
apparatus intended to serve as a means of
communication with the belligerent forces on
land or sea.

510

SENATE

It is scarcely necessary to say now that I
am referring to the position in which our own
country will find itself in the event of war
between two other countries, and I am discussing the law commonly accepted, which is
binding upon us.
Articles 15 and 16 outline the police powers
that must be exercised in the matter. A
belligerent warship may net leave a neutral
port or roadstead until twenty-four hours after
the departure of a merchant ship which flies
the flag of its adversaries. Similarly, twentyfour hours must elapse betwcen the departures
of belligerent warships. In both these cases
there is a duty laid upon the neutral state to
enforce neutrality, treating the two belligerents
fairly, and exercising certain police powers
compelling these belligerents to observe neutrality and international law.
When the belligerents are in our coastal
waters, or within our ports, they are in all
cases in armed ships, and we are required to
police them and compel them to observe the
law. Faihire to enforce neutrality is a breach
of n-eutrality.
If you permit one of the
belligerents to enter one of your harbours and
remain indefinitely, you are guilty of a breach
of neutrality.
Another rule is:
A neutral power rnust similarly release a
prize brotiglit into one of its ports under
circumstances other than those referred to in
Article 21.
And that refens to the capture of ships within
territorial waters.
There again the neutral
state must, by force, compel observance of
the law.
When the forces of a belligerent unlawfully
enter neutral territory and the neutral government does not or cannot expel them, the
other belligerent is justified in entering the
neutral territory for the purpose of preventing the violation from operating to his disadvantage.
I am quoting now from international law, and not from the Hague Convention. There you have some suggestion
of the consequences which will follow your
failure to maintain neutrality. You are likely
to have a battle staged by the belligerents
right in your own neutral waters. Take the
case of a belligerent country's vessel which
is threatened by another belligerent in a
neutral ha-rbour. I am now quoting Lord
Birkenhead, and be is quoting Westlake:
The threatened vessel must give the neutral,
if possible, an opportunity of doing his duty,
either by force or by peaceful means. If
there is no time for this, or the neutral
disregards the appeal, it is hardly reasonable
to expect the threatened vessel to submit
quietly to capture.
Hon. 'Mr. GRIESBACHI

Where a belligerent ship takes refuge in
the territorial waters of a neutral power, the
other belligerent, appearing on the scene, tas
a right to demand that the first ship shall be
expelled within twenty-four tours or else
interned. If it is not expelled or interned,
the second belligerent enters the harbour and
proceeds to deal with it, in which case the
belligerent who entered first may defend itself.
It is the o(1 story. You may have a battle
in your harbour or roadstead because of the
first breach.
If you are guilty of a breach of neutrality,
or of any neglect to enforce international law,
and another nation suffers thereby, you are
liable in damages.
I am quoting the law in order to bring home
to members of the House what our duties
reallv are. There is, of course, a whole body
of law. I think I mentioned that a belligerent
ship coming into a neutral harbour must leave
within twenty-four tours, must te expelled
within twenty-four hours, or, if not, must be
interned, the crew being taken on shore.
There is provision that a ship which comes in
owing to stress of weather may effect repairs
which will make ber seaworthy, but net warworthy. A ship which comes into a neutral
port is entitled to fuel, food and water sufficient to carry ber to her nearest tome port.
I have outlined briefly the law of neutralitv.
Before dealing with the obligation resting
upon all independent nations to maintain neutrality, let me draw attention to an aspect of
the matter which is seldom discussed, but
which is in the minds of those particularly
charged with the duty of maintaining neutrality. While you have the law clearly
before you, bear this in mind, that naval and
military commanders gain merit in their own
country when they "get away"-to use a
common expression-with an incident in connection with the maintenance of neutrality.
For example, the commander of a force of ten
thousand men moves into a neutral countrv.
The law is that te shall be immdiatelv interned. But suppose the neutral is unable to
prevent him from marching back to his own
country. He bas violated the otter countrv's
neutrality, but if te can succeed in bringing
his command back to his own country te will
gain merit and his country will stand behind
hirm. Similarly, naval officers gain merit when
they violate the neutrality of other countries
and "get away" wvith it.
I am not discussing land neutrality, or the
entirely new feature of air neutrality, upon
whichi writers are speculating, but upon which

JUNE 14, 1934
they have come to no definite conclusion except the belief that, in the main, air neutrality
will follow sea neutrality.
The obligation to maintain neutrality is
threefold. In the first place, the country which
maintains neutrality supports international
law and the comity of nations. It takes its
place as a full-grown nation able to play its
part. Capacity and willingness to maintain
neutrality are a practical contribution to the
maintenance of peace and public order.
Finally, the maintenance of neutrality is the
supreme duty of a sovereign state; it is the
test of sovereignty.
The best instance of that in modern times
is the situation which confronted the Government of Belgium in 1914. Belgium, a very
small country, it is true, was quite unable
to stand up to Germany; nevertheless, when
confronted with the proposal from the German
Government to permit the Germans to march
through to attack France, they to compensate
Belgium for all damage, the Belgians, knowing that the fate of their nation was at stake,
knowing that their position as a sovereign and
independent nation was involved, gave the
reply with which we are all familiar, and, as
a cartoon in Punch put it, Belgium "saved
her soul alive." They knew they must maintain their neutrality. There is not a shadow
of doubt that had they acquiesced in the proposal of Germany, in the peace subsequently
made Belgium would have been partitioned
and branded as a country unfit to have a
national life of its own, and as a menace
to the world. Belgium has learned her lesson,
and to-day is the most heavily armed country
in Europe, having regard to her size and
resources.
Sovereign states which cannot and will not
defend their neutrality are a menace to the
peace of the. world, and are faithless to the
civilization in which they live.
I desire to stress the fact that sovereign
nations owe it to their neighbours and to
the nations of the civilization in which they
live, to maintain their neutrality as a balancing factor between nations.
We shall come presently to the question of
how our neutrality is to be maintained. Here
again I am frequently met with the statement that we may count upon Great Britain
to assist us in the maintenance of our
neutrality. [ combat that assertion. The
policy of maintaining neutrality is a mere
extension of national policy. It is the duty
and obligation of our Government. It is a
policy which our Government must decide
and our country must carry out. We have
no right to ask the British people to assist

511

us in carrying out the policy of our Government. It is not dignified and not reasonable, and I venture the opinion that Great
Britain will be strongly disinclined to assist
us, for the reason that the various Dominions
have their own contacts and problems, and
that they must all preserve their own neutrality, and by so doing reduce the friction which
in time of war is most productive of trouble.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not like
to interrupt my honourable friend, but surely
he is not arguing that when England is at
war all her Dominions and the rest of the
Empire could possibly remain neutral. I do
not think that is open for argument.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am not discussing that. I am speaking of a war between
two other countries, the British Empire remaining neutral in all its parts. I am discussing the question whether or not we have
any right to expect assistance from Great
Britain in the maintenance of our neutrality,
the policy of our Government as announced
by proclamation at the outbreak of the war.
We are a sovereign state now. We claim the
rights of sovereignty. At the outbreak of a
war our Government will issue a proclamation
of neutrality. I submit that our Government
must maintain that neutrality by its own
resources; that we have no right to ask any
other country to assist us. To ask Great
Britain for help would be an attempt to
make her responsible for our neglect and
unwillingness to assume the full responsibilities and implications of sovereignty.
I want to draw the attention of the House
for a moment to what would be the consequences of our failure to maintain neutrality.
Various books on the subject contain interesting information. According to Birkenhead's
International Law, page 325, as already cited,
when belligerent ships unlawfully enter
neutral territory and the neutral government
does not or cannot expel them, the other
belligerent is justified in entering the neutral
territory for the purpose of preventing the
violation from operating to his disadvantage.
In other words, he may enter only on clear
grounds of self-defence and self-preservation.
Lawrence, in his Principles of International
Law, says at page 651 that when a belligerent
suffers through the failure of a neutral from
ill-will or remissness to fulfil the obligations
laid on it by international law, a valid claim
for satisfaction, or redress, arises.
Everyone is familiar with the famous case
of the Alabama, which was permitted to
escape from Great Britain and did a certain
amount of damage to American trade. As a
result of an arbitration, Great Britain was

512

SENATE

mulcted in damages to the extent of over

$15,000,000. One of the risks involved in the

failure to maintain neutrality is that the
country may have to pay heavy damages.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
In the
Alabama case the real loss was not fifteen
million cents.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. As a matter
of fact, all the money has not been paid
out yet, because claimants have never come
forward for some of it.
Lawrence points out that in very extreme
cases when the feebleness and ýfolly of a
neutral govcrnment make its ncutralitv little
better than a farce, a belligerent may Se justified, if al] other means fail, in acting as if
the neutrality did n'ot exist.
Whenever a nation Sas failed to carry out
the obligations laid upon it by international
law in relation to any situation or condition
involving neutrality, that nation invites force
as a solution of the difficulties that arise.
I come now to a discussion of some actual
cases of inability or failure of a country to
maintain neutrality as between belligerents.
In the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, after the
battle of Port Arthur, a Russian destroyer
took refuge in a Chinese port. Under international law she should have been expelled
or interned within twenty-four heurs. At the
expiration of that time the Chinese had taken
neither course, and thereupon the Japanese
entered the harbour and destroyed the Russian warship.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAJN:
coal and fresh water.

They gave thenm

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think they did.
Here is another case. After the battîe of the
Falkland Islands the German cruiser Dresden
escaped.
British warships sought for her
along the west coast of South America for the
following three months, and on the 14th of
MarcS, 1915, located Ser in Cumberland Bay,
at Juan Fernandez Island, in Chilean territory. The Chilean Government lacked the
force to intern the Dresden or to compel
her to put to sea. The British warship Kent
immediately opened fire on the Gernian ship.
Fire was returned by the Dresden, which
hauled down ber flag and despatched a boat
to H.M.S. Glasgow, the German captain seeking to open negotiations. The British captain refused to negotiate and demanded unconditional surrender. Thereupon the German captain, having put bis crew ashore, blew
up the Dresden.
The British Government
apologized to the Government of Chile for
the breach of neutrality; and the captains
of the British ships were credited with having

beiaved, under the circumstances, in a very
proper manner in the interest of thteir country. The Chilean Governrment was unable te
preserve the law of neutrality. As I said
before, belligerent governments will always
support a naval officer who gets away with
a violation of the law.
I will cite another instance. In 1863 an
American man-of-war found and captured the
Confederate vessel Chesapeake off Sambre,
a harbour of Nova Scotia. The legality of
the act was net seriously maintaintd, and the
Americans. in reply to the English complaint,
could find no better plea in law than that
the captain had acted "under the influence of
a patriotic and commendable zeal" to bring
to punishment outlaws who had offended
against the peace and dignity of both
countries.
Here is ti'h outstanding instance to be found
in international law of what happens to a
country which is unable to take a clear course
in the maintenance of neutrality. In 1807,
wlen Great Britain was at war witlh Napoleon,
the Danes had a very good fleet. It was believed that Napolnon, who was then in
Holland, was about to seize Denmark and
acquir tîat flent. The British Government
thercfore called upon the Danes to surrender
the fient. But the Danes could not make
up their minds, for the British Government
was some diŽtance away and Napoleon was
very n ar, and while they were ztill meditating
the Briti-h navy, under Nel-on, entered the
harbour of Copnhagen and after a bloody
battle captured the whole of the Danish fleet
and dcstroyttd it.
I iave drawn tdhis matter to the attention
of the House because on our Pacifie coast we
have a condition which invites trouble.
While the honourable Ieadtx on the other ride
(Hon. Ir. Dandurand) assured us the other
day that a war between the United States
and Japan iN unthinkable, I can scarcely
accept his assurance, nor do J think that this
country would be well advised to malte its
arrangements upon that assurance. It is on
thca
that the great conflict of the future
will talte place in the Pacifie. It is to be
hoped that when it comes we shall be a
neutral state, and that we shall be able to
preserve our neutrality. We have a coast-line
there whic'h extcnds about 750 miles south,
in a straight line, from the panhandle of
Ala-ka, but on account of the many indentations the actual coast-line is about three
times that length. Then there are Vancouver
Island and Queen Charlotte Island.
On
various parts of the coast are innumerable
indentations which are ntver visited, where
enemy submarines and
t'her ships could

JýUNE 14, 1934
harbour with safety. It is probably one of
the most difficuit seacoasts in the whole world
to defend or police.
It is commonly recognized that in the event
ofa confiict hetween the United States and
Japan both belligerents would for obviaus
reasoins seek to use that coa.st-]jne. Whether
they did so or not, it is clear to those who
have given any study to the Spanisýh-American
War andi the reaction of the Arnerican press
and politicians ta conditions theni prevailing,
that throughout the United States it, would
be alleged that, our Pacifie coast was being used
against thern. for enemy purposes. If we
refuse to provide the means to maintain our
neutrality we are likeýly to find ourselves in
that situation, cunfronted by public opinion
in the United States which migbt compel the
American Government to take action. That
Government might sayto us, in effect: 'You
have made and are making no .rea.sonable
provision to maintain noeutrality, and our
enemy is using your coa.sts for his purposes.
We are going to treat your neutrality as
though it did not exist. We will enter your
harbours and ports and ourselves establish
the naval forces necessary to maintain
neutrality."
In conclusion I will mention the means that
we have for maintaining neutrality. I had
occasion to refer 'to these the other day when
dealing with the matter of naval defence.
We have on eaeh of niir coasts two modemn
destroyers, which are warships of the smallest
type, two obsolete destroyers, and four or five
lightly armed trawlcrs. Let it be assumed
for the sake of argument that aIl these are
comrbined on the Pacific coast. Honourable
members can imagine how inadequate this
combined force would be. Our wireless equipment is negligible; we have no submarines
and no bydroplanes, indeed very few aircraft
of any kind. In any attempt to enforce neiitraflity, the equipment at our disposaI would
at once be seen to be absolutely inadequate.
I may be told that the Oovernment has plans
wi'th respect to the matter, but I arn positive
that no person who has any knowledge of the
proablem will for a moment say that the means
at our disposai are at aN equal ta the task.
My on]y abject at this time is to pIaoe on
record rny views on this situation. As a
sovereign state we should be made aware of
the importance of aur savereignty and our
dlaim to independence and the obligations
which these entaîl, and I urge that we should
without further deIay proceed to. put ourselves
in a position to maintain neutrality. This is
Canada's flrst and miost important duty, ncot
only to herself and to the rest of thie Empire,
74728--38

but to the whole comity of nations, that we
should be able, of ourselves and by our own
strength, ta maintain our neutrality and our
dignity as a savereign ýpower.
Han. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
menabers, I desire ta say a few words on this
subject. I arn indebted to the hanourable
gentleman from. Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbjach) for the very informative statement hie
h-as given on -the laws of neutraîity. I am. not
in a position to controvert any of bis statement, but I wish to teil him that in 1909
I supyported in this Chamnber a bill to establish a ýCanadian navy. That bill was carried,
plans were prepared for two units on the
Atlantic and the Pacific, and I think that
tenders wcre called for and receivcd.
'Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But nothing more
than that was done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Be cause the
political friends of the honourable gentleman
joined the Nationalist movement ini the province of Quebec and aroused prejudices against
a Canadian navy, on the ground that it
might be required ta take part in defensive
actions beyond our borders. The province of
Quebec was divided and the famous naval
policy of Sir Wilfrid Laurier was defeated
because of the activities of the Nationalist
pamty, headed by Mr. Bourassa and supported
by Mr. Monk, which pamty was ini turn supported by the maney of the Conservative
party, hcadcd by Sir Robert Borden; and
for that affirmation I have the wmitten statement of Sir Hugh Graham, who h4iself
furnished the maney, or part of it. The
Nationalists won the day. In the House of
Commons, at the following session of Parliament--I do not know whether my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
was there-S-ir George Eulas Foster asked
who really won. The Nationalist party had
in fact becn merged with the Canservative
party.
That is why the naval policy was not
carried out. Now my bonourable friend urges
the strengthening of aur naval defences. I
draw bis attention ta the fact that when a
party bas gone down to defeat on a certain
policy it is consoling ta fi.nd itself vindicated
by subsequent events. I arn sure that na one
would dare rise in this Chamber ta dlaimi

Government for a Canadian navy was nat

satisfactorily, but were unable to come back
to the surface. I will not discuss that feature,
for my purpose at this point is merely ta
show that the Laurier Government's plans of
1909 were vindicated by the events of 1914.
I suggest to my honourable friend from
Edmonton that it may possibly become necessary ta revive Sir Wilfrid Laurier's naval
policy, although the present situation differs
from that of 1909. In those days the European horizon was darkened with war clouds,
which in the meantime have disappeared. It
may be said that the German navy aiso bas
disoppeared. My honourable friend warns us
that war may at some time break out on the
Pacifie. That is possible. But I wonder
whether, in view of the present financial situation, the Government of the day would declare its readiness to formulate a naval policy
similar to that of 1909, which was justified in
1914, but which may not be necessary in 1934.

an answer.
NATURAL PRODUCTS MARKETING
BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill 51, an Act to improve
the methods and practices of marketing of
natural products in Canada and in export
trade, and to make further provision in connection therewith.
Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable members, I read carefu'lly the proceedings on this
measure in the other Chamber, and I may say
at once that the principle underlying the
measure is repugnant to the Liberal school of
thought in economics. The basic and essential
principle of that se'hool of thought is freedom for every individual to dispose of the
product of his labour as he deems fit. The
governients that have directed the affairs
of this country since 1867 have in various ways
constantly endeavoured ta improve the lot of
the former by initiating legislation with respect ta the inspection and grading of various
exportable products, by establishing experimental farms, and by providing transportation faci'lities. The consumer bas also been
protected by legislation against combines and
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

price fixing, in an effort ta maintain competition throughout the land. Up ta the
present time the producer's sole guide bas
been the market price for his product. It bas
been his barometer for expansion and contraction. The provincial governments have
also passed legislation to promote better
marketing of products by encouraging cooperative societies. But in all the legislation,
federal and provincial, I do not think you can
point ta anytbing savouring of coercion.
By this Bill an effort is made to substitute
the principle of compulsion for the principle of competition-the absolute freedom of
the individual ta dispose of the product of
his labour. This is the most radical legislation ever submitted ta Parliament, and tends
ta the socialization of industry. To my utter
surprise, it is sponsored by a Conservative
Government.
I have been trying ta divine the genesis of
this Bill. It may be said that the Imperial
Parliament bas recently passed similar legislation. But I recall that the Minister of
Agriculture and the Prime Minister are both
fron the West, and I am forced ta the conclusion that the Bill is inspired by the Western Provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Leader
of the Opposition also comes from the West.
Yes, but he

the right honourable Prime Minister.
He just

He may ta

some extent have imbibed the ideas of the
West, but not to the extent of absolutely
blurring his principles.
Why do I say that this Bill probably
originated in the West? Because the West
produces few natural products compared with
the number produced by the Eastern Provinces. I sec prominently in the foreground
the wheat pools. I speak subject ta correction, but I understand that to-day the
wheat pools do not control more than forty
per cent of the wheat growers. Is there
behind this Bill a desire on the part of the
directors of the wheat pools ta regulate wheat?
We know that already it is being regulated
in various ways. Of course, the farmers of
the West raise a great many cattle, but I
wonder if this instrument is not intended to
bring about a unified movement in the Prairie
Provinces in order that wheat may be
marketed under a singile organization.
I am under the impression that this proposed legislation will be inapplicable ta the

by supplementary legislation.
It seems to the Council that there are two
main principles applied in Bill No. 51. First,
the granting to a "reasonable number" of those
interested in a particular commodity in a
special district, the right to coerce the
remainder of those so interested. The rights of
individuals to control and dispose of their own
property, and the rights of minorities, have
always been jealously guarded under our
political and legal systems. The Agricultural
Marketing Act of Great Britain, which is said
to have served as a model for Bill No. 51,
recognizes and respects these ,two classes of
rights. The British Act requires not only that
the Minister of the Department satisf y himself
as to the reasonableness of any "development"
scheme put forward by an interested group,
but the whole scheme, together with the
evidence upon which the Minister bas based
his judgment, must be laid before both Houses
of Parlianent. The most complete publicity
is also provided for with regard to these
schlemes. and in certain cases a system of

ing of natural and other products. The Council
considers that the principle of governmental
intervention in industry and commerce, which
would be extended by the legisiation under consideration, is one that should flot be lightly
admittecl.
The interests of domestic consumers have
not, in the Council's opiin reeved sufficient consideration in ihNo. 51. The British
Agricultural Marketing Act pays much more
attention to this feature, and this fact is
respectfully urged upon your consideration.
Consumners of our products abroad, resenting
any Government control, which may affect
prices, will undoubtedly take steps to protect
their own intereats, ta the detriment of Canadian producers and exporters.
In making these suggestions and criticies,
the Council wishes to assure you, air, that it
has been motivated *by a spirit of helpfulness
and flot one of mere critîcism.
1 have the honour to be, sir,
Your obedient servant,
J. Stanley Cook,
Secretary.
Then I corne to the question put by the
Monrtreal Gazette: If Canada appears ta be
on the up grade, why this new legisiation,
ivbich is of formidable consequence and purely
experimental?
As the right honourable
gentleman said yesterday, its purpose is ta
raiso and stabilize price-to inorcase the
price of the product which will be regulated.
1 cati the attention of this Chamber ta the
experience of our neighhours to the Eouth.
Under the N.R.A. four bundred codes, and
more, govern twenty-one million people;
prices are fixed, and an attempt is made to
stabiliîe them. But we have an officiai statement from We.shington that the N.R.A. bas
been a failuce. Why? Because rules and
codes have been disregarded. So codes are
abandoned and renounced, even including
those wlhich provide that no sale shall be
made below cost. This shows that the experiment on the other side of the line feul
far short of success.
1 applauded the Prime Minist-er when, more
than once, on his return from Europe, hie
declared against the policies wbich were being
promulgated by the President of the United
States, thus leading us to conclude that hie
did not deemn it Wise te take a.ny step in
that direction until the American experiment
had succeeded. Yet, just when that experiment is officîally recognized as a failure, the
present measure is introduced into this
Chamber. Again I put the question: Why
is this legislation brought forward at this
stage, and under theee eircumstances?
I need not stress tihe faet that where freedomn
disa.ppears tyranny is often enthroned on the
morrow.
The British Act, which in soine respects has
been copied. in this Act, provides for boards
of arbitrators te whom imroducers or consum-

517

ers may appeal. Our Prime Minister stated
that there must be interference on behaif
of those who, unless they speak collectively,
cannot speak at ail. But, I askc honourable
gentlemen, what about tihe consumer? AIthough the whole of our population is composed of consumers, the consumer is not
mentioned in this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Oh, yes; in
the second part.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But not s0
clearly or so deifinitely as in the British Act.
Altbough our wbole population is made up
of consumners, yet the consumer la confront cd,
as my right honourable friend re-cognized
yestcrday, by an attempt to raise prices; and
price raising naturally means the raising of
prices against the consumer. I recognize the
importance of the producer receiving a living
wage, or a fair return for whatever bie produces, but in the past hie bas been the sole
judgce of what and bow muclh hie should produce, and in what market hie sbould dispose
Of it.

Like President Hoover, who during his
terni of office ra.ised the tariff ta new beights,
and declared when hie was going to the people,
and aftcrwards, that lie stood for higli salaries,
and like President Roosevelt, who under his
N.R.A. seheme insisted upon shorter hours
of labour and higher wages. the present Gevernment of Canada raised its tariff sky-high.
But neither the Hoover administration, nor
the Roosevelt administration, for thc present
Government of this country bas attained the
desired end. Our exports and imports have
continued ta dwindle. It is interesting te
note how tbey have shrunk since 1930. Yct,
when President Roosevelt abandons his policy
of price fixing, aur Government enters the
field. Again 1 put the question: Why do
this if conditions are improving?
I cite Mr. Hirst's article, which appeared in
the Contemporary Review of March, and part
cal which la reproduced in tibe Montreal
Gazette. That article says:
Star chamber devices have lately obtained in
Great Britain; large instalments of protection
andf Socialiai have been introduced and put
into effect by Orders in Council.
Some of the features of such a star chamber
policy are te be f ound in tbc present Bill,
for it is sought te delegate to the Governor
in Council powers whi6h will allow him, in
lieu of Parliament, te legislate on questions
of economics, questions of imports and experts, and questions of tariff.
The first duty of Parliament is te legislate,
and te control legislation, on matters of
economy wbich affect the wbole financiaî
fabrie of the country. It is the essence of

518

SENATE

the power of Parliament to vote supply, to
levy taxes, to devise ways and means. All
these questions of finance are involved in
this Bill; and by it very many of Parliament's powers are transferred to the Governor
in Council. I say this is unorthodox. It
smacks of Fascism, for Parliament is no longer
master of its financial laws, its tariff laws, or
its customs laws. Tiey are delegated to
the Governor in Council. It is dangerous,
because, t·iis being star chamber legislation,
there vill be a natural tendency to answer
sectional appeals. When such appeals come
before Parliament the whole country is made
aware of what is going on. On this side of
the House-and, I am quite sure, on the
other side as well-voluntary association and
co-operation among the producers of natural
products are welcome, but the principle of
compulsion involved in this Bill is not.
Can the provisions of this Bill be applied
tiroughout the country? As I have said, I
doubt very much that they can be applied
in the East. Also, I doubt very much that
they can be applied in the West. I am told
that the Western farmer would resent coercion. I see the trouble the Bill will create,
and I am fearful of the result.
I opened my remarks by stating that
Liberalism is opposed to such autocratie
power and such authority being given to
local boards. I bad thougbt this measure
probably originated in the West; yet the
Minister of Agriculture stated that in his
opinion this regulation of products, especially
of wheat, would not enhance prices for the
producer. Local boards may spring up m
many districts to dictate to the farmer how
and wLen be may dispose of bis products.
This is more than advanced Socialisn. Under
clause 4 the Bill before us gives the Board
definite powers. I suppose tiat every member of this Chamber lias read tiat clause,
but I want each of them to ask himself how
it will be received by the people in bis
community.
At 6 p.m. the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is what the
Board will be empowered to do, under section 4:
(a) to regulate the time and place at which,
and to designaté the agency through which the
regulated product shall be nmarketed, to determine the manner of distribution, the quantity
and quality, grade or class of the regulated
produet that shall be marketed by any person
at any time, and to prohibit the marketing of
any of the regulated product of any grade,
quality or class;
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

(b) to exempt from any determination or
order any person or class of persons engaged
in the production or marketing of the regulated
produet or any class, variety or grade of such
product;
(c) to conduct a pool for the equalization
of returns received from the sale of the regulated product; to compensate any person for
loss sustained by withholding from the market
or forwarding to a specified market any regulated product pursuant to an order of the
Board; provided that no compensation shall be
paid in respect of a regulated product that
may be withheld from a particular market
because the grade of such product is deemed
by the Board to be unsuitable for such market,
or bcause of restrictions inposed by the Government or other competent authority of any
other country upon the importation of any
regulated product into that country;
(ci) to compensate any person in respect of
any shipment made pursuant to any determination or order of the Board to a country whose
nurrency is depreciated, in relation to Canadian
currency, for loss due to such depreciation;
t
(e) bo assis by grant or loan the construetion or operation of facilities for preserving,
processing, storing, or conditioning the regulated product and to assist research work
relating to the marketing of such product.
That paragraph e causes me to wonder to
what exteont the federal authorities will be
going into business and replacing banks, whici
are organized for financing bhe construction
and operation of facilities such as are referred
to here. I have known of many instances
where institutions that assisted by grant or
loan the construction or operation of such
facilities were obliged later on to take possession of the facilities in order to save moneys
tiat had been advanced. The question occurs
to me whether the Government, after having
made certain grants or loans, will not find it
necessary to become the owners of businesses
whicb they have helped to create.
The section goes on to state these further
powers of the Board:
(f) to require any or all persons engaged
iu the production or marketing of the regulated product to register their names, addresses
and occupations with the Board, or to obtain
a licence from the Board, and such licence shall
bc subject to cancellation by the Board for
violation of any provision of this Act or regulation made thereunder;
(g) to require full information relating to
the production and marketing of the natural
product fron all persons engaged therein and
to require periodic returns to be made by such
persons, and to inspect the books and premises
of such persons.
Subsection 2 of the same section reads:
(2) Whenever a scheme for regulation by a
local board bas been approved, the Board may
authorize the local board to exercise such of
the powers of the Board as are outlined in
this section and as may be necessary for the
proper enforcement of the scheme of regulation. and may at any time withdraw from the

local board authority to exercise any of its
powers.

JUNE 14, 1934
And subsections 4 to 8 provide:
(4) The Board, whether exercising the
powers conferred by this Act or by provincial
legislation, may establish a separate fund in
connection with any scheme of regulation and
for the purposes of such scheme may impose
charges and tolls in respect of the marketing
of the whole or any part of the regulated
product, which charges and tolls shall be payable by such persons engaged in the production or marketing of the regulated product as
the Board decides.
(5) Whenever a local board bas been authorized to exercise any of the powers of the Board,
the Board may authorize such local board to
act as its agent to collect and disburse the
charges or tolls imposed.
(6) Whenever the Board or a local board
co-operates or acts conjointly with any board
or agency established under the law of any
province to regulate the marketing of any
natural product, the Board may similarly
impose charges or tolls in respect of the marketing of the whole or any part of the product
marketed under the direction of such board or
agency, and may authorize such board or
agency to act as the agent of the Board in
collecting and disbursing such charges or tolls.
(7) A fund created by charges or tolls
imposed in connection with a scheme of regulation may be utilized by the Board or by
the local board if so authorized by the Board,
for the purposes of such scheme including the
creating of reserves, and in the case of charges
or tolls imposed in respect of the marketing of
any product under the direction of any, oard
or agency established under the law of any
province to regulate the marketing of any
natural product, the Board may direct that the
charges or tolls be utilized by and for the
purposes of such board or agency.
(8) Any charge or toll imposed by the Board
pursuant to this section shall be a debt due
to the Board, recoverable by legal action, and
a certifneate under the hand of a chief executive officer of the Board or of the local board,
or board or agency established under the law
of any province to regulate the marketing of
any natural product, as the case may be, acting
as agent of the Board as herein provided, shall
be prima facie evidence that the amount stated
therein is due.
I have read most of section 4 in order that
we may visualize what will be the state of
mind of the thousands of people who do not
join in the request for a local board and who
will be drawn against their will into this
scheme, forced to take out a licence, dictated
to in the matters of time and place of marketing, distribution, quantity and quaility, and
obliged to pay a tax for the operations of such
local board and the regulation of their producte. I wonder whether the Government
will seriously consider imposing such limitations on the right of a man to dispose as he
pleases of his own goods, the product of his
own labour, and compelling him to join in
a pool which will receive the money for his
goods and assess him with certain charges.
Frankly I doubt that section 4 wili meet
with the approval of any farming community.
It may be satisfactory to persons who are

519

desirous of joining a co-operative organization, but I think that all others will feel their
freedom has gone and that they have been
placed under a tyrannical system from which
they must try to liberate themselves at the
first opportunity. Therefore I wonder whether
this legislation is not window dressing, which
looks attractive to those who do not examine
it carefully. It may be that all the producers
and marketers of a few classes of goods will
be agreeable to coming under such a scheme,
but I doubt not that in my province and in
Ontario and the Maritimes great numbers of
people will claim that this legislation has
deprived them of their freedom.
The right honourable leader was not sure
that in Great Britain it is necessary that any
such scheme must obtain the sanction of Parliament before coming into operation. I would
direct his attention to subsection 8 of section
1 of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931,
which reads:
(8) If the Minister, after making such
modifications (if any) as aforesaid, is satisfied
that the scheme will conduce to the more
efficient production and marketing of the
regulated product, he may, after consultation
with the Board of Trade, lay before each
House of Parliament a draft of the scheme,
and if each House resolves that the scheme
shall be approved, the Minister shall make an
order approving the scheme in terms of the
draft, and the scheme shall (subject to the
provisions of the Act) come into force on such
date after the date of the passing of the laat
of such resolutions of approval as may be
specified in the order, and the making of the
order shall be conclusive evidence that the
requirements of this Act have been complied
with and that the order and the scheme
approved thereby have been duly made and
approved and are within the powers conferred
by this Act.
My right honourable friend has dirawn
my attention to the fact that the interest of
the consumer is taken care of in Part Il,
under the title of Investigations. I find the
following sections:
17. (1) The Minister may, at the request of
the Board or upon his own initiative, authorize
an investigation into the cost of production,
wages, prices, spread, trade practices, methods
of financing, management policies, grading,
transportation and' other matters in relation to
the production and marketing, adaptation for
sale, processing or conversion of any natural or
regulated product.
(2) The Minister may also require persons
engaged in the production or marketing,
adaptation for sale, processing or conversion of
any natural or regulated product to submit at
regular intervals or at any stated time, information demanded by the Minister in connection with the matters referred to in subsection
one hereof.
18. (1) Whenever as a result of any such investigation the Minister shall have reason to
believe that such a situation exista as requires
further inquiry he may at the request of the

SENATE
Board or on his own initiative appoint a committee to inquire into the spread in connection
with the marketing, adaptation for sale, processing or conversion of a natural or regulated
product.
Then a committee is appointed.
19. (1) A committee shall have power to
investigate ail operations occurring in connection with or in the course of marketing...
(2) For the purposes of any such investigation or inquiry the Minister or such person as
he may authorize to act on his behalf and the
committee shall have the powers of a commissioner appointed under the Inquiries Act.
20. A committee may after investigation as
hereinbefore provided report to the Minister
in connection with any operation occurring in
the course of marketing. adaptation for sale,
processing or conversion of the natural or regulated product, whether, in its opinion, the
spread received is detrinental to or against
the interest of the public in that it is excessive or results in undue enhancement of prices
or otherwise restrains or injures trade or
commerce in the natural or regulated product.
Then the report is published. Section 22
provides that
Every person who, to the detriment or
against the interest of the public, charges,
receives or attempts to receive any spread
which is excessive or results in undue enhancement of prices or otherwise restrains or injures
trade or commerce in the natural or regulated
product, shall be guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to a penalty not exceeding five thousand dollars or te two years' imprisonment, or,
if a corporation, to a penalty not exceeding ten
thousand dollars.
Section 23 provides:
(1) Whenever in the opinion of a committee
an offence has been committed against this
Part, the Minister shall remit to the AttorneyGeneral of any province within which such
alleged offence shall have been committed, for
sucb action as sucb Attorney-General may be
pleased to institute, the evidence taken on any
investigation by a committee and the report of
the committee.
(2) If within three months after remission
aforesaid, or within such shorter period as the
Governor in Council shall decide, no such action
shall have been taken by or at the instance
of the Attorney-General of the province as to
the Governor in Council the case seems in the
public interest to require, the AttorneyGeneral of Canada may permit an information
to be laid against such person or persons as
in the opinion of the Attorney-General shall
have been guilty of an offence against this
Part.
Nowhere do I see that the consumer has
an opportunity to protest, except by petitioning his member of Parliament or the
Minister himself. This, to my mind, is far
removed from the safeguards that are to be
found in the British Agricultural Marketing
Act of 1931. By subsection 1 of section 9
of that Act it is provided:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The Minister shall appoint two committees
(hereinafter in this Act referred to as "a
consumers' committee" and "a commnittee of
investigation") for Great Britain, England and
Scotland respectively.
Subsection 2 provides that a consumers'
committee shall:
(a) consist of a chairman and of not less
than six other members, who shall be such
persons as appear to the Minister, after consultation with the Board of Trade and, as to
one member, with the Co-operative Union, to
represent the interests of the consumers of all
the products the marketing of which is for the
time being regulated by schemes approved by
the Minister; and
(b) be charged with the duty of considering
and reporting to the Minister on(i) the effect of any scheme approved by
the Minister, which is for the time being in
force, on consumers of the regulated product;
and
(ii) any complaints 'made to the committee
as to the effect of any such scheme on consumers of the regulated product.
Sibsection 3 iprovides that a committee of
investigation shall:
(a) consist of a chairman and four other
members; and
(b) be charged with the duty, if the Minister in any case so directs, of considering, and
reporting to the Minister on, any report made
by a consumers' committee and any complaint
made to the Minister as to the operation of
any scheme whiich, in the opinion of the Minister, could not be considered by a consumers'
committee under the last foregoing subsection.
Subsection 5 provides:
If a committee of investigation reports to the
Minister that any provision of a scheme or any
act or omission of a board admninistering a
scheme is contrary to the interest of consumers
of the regulated product, or is contrary to the
interest of any persons affected by the scheme
and is not in the public interest, the Minister,
if be tbinks fit so to do after considering the
report and consulting the Board of Trade(a) may by order make such amendments in
the scheme as be considers necessary or
expedient for the purpose of rectifying the
matter;
(b) may by order revoke the scheme.
Then subsection 6:
In considering for the purpose of this Act
whbether any person represents the interest of
consumners of any product, or whether any
provision of a scheme or any act or omission
of the board administering a scheme is contrary to the interests of consumers of any
product, regard shall be had to the interests
of persons who purchase the product. or commodities produced wholly or partly therefrom,
for their own consumption or use and not to
the interests of persons who purchase the
product, or such commodities as aforesaid, for
the purpose of any trade or industry carried
on by them.
I find also that by the Imperial Statute of
1933, Chapter 31, 23 and 24 George V, power

JIJNE 14, 1934
is given to regulate tbe importation of agricultural products and sales of bome-produced
agricultural products. Tbe statute also gives
the Government tbe rigbt to regulate tbe importation of these products. I quote subsection 3 of section 1:
In deciding whether to make an order under
this section, and in settling the terms of any
such order, the Board of Trade shail, among
other considerations, have regard to the intereet of consumers of the produet to which
the order relates (including persons who purchase that product for the purpose of subjecting it to any treatment or process of manufacture) and to the effect which the regulation
of the importation of that product into the
United Kingdom ie likely to have upon commercial relations between the United Kingdom
and other countries; and the Board shall not
make sucb an order unless they are satisfied
that it is not at variance with any treaty,
convention or agreement for the time being in
force between Hie Majesty and any foreign
Power or between His Majesty'e Government
in the United Kingdom and the government of
any other country.
These provisions contained in the Imperial
statutes of 1931 and 1933 show wbat consideration was gîven to the interests of consumers, and bow tbey may submit their
grievances to a committee appointed for
their protection, called the Consumers' Committee. There is notbing in tbis Bill to
indicate how the consumer may approach tbe
authorities to lay -bis grievance before the
central board or a local board. I submit tbat
the provisions in the British statutes for the
reception of grievances from consumners sbould
bave been incorporated, since tbese statutes
were before tbe Government wben the Bill
was prepared.
It seems to me tbat tbe whole scheme
needs considerable revision in order to elimmnate ahi provisions coercive of the farming
community. I submit further that the powers
given to the Governor in Couneil sbould remain in tbe bande of Parliament.
Hon. A. B. GIIJS: Honourable senators,
it wouhd be presumption on my part te
attempt to reply te the honourable leader on
the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) - He
stated more tban once tbat the Bihl bad ite
genesis in tbe Western Provinces. I do net
tbink it will be possible te find witbin the
four corners of tbe proposed legishation anything te justify such a conclusion. It is
true that we in Western Canada hope te,
benefit hargely when the Bill goes into effect.
A similar hope is entertained in other sections of the Dominion. Therefore tbis is
not in any sense legislation for the exclusive
benefit of the Western Provinces.
1 have been for many years interested in
farming operations in Western Canada. For

521

this reason I feel I should discuss the proposed legisiation, which I consider of great
importance, not only to the Prairie Provinces,
but to the whole Dominion.
For several weeks thîs Bill was before the
Commons and an attempt was made by certain critics to -tear it almost ta shreds, but
only a few minor ohanges were actually made,
and these do not affect its principle.
The support given the Bill i the Commons
My honourable friend
was outstanding.
opposite says it is to a large extent a Western measure. It is true that although the
party with w.hich he is affiliated opposed
the Bill, one of its mem-bers representing a
constituency in Western Canada voted in it8
favour.
It bas been said that the Bill enýdangers
the Constitution and usurps the functions of
Parliament. This old story has always been
brought forward wben ne legitima-te arguments could be advanced. We have heard
it on more than one occasion, but our Constitution and the powers of Parliament remain
intact. Somewbat similar objections were
raised when the Government sought the socalled blank cheque to extend relief to distressed people throughout the Dominion.
Much time was wasted, but in the end the
Bill was passed and relief was extended to
those who so sorely needed it. The Constitution was not disturbed, neither were the
functions of Parliament impaîred.
AIl these fears about the impairment of
the Constitution and the rights of Parliament are without foundation. What does the
f armer care, about argument on constitutional rights while bis products are worth
next to nothing? He knows that the Constitution is safe, and is in no way prejudiced
by the Bill; but he d'oes hope it may prove
a measure of relief and enable him to secure
a more equitable return for his commodities.
There is no way by whicb one country can
compel anot-her to buy its produets. Sale
can . be effected only when the producing
country bas produets which another country
wants, and which are purchasable at fair
prices. Since tbe War the export trade bas
been subjected to ohanged conditions almost
the world over. Nearly every nation of any
consequence has gone on the defensive,
adopting the policy of increaising its own
production and preventing competitors from
unduly invading its home market. Tbat
policy of restriction is becoming almost universal, and in consequence producers bave
been finding it harder and barder to dispose
of their surplus production. Neigbbourîng
countries do not want those surpluses. Tbeir
objective to-day is to supply tbemselves as
far as tbey possibly can.

522

SENATE

England, where for well-nigh a century what
is called free trade was a religion, is to-day
an outtanding example of what I have just
referred to. An entire change of heart has
taken place in regard to trade competition
and protection of home interests. But England secs the tremendous possibilities of expansion of mutual trading within the nations
of the Empire, and is gladly joining hands
with the Dominions.
The producers in the Western Provinces of
Canada have had to iearn a bitter lesson.
In the good old days in the W'est very few
people gave thought to the morrow of grain
restriction. Every one was planning on enlargement of crop. No one could sec any
reason for fearing that the world market would
ever be over-supplied. Our people went on
and on increasing the areas of production,
rejoicing in added millions of bushels of wheat
year after year. And this ambition, as honourable members know, was tremendously stimulated by the Great War. But after the War
came the days of trouble. We of the West
have learned that other countries can grow
large quantities of grain. We have learned
that they can sell that grain in the markets of
tihe world as well as we can, that they are
selling it, and that inasmuch as there is more
grain than the world needs, some people have
to suffer. Everv country cannot sell as much
grain as it would like to sell. Canadian
grain growers find thernselves confronted with
that relentless fact. They have the grain,
but people do net want it; therefore, instead
of being shipped to the once open markets
at good prices, it is either sold at losing prices
or not at all.

A to the marketing of grain, we have the
Grain Commission, which handles our product
very well and looks after the interests of the
grain growers generally, without causing any
particular trouble. In addition we have a
a gentleman looking after the interests of the
Grain Pool. Mr. McFarland, who is regarded
as one of the ablest men connected with the
grain trade of this country. I would net for
a moment suggest deleting grain marketing
froni the Bill, but so far as grain is concerned the operation of the Bill may not
be necessarv to any great extent.
J repeat the simple truth that I mentioned
at the beginning. There is no way by which
we can compel other people to buy our
products. This is truc of every nation in
the world. We have next door to us neighbours who pride themselves upon being a
self-contained nation.
They have rigidly
maintained a closed door against products
which might compete against their own home
lon. Mr. GILLIS.

production. We, as Canadians, were always
willing to make fair trade agreements with
our neighbours to the south; but it is our
experience that our neighbours will not make
an agreement unless they are satisfied that
the balance of profit is sure to be on their
sidc. On more than one occasion the Government of Canada was desirous of making a
trade agreement with our neighbours, but
found that unless they had a positive advantage there could be no agreement.
Consequently, in 1930, the King Government turned their back on our neighbours
and fixed their hopes on Empire countries.
They raised their tariff against the United
States and proclaimed that for an expansion
of Canadian trade they intended te look to
the markets of the Empire. Why they should
in these latter days belittle that wise policy,
I confess I am unable to understand.
The advent to power of the present Government in 1930 was followed by an epochal
Empire event, the holding of an Empire trade
conference in the city of Ottawa, and the
making of trade agreements between the
United Kingdom and the Dominions of the
Commonwealth. Under those agreements the
channels of Empire trade have been dug wide
and deep, and they give us warranty of
permanency, stability and expansion of trade
with the Empire countries. Already we sec
the fruits of those agreements. We are selling greatly increased quantities of ouri products to Empire countries, and at the sane
time we are increasing substantially our sales
of products to foreign markets. In the last
twelve months we have increased our sales
to twenty-two Empire countries to the extent
of fifty-five million dollars, and during the
same period we have increased our sales to
fifty-six foreign countries to the extent of
forty-nine million dollars.
After the Empire trade agreements were
made further conferences of tihe nations of
the world were held in London, and the
Prime Minister of Canada took the lcad in
bringing the grain producing nations to an
agreement under which this country is assured
of a market for a fair percentage of the
world's requirements. If it were not for that
grain conference and the resultant agreement,
Canada's grain growers would be left to take
their chances in the cut-throat competition
which is certain to prevail in the grain
markets of the world. Canada's grain growers
owe a great debt of gratitude to Mr. Bennett.
Now the Government of the day are making another step forward. They see that the
producers of naturail products are at grave
disadvantage in marketing those products, and
in a spirit of helpfulness have placed before

JUNE 14, 1934
Parliament the Marketing Bill which is now
under consideration by this House. It may
not be a perfect measure, but it is a well
intended effort to help producers. That something should be attempted is universally conceded. The Government, therefore, are not
holding back. They are displaying the courage
needed in existing conditions for the breaking
in of new ground and the pioneer work of
opening up new avenues of administration and
co-operation.
The foundation principae of the Marketing
Bill is the co-operation of producers. The Bill
declares that wherever and whenever the producers of na:tural products desire the cooperation of Government it will be available.
It also provides for co-operation between the
Government of the Dominion and the governments of the respective provinces; and, I believe, enabling and supporting legislation has
been passed by nearly all the provincial legislatures. This fact indicates beyond question
that the people at large look with favour on
the Marketing Bill and are eager to give it a
trial, because they feel the need of such legislation.
While our world trade has been making progress that is encouraging, we have to realize
that a good deal remains that might be done
to assist the producers of natural products.
Quality, quantity and orderly distribution play
a large part in the marketing of such products. It is believed that much can be donc
to help the producers by co-ordination and
co-operation, and that the wasteful practices
of unhealthy competition can be materially
lessened. The Marketing Bill is directed towards the regulation of production and against
disorderly distribution, the consequent flooding of markets, and the depression of prices.
It is a call to producers to go into counsel
with one another and by the development of
a sane spirit of co-operation to regulate their
business in such a way that there may be
opportunity and advantage to all who are
interested in the production of the respective
classes of naturail products.
I note the fact that it is not intended to
lump all natural products into one administrative class. Each class of products wilil be
dealt with separately, if the Bill becomes
operative, and the producers of each class
will be given the opportunity, if they so desire,
of invoking the aid of the system which tihe
Bill will set up. In other words, it wifl be
open to the people interested in the respective
classes of natural products to invite the
Marketing Board to consider the prudence of
applying the law to their products. The Bill
further provides that while the Marketing
Board may insist on applying the law, the

523

initiative is with the producers, and they will
be consulted. The Marketing Board wfl not
be likely to apply the law unless there are
urgent reasons for such action.
When the producers in their respective lines
agree, there will be wholesome regulation of
production and distribution of products, and
this will prevent, or at least moderate, the
conditions which have prevailed in distribution and marketing, and thereby producers
will be helped to obtain better returns for
what they have to sel. This Bill, it is hoped,
will be of great value to all the people engaged in grain growing or in other farming
pursuits.
The people in Eastern Canada are more
fortunately situated than those in the West,
because they are closer to the industrial
centres af the country. Those centres help to
provide a market for their products. In Western Canada, of course, we all engage in agriculture; -consequently there are no industries
of any account in that part of the country,
and our markets are somewhat limited. For
severail years the farmers of the prairies have
been working under great difficulties. In recent
years prices offered for their products at home
and abroad have been so low that it has
been hardly worth wihile taking them to
market. Of course conditions are somewhat
better to-day than they have been, owing to
the change that has taken place in the value
of products. Su-ch products as butter and
eggs have at times been sold to cold storage
plants, and held by them for several months
until markets improved. This gave the cold
storage plants some advantage, but did not
enable the producers to realize any increase
in value or return.
I feel assured that under this Bill, provided
the producers get together and co-operate with
one another and with the governments, and
fairly carry out the conditions which the Bill
enacts, there will be substantial advantage to
them all. The producers must be willing to
help themselves. If they do that the governments will back them up. I stress the fact,
which is outstanding, that the policy embodied in this Bill is a practical effort on the
part of the Government to give support and
tangible assistance to the farming industry of
this country.
It is almost universally agreed that the time
is ripe for opening up new avenues of administrative activity. This is not a time to stand
still or to be fearful about the breaking in
of new ground in governmental administration. It is time for reasoned advancement
along well-considered lines which may benefit
the producers of our natural products.

524

SENATE

The Bill has been examined and viewed
from every possible angle in another place.
As it is something new in administrative life,
naturally some people are suspicious of it.
But I arn satisfied that the great mai ority
of Canadian prodîîcers are favourably impressed by the possibilities of national benefits
coming out of the Bill. And when it is
observed that nearly al provincial governments are expressing willingncss to co-operate
with the Dominion Govcrnment and the producers, it is open to one to conclude that the
people of the country generally want a trial
of the principles embodicd in the proposed
legislation.
Upon analysing the objections which bave
been made to the Bill, it will be seen that they
resolve themselves into nothing more than
alarm by reason of the fact the Bill breaks
new ground. The need of some constructive
action is frecly concedcd by those who criticize
and object to the Bill. But, having criticized
and objected, they stop short; not one of
them is prepared to suggest an alternative
measure.
It is very interesting to observe the ncwborn zeal of the Montreal Board of Trade,
itsg fear that public money may bc used to
help the farmers of the country in their present distrcssful condition, and its demand that
private enterprisc shaîl be the only fountain
of assistance for those farmerq. In tbis connection I want to quote a paragraph of a
circular letter read this afternoon by the leader
of the opposition, issued by the Montreal
Board of Trade to honourable membrrs of the
Senate, and, I assume. to honeurahle mcmbers of the flouse of Commons. This letter
indicates that the Board af Trade is opposzed
to the Marketing Bill. The iparagraph to,
which I refer is this:
The Couricil believes that it is bighly objectionable for the Dominion, eithcr directly or
through the MUarketing Board, to use public
funds foi, the provision of facilities for preserx ing. storing or conditioning of regulated
prodiiets.
Stich facilities, wlien necessary,
should ho provided by private enterprise. and
the revenues of the coiuntry should not be
burdened' by grants or boans, or by direct
investmnent ie sucb matters.
It bas not always been thus with the
Montreal Board of Trade. Where wvas that
organization when the stupendous load of debt
was as.sumed for unnecessary railways-a load
under which the taxpayers are now staggering?
What was their attitude then? Did they
obleet to these extraordinary expenditures? I
understand that they actually encouraged the
Government of the day in this regard. Montreal is the hast place where one would expect
Hou. Mr. GILLIS.

to find opposition to the expenditure of money
on a scheme that is expcctcd to help the
farmers of Canada. 1 do not think that any
part of the ceuntry bas been dealt with more
generously than that city in the matter of
public expenditure.
In this connection I wvould refer hionourable members to a return that was laid on
the Table of this flouse a few days ago. Lt
shows that millions upon millions of dollars
were spent in connection with Montreal barbour. I arn net going to cite the figures bere.
They are open for inspection.
In rnoving for the return 1 omitted to, ask
for particulars relating to the Montreal
terminais. It will be remembered by many
memýbers od this Chamber that when the
scheme was first con.sidered, the National
Railways-no doubt backed by the Montreal
Board of Trade--sent
te Parliament a
miniature outline of the proposcd new
terminais, showing the properties that had to
be acquired-stations, frcight-sheds and a.pproaches fromn various directions. It was a
marvellous projeet. Very likely another hotel
was to be built, because tihat was a time
when the building of hotels with publie money
was, very miîch in vogue. It was e,-timated
that thr' cozst of the proposcd new trrminals
wo-uld be in the neighbourbood of $50,000,000.
Propertieýs were purchased and a conîýiderable
excavation was made. Up te the end of 1933
the cost of t'his undertaking to the taxpayers
of Canada amounted to $16,381.000.
What
is there nowv to show for this hugP outlay?
Nothing but a hole in the ground, wbich mars
the beauty of a section of the city. Fortuinatcly, the present Government put an end
to the seherne, and notbing has been donc
for several years, nor is anything likely to
be donc for gencrations to cerne. Montreal
is sufficicntly well. equipped with railway
terminais for its requirements.
Did the
Mentreal Board of Trade object te this
expenditure?
There is no record of thieir
uttering one word in opposition to this
trernendous outlay, yet they objcct very
strenuously, as9 indicated fromn the letter which
I bave quotcd, te the expenditure of any
money in aid of tbe basic industry cf Canada.
More than flfty per cent of the entire
population of Canada is engaged in agriculture. Surely the Montreal Board of Trade
or any other organization of importance in
tbis country, including Pýarliament, will net
seriously oppose the giving of assistance te
sucb a representative industry. Selfishness is
an unworthy characteristie.
T de net hegrudge any legitimate public expenditure in
Montreal. We are ail proud of that great

JUNE 14, 1934
commercial city and should like to see it
flourish, but I protest against the selfishness
that attempts to get the benefit of hundreds
of millions of dollars and then raises an outcry of opposition to the possible expenditure
of a few thousands that may be necessary
for the assistance of our farming industry.
If our agriculture is successful, other industries will succeed.
The honourable leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) claims that this legislation bas some compulsory effects. That is
true to a limited extent. The Minister may
decide as to what proportion of the producers
or growers within a certain area may form
themselves into a board. In other instances
the forming of a board is to be done at the
request of a majority of representative
petitioners. That is all outlined in the Bill.
I am going to cite one or two examples of
compulsory legislation. In the Prairie Provinces when a number of families, among whom
are children of school age, have settled in a
locality, application may be made to the
Government for the establishment of a school
district. The Government must take a vote
to -ascertain whether or not the majority of
the people in that area are in favour of the
establishment of a school district. There
always are people in opposition to suoh a
scheme, but if a majority are in favour of it
the rest have to fall into line. That is compulsion. Another instance is to be found
in connection with the organization of rural
telephone companies in Saskatchewan. An
application may be made to the Provincial
Government for the establishment of one of
these companies in a certain area. Some
people within the area may oppose the application, but if the telephone line is erected
and comes near their land they will be taxed
whether they make use of the telephones or
not. The honourable senator from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) will confirm what I have
said about the school districts and the rural
telephone system, because he very ably administered both of these matters for many
years. I submit that these are instances of
the same kind of compulsion that is provided
for in this Bill. It is simply compulsion at
the request of the majority, which under our
system always rules.
Every industrial concern or every profession
is thoroughly organized, but agriculture, our
most important industry, bas no organization
of any consequence. The object of this legislation is to provide a scheme under which our
agricultural interesti can be placed on a sound
basis, and the producers enabled to receive a
fair remuneration for their products.

525

As I have al.ready pointed out, this is new
legislation of a kind that bas not been tried
out. It may be found deficient in man.y
respects, but the only way we can ascertain
whether it is or not is to give it a triai. I
feel that this House would be warranted in
endorsing the Government's proposed policy
of making a sincere and constructive effort to
assist the producers of natural products in
this country by co-operating with them and
the provincial governments in the manner set
out in the Bill before ,us. I think that a
year or two after the legislation comes into
effect the scheme will be considered one of
the best ever devised for the farmers of
Canada.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, we are here considering "an Act to
improve the methods and practices of marketing of natural products in Canada and in export trade, and to make further provision in
connection therewith." This particular subject
is one to which I, with my Jimited capacity,
have given much consideration for many
years. At one time I acce;pted money from
the Canadian Government for considering
questions such as are involved here. I should
be delighted if after the experience I have
had and with whatever powers of judgment
I ipossess I could follow the thoughts, the
claims and the hopes of my honourable friend
who bas just spoken (Hon. Mr. Gillis). But I
think he is mistaken.
First, last and alil the time I am in favour
of what is alleged to be the intention of this
measure. I am in favour of helping to relieve
the producers-and also the consumers, who
have been overlocked in this Bill-from the
graft and exploitation from which, in my
judgment, they have suffered in years gone by.
I think that the producers and the consumers
of Canada have been subjected to robberies
far greater than any that Jesse James or
Dillinger ever executed. If I thought tihat the
measure would in any way tend to alleviate
the improper conditions that have existed for
these many years, I would heartily favour it
and boost for it. But in my judgment it is
a wooden gun. I say it is absolutely unworkable. It is aimed at the wrong parties if the
intention is to relieve producers and consumers from the exploitation to which they
have been subjected. In my judgment it was
never intended to work. That is a rather
broad statement, but I ask honourable senators to please bear with me and tell me in
the coming months and years whether I am
right or wrong.

3zo

SENATE

I am going to try to prove now, before I sit
down, ýthat I am right in the assumption that

there never was any intention to put into
effect a Bill of this kind. It will be remembered how last session we struggled with the
Railway Bill, and how finally it was passed
in its various phases-not to the satisfaction
of all, but against the opposition, expressed
or otherwise, of some. For several nonths
after the passing of that measure, to which
we devoted such earnest consideration, we
waited to see the law implemented.
The
right honourable leader of the House referred this afternoon to the length of time
taken to appoint the Board of Trustees. As
a matter of fact, I think the appointments
were not made until late in NovemberHon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

The

lst

of

January of this year.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. I ask tonourab'le senators on both sides to please understand that I am not trying unduly or
improperly to raise political questions. I
admire the intestinal fortitude that has been
exercised in some respects in the past few
years. I nay be chided for saying that, but
it is a fact. And I do not doubt that the
honourable gentlemen who tave sponsored the
measure now before us really believe that it
may be the cure-all for the ills that bave
been affecting producers and consumers in
C:nada.
I pause to think of the wonderful changes
that time brings to us al]. In fancy I go
back less than fifteen years to a conference
I attenced. I think it was the first time I met
the distinguisled leader of this House. On
that particular day I learned that a highsalaried official of the Federal Government
had been sent with the necessary Order in
Council to Fort Frances, Ontario, for the
purpose of spiking down switch rails and
preventing carloaids of newsprint paper frotm
being shilppcd out of the Fort Frances mil1
to the United States. In that country the
prevailing market rate was $165 a ton, whereas we had said to the producier in Canada
that $80 was the only price that should be
paid. A few datys later I sat in an office and
saw a gentleman from Waterburv, Connecticut,
pleading almost with tears in his eyes for an
opportunity to buy newsprint paper at the
price of $165 a ton. And te was told: "No;
we are sorry, but the price is $80 a ton, and
all the paper is earmarked and allocated; so
you cannot have any of it."
I go back to another occasion of almost
fifteen years ago, and I find certain views
expressed by my riglt honourable fric nd
Hon. Mir. MURDOCK.

(Riglht Hon. Mr. Meighen). On the 4th day
of July, 1919, te said:
It is questionable if the fixing of prices as
carried on is iot criminal under the code.
But thisHe was speaking in another place on the
Combines and Fair Prices Bih.
-is
designed to divide the sheep from the
goats.-to ascertain where a fixed price is
unfair and w-bere it is not, and to leave alone
the men who are all right, and go after the
others.
I am absolutely in accord with that opinion
of the right lonourable gentleman, and I
presume thut is still his opinion. But will
this Bill now before us pcrmit of anything
of that kind being done? I doubt it. With
deference to my honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), I want to refer briefly to a few
portions of the Bill to try to prove to tonourable members, as I have proved to myself, that the measure is not intended to te
worked, will net be worked, and is absolutely
unworkable.
For the benefit of my honourable friend from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Gillis) I shalt quote later something with
which te suredly will net disagree. although te
found fault with the representations made by
the Montreal Board of Trade and Montreal
papers. I do not know whether it tas occurred
to my honourable friend that those representations of the Montreal Board of Trade may
have been merely a smoke screen. I read that
communication and at once forme.d the
opinion, which J still hold, that the representations wre merely a smoke screen to
divert the attention of the Goverment fromn
te proper source. A little later on I shal
in'dicate what I mean by the proper source,
and who they are who bave exploited the
producers and consumers in ttis Canada of
ours.
Let us briefly analyse certain portions of
this Bill to sec if it is at all workable. I will
deal first with section 3. The caption at the
tead of this section is "Dominion Marketing
Board." Subsec-tion 1 provides:
The Governor in Council may establish a
board to be known as the Dominion Marketing
Board to regulate the marketing of natural
produits as hereinafter provided.
I presume it is fair to infer that the word
"marketing" as userd there is intended to mean
the marketing or sale, and that the purpose
is to regulate the marketing or sale of natural
products. The section goes on to provide how
the board shall be formed, who may be members, and other necessary items.
Then we come to the powers of the board,
in section 4. I quote section 4:
(1) The Board shall, subject to the provisions
of this Act, have power

JUNE 14, 1934
(a) to regulate the time and' place at which,
and to designate the agency through which the
regulated product shall be marketed, to determine the manner of distribution, the quantity
and quality, grade or class of the regulated
product that shall be marketed by any person
at any time, and to prohibit the marketing of
any of the regulated product of any grade,
quality or class.
Omitting the intervening paragraphe, I come
to:
(f) to require any or all persons engaged in
the production or marketing of the regulated
product to register their names, addresses and
occupations with the Board, or to obtain a
licence from the Board, and such licence shall
be subject to cancellation by the Board for
violation of any provision of this Act or regulation made thereunder.
If I understand the English language this
means that Bill Jones, a switchman at Truro,
N. S., who bas a couple of dozen hills of
potatoe&-ipotatoes are one of the regulated
products in Nova Scotia-must register his
name, address and occupation with the board
to obtain a licence. Oh, I am quite sure
someone will say, "That is not what is intended." I reply, that is the wording of the
Bill: "to require any or all persons engaged
in the production or marketing"-not production for marketing--"of the regulated product."
A very important part of the Bill deals
with marketing schemes. Last night, answering the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), the right
honourable leader said:
Certainly the Governor in Council can insist
that in any area the same board deal with
several natural products. Several boards may
be united in the interest of economy. Amalgamations of course would also reduce the number.
I submit that no such authority is given.
Under the section I am about to quote only
those directly interested in the production or
marketing of the one stated product can set
up a. local board under the supervision of the
Dominion board.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable gentleman look at section 8, subsection c?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That does not affect
my argument at all. I concede at once that
this language appears to imply that one local
board could be set up for potatoes, others for
sugar beets, mraple syrup, carrots, fish, and so
on. But that is not what my right honourable
friend said last night. These are his words:
"Certainly the Governor in Council can insist
that in any area the same board deal with
several natural products." The Bill does not
say so. I am referring to the sections under

527

the heading of Marketing Schemes. I cite
section 5:
(1) A representative number of persons
engaged in the production and marketing or
the production or marketing of a natural
product may petition the Governor in Council
to approve a scheme for the regulation of the
marketing of such natural product by a local
board under the supervision of the Board.
(2) The petition shall be filed with the
Minister and if lie considers that the persons
engaged in the production or marketing of
the -natural product are sufficiently represented by the petitioners, the scheme shall be
referred to the Board with a request for a
report on the expediency thereof.
I submit this merely implies that potato
producers will deal with potatoes, maple syrup
producers with maple syrup, and so on.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Suppose there
is a board for maple syrup producers and a
board for potato producers, and the Governor
in Council under section 8 provides for their
amalgamation. Is not that doing precisely
what I told the right honourable senator from
Eganville could be done? How could you
amalgamate unless there were two or three or
four boards, each dealing with separate natural
products?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But under subseetions 1 and 2 of section 5, which I have just
read, no man would be eligible to serve on a
board of that kind unless lie was a producer
of the commodity that was being handled
under the scheme.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But what
takes effect on the amalgamation?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, if the potato
man is going to scratch the back of the sugar
man, or vice versa, it will make the proposal all the more unworkable and objectionable.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If it concerned
potatoes and carrots it would not be so bad.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No. That would be
a closer relation. They would be just redheaded potatoes.
Now I come to section 6:
(1) When a scheme has been approved by
the Governor in Council, the Minister shall
give public notice thereof in the Canada
Gazette.
(2) The provisions of the scheme as approved
shall have the force of law, and the local board
shall, from the date of the publication of the
said notice of approval, be a body corporate.
The other day I read a Canadian Press
despatch stating that a professor in Russia
was unable to bury his dear old mother
for two or three days because he could not
deliver to the authorities her ration card.

truth, I was rather busy at that time trying
to take care of my own business. I am not
giving away any secret when I say that I
had it on my mind. We were then trying,
with the machinery available, to do what ve
could to get after the grafters. Out in British
Columbia we were able to go aftrr some of
the grafters. They -are on the job to-day, as
they have bren for many years, exploiting the
producer and the consumer. At that time
we secured convictions against eight of them
and they were fined S25,000 apiece, or a total
of $200,000. But that did net mean anything
to them. The consumer paid the money a
little Iater on. He had paid it before, and
he is paying it at this minute. As I see it,
this measure will not tend to stop such abuses.
If there is a real desire to do anything ta
help the producer and the consumer, it can
be done; but it cannot be donc by jumping
on the fellow lower down. You all know the
reason vhy the fellow higher up has not been
jumped on and is not being controlled. He is
too affluent. In many cases he has a title,
he is a big fellow, he is a power in the community, and he must not be meddled with.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Any particular product.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; there is
a great difference between the two.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is a great
diffarence, but the whole principle is tied up
in the authority that is given from time to
time to restrict this, that or the other thing.
On behalf of whom? Not usually of the producers, nor of the consumers, as I have observed; maybe in certain cases, but not
usually.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is the Montreal Board of Trade producing potatoes?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What natural
product is it producing?
Hon. Mr. ýMURDOCK: Maybe the Montreal Board of Trade is very much interested
in the production of natural products; in
other words, it is holding the sinews of war,

I do.

the importation of pulp andl papeS ' I suppose? The honourable gentleman ia away
fromn the facts.
Hon. Mr. MURDO4)K: I know my right
benourable friend does flot like to hear this.
I think the principle of the Bill is absolutely
wrong. That is why the Montreal Board of
Trade put eut its smoke screen to bide the
necessity of ýconceding to the Governer in
Council the right to prohibit or restrict as
far as possible this, that or the other tbing.
Now I corne to what app-ears to me the
most peculiar part of the Bill. Iu years gone
by it was generally regarded as esýsential te
ascertain the facts beore rendering a decision
on any subject in dispute. But in the Bilwhicb my honourable friend across the aise

I deals wit-h everything that is beid to be
neoessary te protect the interests of the producer. and no investigation is req'uired. In
Part II I find the only reiference in the Bill
to the rights of the consumer. Section 18, in
part, rea-ds:
(1) Whenever as a resuit of any sucb
investigation the Minister shall have reason to
believe that such a situation exists as requires
further inquiry he may at the request of the
Board or on his own initiative appoint a
committee to inquire into the spread in connection with the marketing, adaptation for

provision had been placed in Part I of the
Bill it would have appeared to me that there
was some intention of dealing fairly with the
public; but Part I, covering practically everything that is to bie doue for the producer or
the distributor, makes no provision for investigation.
Now then. does the consumer need any
protection under a Bill of this kind?
In my
judgment hie does. Iu my opinion the consumer has at times been exphoited almost as
nuch as9 the producer, though, speaking
geueralv I thiuk the producer has been exploited more than the consumer. The consumer bas been exploited to a great extent.

May I, te prove this,, read from the ýreport
of a certain important iuquiry that for many
weeks bas been going on in another place?
1 do not think I shahl be goi.ng outside the
rules of this Huse in reading from the printed
record of what took place, in order to prove
my point that the consumer bas been and is
being seriously exploited, and that it is not
the producer nor the consumer that sbould be
reguilated, but ail teo often the fellows in high
placesHon. Mr. TANNER: No!
Hou. Mr. MURDOCK: -seme of whom
have been exalted to such au extent that they
have been given titles. The result is that
by millions of Canadians titles are a byword
and are treated with contempt. I want to read
some of the reasons which show the necesaity
of protecting, in a measure of this kind, the
consuming puibiic.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
honourable gentleman reading from?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I amn reading from
issue No. 47 of the report of the investigation
conducted by the Special Committee on Price
Spreads andl Mass Buying, of Wednesday, June
6, 1934.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman knows just as well as I do
that hie is not permitted te refer te the proceedings; of a committee of either House while
that committee is still sitting, and before it
luas reported. He knows aise bow grossy
unfair it would be to do se.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I know t1hat my
righit bonourwble friend does not intend to
say that I know semething that I do not
know. I did net know.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman cannot, refer te it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOGK:. I did net know
that. I take my right honourable friend's
word fer it, and say this: that what we want
in this Canada of ours is a bill tbat will reach,
flot the producer or the consumer, but the
grafteris. I use the word advisedly, because
any man who cleans up bis business with a
35,000,000 rake-off andl then soaks the publie
on the sale ef stock for that amount le, in
my judgment, nothing but a grafter. In my
judgment the individual who indulges in practices of that kind is ne less a grafter because

incidentally my right honourable friend will

from the public; and I am saying he is the

They got their pension, though, regardless of

"to set a trap for fools."1

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I mean it. But I

your attention.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Gi!lis) a
little while ago objected to references to the
Montreal papers and tho circular of the
Montreal Board of Trade.
Surely ho will
not repudiate an official document from the
Liberal-Conservative Association of Ontario,
which appears in Monday's issue of the
Ottawa Journal. This is captioned in large
black letters: "Do you wish to be a Kulak?"
Please correct me if my pronunciation is
wrong. "A message to the farmers of Ontario."
Listen to the two first paragrapls. This is a
repudiation pure and simple of the Dominion
Government, which proposes to bring down
this Marketing Bill, and serves notice on all and
sundry that the farmers of Ontario want none
of it. Let me read the language that appears:
You have read of Russia. You know what
farming in the land of the Soviet bas become.
State collectivization, with industrialization
the supreme goal, bas made the fariner little
better than the beasts of the field, the hewer
of wood and the drawer of water to the more
0
t
favoued classes, those to whomi ('ominisl
looks for the ultimate success of its state
industrialization experiment.
The second paragraph bears a large black
caption: "Farmers must he free." It goes on
to say:
Ontario wants no "swing to the left." Its
farners must be left free. The men who, in
1932, produced $226,446,000 of this province's
wealth. cannot be made the stepping stone for
somae radical experiment in state industrialization.
Farmer though he is, Ontario's Liberal leader
is prepared to sacrifice his own friends, to
betray his fellow workers in the fields in a
frantie bid for control of Ontario's vast natural
wealth.
The point is, "farmers must bc free." If I
understand the English language, they want
no part in this Bill which proposes to put
them under quotas and regulations whereby
they will have to obtain an identification card
and a permit to grow potatoes. or tap a maple
tree for sa.p, or do certain other things, while
the real culprits are sitting in offices in Montreal. Toronto, and elsewhere, laughing at the
lame and inane efforts that are being made
to give the under dog a square deal. They
know the pickings may not be quite as good
as they have been, but they know at least
they will be good enough for years to come,
no matter what is done in the matter of controlling the purchaser, the distributor and the
consumer.
So I say, honourable gentlemen, that in my
judgment this Bill is simply an imposition
upon the intelligence of the Canadian people;
and I have the audacity to say that in spite
of the fact that my right honourable friend
told me to go home and stay home.

JýUNE 14, 1934
1 think I know something about the necessities of the producer and the consumer, and
how they have been exploited. Although in
some respects I would flot set up my honestto-goodness judgment against that of the right
hanourable leader of the House, 1 would express the 'view that I arn just as sincere as
hie in a desire to do somethinge for the under
dogs, for many years exploited in this Canada
of ours.
I sympathize fully with the hope of my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Gillis) that this
Bill wiII do something to proteet and benefit
the farmers and others in Western Canada.
They should be .protected and benefited, as
should those engaged in the fishing industry of
the Est, and in the lumbering industry and
the pulp industry of Canada. But it cannot
be accomplished in this way. You have to
reach the few, and not make a big, broad pretense, as thîs Bill does, of reaching out and
controlling many. If, in spite of anything
that may appear or may be said, honourable
gentlemen opposite are bound to put this Bill
through-and they are sufficiently numerous
to do that-ali I ask is that in the months and
years to corne they will analyse its resuits and
see how it has worked out. Many think that
what has been done in the past with respect to
dealing with Canada's wheat crop can be done
again, but it is ahl buncombe to suggest that
the potato crop .of British Columbia, the sugar
beet erop of Alberta, and of Kent and Essex
counities, and1 the fishing industry of the Maritimes and of the Pacifie, can be controlled in
the same way. It is ahl wrong and improper.
The approach is fromn an entirely wrong angle.
The fellow who ought to be controlled is thc
one who is dealing with the producer and seiling to the consumer.
I have just one last word. I hope that if
honourable gentlemen, who are sufficient in
numbers to put this Bill tbrough, insist upon
doing so, they will at least inake -one friendly
gesture to the consumer by agreeing to name
hinm as one of tihe possible meni2iers of ane of
the innumerable boards contemplated for the
purpose of dealing with things of vital concern anjd interest to hlmi.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members of the Senate, at this late hour perhaps
the first thing I ehould do is to assure hionourable, membera Vhat I have no preipared
speech, anid rise merely for the puipose of
giving expression to saine thoughts t.hat have
entered niy minai durinig t>he discussion.
The honourable mexuber for Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murciock) dwelt at great length on subsections 1 and 2 of section 5 of the Bill, under
whjch hie maintained it would. be necessary to
74728-344

531

establish a great many boards. I have read
these subsections rather carefully, and while
they do limit the establishment of the board
to people engageai in the production of natural
produets wbich are to, be regulateai, I do not
find anything whiich in any way define8 the
occupation of any man who shah ibe appointed
to the board.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No?
Hon. Mr. DONNFLLY: There is nothing
in any part of the Bill which limita that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does it not say,
"engaged in the production andi marketing"?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: That refers ta
those who may make application; not those
who will constitute the iboard. So in that
respeot 1 think the honourable gentleman is
in error.
The honourable gentleman bas very properly shown some solicitude for the consumer. I sympathize with him in that, but in
my judgsnent, and I think in the judgment of
most people lin this country, the condition of
the consumer-and I suppose we are largely
interestcid in the labour element as consumera
-will only be perma.nently improved when
those engaged in the production of natural
products are piaceai in such a fin ancial position that their purchasing power is brought
back to a point in keeping with the purehasing power of some five or six years ago. I do
not think the labourîng classes will ever assume their proper place until such a condition
is brought about.
The honourable leader on the other aide
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is apparently much
concerned about the restrictive parts of the
Bui, and hie argued for the freedom of the
individual to d ispose of bis own producta
as hie sees fit. We should aIl be vcry pleased
if we were not obligeai ta conformi ta certain
reguhations. However, as we go through life we
finai that we are restricteai in numerous ways
for the good of our fellow men. Under the
Governinent of which niy honourable friend
was a promninent member we had restrictive
legislation in regard ta the marketing of
products of the farm. Many farmers in this
country are engaged in the raising of seed,
such as red claver seed, alfalf a seed, alsike
claver secai, andi other varieties. A mani may
thresh one hundred. bushels on bis farni, and
the crop may appear to be very dlean, but
before he caru senai any of the seed over to
bis neighbour hie must have it certified by an
official of the Dominion Government. In sa
far as this Bill seeks to regulate the sale of
agricultural produets it is net new; it is only
an extension of a practice that has been in
aperation for many years.

532

SENATE

I gather that the honourable leader on the
other side and the honourable gentleman from
Parkdaie (Hon. Mr. Murdock) are of the
impression that this Bill regulates all marketing, but as I read the measure its provisions
apply only to interprovincial and export trade.
Trade within any province is wholly under
the control of provincial authorities, and I
think this Bill makes no attempt to interfere
with it.
What objection can there be to the enactment of legislation which would prevent a
cattIle dealer from shipping to the Old Country
a load of scrub cattle, half finished, and spoiling our reputation for live stock on the British
market? Such prevention is one of the purposes of this Bill. We recently had before
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry a witness who displayed an intimate
knowledge of live stock marketing conditions
in Great Britain. Honourable members on
both sides of the House who were present
at that meeting will remember he impressed
upon us the necessity for prohibiting the shipment of poor cattle to England. He also
stressed the point that we should take certain
steps in order to retain our share of the
market. He stated that other countries, our
chief competitors, always have in Britain representatives who keep their governments informed of market conditions. We were told
that those representatives do net advertise
their presence in England. In fact, the witness said that they are so solicitous to keep
their activities from being noticed that at
times they walk backwards so that they may
net be tracked.
There is another feature of this Bill to
which I think attention should be drawn. The
honourable senator from Parkdale has great
faith in labour and trade unions of all kinds.
I have no objection to them. But it has been
contended for a generation or more that the
agricultural population of this country should
be organized somewhat along the lines adopted
by workers in other industries.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: As I understand
it, one of the objects of this Bill is to assist
in such organization, to help place the farmers
in a position similar to that occupied by other
classes, where they can look alfter their own
interests.
The Bill is the brain child of the Department of Agriculture, and more particularly of
the Minister of that department. I know that
there are clauses which if not properly administered eould cause hardship, but it is not
reasonable to suppose the Minister or the deHon. Mr. DONNELLY.

partment will use the provisions of the law to
impose unnecessary burdens upon consumers
These officials have their

ears to the ground and are influenced by publie opinion. They would 'have ne ulterior
motive in causing this Bill to work any hardships.
It has already been stated that the measure
is an eçperiment. I think it is an endeavour
along honest, earnest and well-thought-out
lines to give the producers of natural products an opportunity to improve their conditions. I therefore think we should pass the
Bill and enable the Government to demonstrate what can be donc.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Is it a fact
that the farmers in Ontario wanted to be
left free?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I have no reason
to believe so.
Hon. D. E. RILEY: Honourable members,
it is not my intention to take up much of the
time of the House in my remarks on this
Bill. These remarks will be confined to the
effect it will have on the live stock industry,
more particularly the commercial cattle end
of it.
Last session I pointed out to this Chamber
the importance to Canada of the cattle industry, the sad plight it was in, owing to low
prices, and the absolute necessity of some
change in our system of marketing. As a
result of the discussion on the motion to
whieh I spoke at that time, our Standing
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, of
which the honourable senator from South
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly), is Chairman, was
authorized to inquire into the conditions of
the export trade in cattle, and the cattle industry generally. We held severall sittings,
but owing to the short time between the
beginning of the investigation and prorogation,
it was decided to carry the work over to the
present session. As the Special Committee
of the House of Commons on Price Spreads
and Mass Buying was taking up the same line
of inquiry, and because of evidently wider
powers might go more thoroughly into the
matter than our committee could, we decided
to postpone our proceedings for the time being
at least, so as to avoid duplication and
unnecessary expense.
The present Bill comes, in my opinion, in
response to a concerted demand made upon
the Government by the live stock interests of
Canada in the last few months for the appointment of a National Live Stock Marketing
Board in the four Western Provinces at least,

JUNE 14, 1934
and, I understand, in two others. Conditions
hed become so intolerable, owing to low prices,
that the people in their extremity decided to
appeal to the Federal Government for some
means of relief. Adi parties interested in the
industry were called together to consider what
might be done, not merely to assist, but to
sa.ve it, and resolutions were passed and
forwarded to this Government asking for the
appointment cf a board. In the province of
Alberta the Government called a conference
in the city of Edmonton on January 12 of
this year to discuss problems associated with
the marketing of live stock and live stock
products. This conference was representative
of all interested in the marketing of live stock
products-consumers, packers, stockyard officials, live stock commission men, and others.
The following resolution was passed and
forwarded to the Government:
Whereas the live stock industry of Canada,
particularly that of the Western Provinces-There has been some discussion this evening
as to whether this Bill is in response to demands from the West. I think the agitation
began in the West.
-is at present in a most deplorable state due
to the decline of prices to a level at which
the producers of live stock are receiving
returns very much below the actual cost of
production;
And whereas it is imperative that definite
and immediate action be taken to place the
industry on a sound and economie basis;
And whereas the economic prosperity of the
entire country depends upon profitable prices
to primary producers;
Therefore be it resolved that this conference. representative of all interests concerned
in the various branches of the live stock
industry in the province of Alberta, is
unanimously in favour of requesting the
Federal Government to establish a National
Marketing Board, or Boards, vested with wide
powers, chief amongst its functions to be the
stabilizing of prices of live stock and live stock
products on a basis that will provide an
adequate return to the producer.
Similar conferences were called in the other
three Western Provinces and similar resolutions were passed, all calling on the Government for the establishment of a national
marketing board for the purpose of raising
prices to the producer. The Bill before this
Chamber to-day is the reply of the Government to this nation-wide demand.
In my own mind the principal function of
such a board would be to take the pricesetting power out of the hands of those in
whom it rests at the present time. That
power should be exercised by an independent
board which would have some regard for the
three principal parties interested, namely, producers, consumers and the trade. Such a

533

board would make it possible for the old law
of supply and demand to function again. It
is not functioning now, and later on I shall
point out the reason for this.
As ail honourable members know, the only
outlet for our surplus cattle since 1930 has
been the British market. In 1883, the first
year we exported cattle from the Western
ranges, the United States tariff on cattle was
20 per cent. In 1890 this was changed to $10
per head for cattle over one year old, and
$2 each for cattle under one year. In 1897
the duty on all cattle under one year was
$2 each; on others valued under $14, it was
$3.75 each, and where the value exceeded $14
the rate was 27J per cent. In 1913 all duty
was thrown off and our cattle went in free.
This condition lasted until 1921, or for eight
years, and those were prosperous years for
our cattle men. In 1919 we exported to the
United States over half a million cattle. In
1921 a tariff of 30 per cent was put into force,
and the following year this was raised to two
cents a pound on cattle valued over $10.50
and to one and one-half cents a pound where
the valuation was less than $10.50.
From 1913 to 1921 all our surplus cattle
went to the United States, and even after
the Fordney-McCumber tariff came into effect
we continued to go over that wall and sold
in American markets. The Hawley-Smoot
tariff, however, shut us out entirely. Then
we looked to the Old Country market, which
at the present time is our only outlet. Of
course we are thankful for that outlet. Since
1930 our exports to Great Britain have inoreased, and last year we shipped about
60,000 head.
I should like, however, to point out that
the British market was never a profitable one,
especially for the Western cattle producer.
It never can be profitable for us to ship to
Great Britain. That is an emergency market,
and we have gone there only when we could
not trade with our neighbours to the south.
Since it takes about half the price received
for a steer in England to pay transportation
and other expenses, it seems improbable that
beef will ever be high enough in that market
to return to the Western producer his cost
of production. Rowever, that is our only
outlet and we must, for the present at least,
make the best of it.
There is a feature in our marketing situation that I could never understand. We export about 2 per cent of our pork, mutton and
lamb. Canada consumes over 1,500,000 head
of cattle each year. In the last three years
we have exported annually from 17,000 to
52,000 head, or only about 2 per cent, yet the
price received for that 2 per cent, less the

SENATE

534

cost of transportation, sets the priýce for the
other 98 peýr cent. The theory that the export
price determaines the price on the domestic
market has been quoted and preached to, us in
season and out of seasan until it bas become
an axîamn or an established principle. In my
opinion it is a fallacy that bas been accepted
by an undiscerning people.
\Ve are told the law of supply and demand
controls prices. But that more 2 per cent
which is exportcd absolutely nullifies that
law. The injustice of such a situation is more
striking when wc consider that the Old Country market is a low priced market and is
always bound to remain so.
As soon as wve produce more than anc per
cent in oxccss of our domestie requirements
the law of supply and demand ceases ta funetion, and prices in Canada are governed by
low expert prices, less the cost of transportation. The trade bas some means of offsetting
this situation. It would have paid us ta dump
the 2 per cent surplus in the ocean and allow
the law of supl)ly and demand to function.

At the iprosent time there are two grades
of beef, and I know that the syistem is working eut ta the satisfaction af every one except the praducer. The abject of this grading
system wvas ta encourage the production of a
higher grade ai beef animal, and naturally ta
raise tbe price. Sa fer as I ican sec, the only
one henefiting fram tbis systoma te-day is the
trade, or tbe middlemnan. Tbere sbould be et
least two or three -more grades, and a minimum price set in those grades under tbe marketing system. In no other way do I sec that
the producer ýcan get any protection. And if
the pri-ce ta the producer is not raised ta a

Notwitbistanding the many difficuities I see
in the operation of this mensure, I would flot
vote against it. At its worst it cannot. ha
worse than what we have to-day. I arn hopefui that out of the many comiplicated phases
of the Bill something practical and beneificial
may be worked out.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR:
Honourable senators, my remarks wiil be directed more to
the way in which the Bill may apply to that
part of Canada from which I corne, than to
its general application, though to some extent
I shall deai with this phase also.
I was rather amuse-d by the speech of the
honourabie member from Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. GdIliis). Ha objected to the honourabie
leader on this side (Hun. Mr. Dandurand)
chara.cterizing the prcoposed measure as a
Western Bill, but sbortiy afterwards he
suggested very mildly that it wouid. ha well to
exclude the main natural producýt of the
Prairie Provinces, grain, from the operation of
the Biil.
I shall fot go so far with respect to the
natural produets of Eastern Canada. I think
it is generalýly conceded by those who have
followed the debates on tbe Biil froin the time
of its introduction in tbe Commons tbat seinething is needed to help the farmer, the pro*lucer and the labourer in this trying period
through which Canada is pnssing. Wbether
the Bili will do ail that is hoped for by those
wbo are most in favour of it is a matter of
conjecture, but I tbink it is only fair tbat we
sbouid analyse tbe measure and do our hast
to imiprove it.
One gene-ral feature I do not like. Tbe Bili
confers very wide powers on a board to be
appointed by the Government. It is admitted
by its warmest supporters that Pariiament bas
neyer yat granted the Government such
extensive powers. I think we have aiready
gone too far in this direction. Particularly in
racent yaars, there has been a tendency to
conifer wide discretion on ministers of the
Crown and oficars of the departments. Now
it is proposed to confer powers which aven the
rigbt honourable leader of this House bas said
hae doas not think any board wouid attempt to

the officiais of tbe department have sent out
copies of proposed regulations for the approval
of those interestad in the Act. I arn surprised,
as I know ara others, to find that it is proposed by tbase regulations to licensa aIl dealers
and traders, as well as avery person wbo maintains one or more branches. A separate licenca
must ha obtainad for each brancb. The reguiation raads:
A licence issuad under these provisions shall

Our market for taible stock potatoes, however, is very limited, andl as time goes on it
becomes more and more Iimited. Five or six
years ago we were able to seil a good many
of these potatoes in the Cuban market, but
that market has been practically lost to us.
We can .sell some high-elass ta>ble stock patatoes in New En.gland when the price is
high, 'but when the crop south of the line is
large and the price is law we do flot find much
market there. The only other market lef t to
us is Central Canada, and when there is a
good crop of potatoes in Ontario and Quebec
we get hardly enough to pay for the growing
of the crop and the freight. So I do flot sec
that any benefit would accrue to the table
stock potato business; in fact, I can see where
difficulty might arise.
Those who have read the débates on this
Bill wil1 rememiber that an illustration was
given of what might be done should the apple
growers of Canada, for instance, find whien
the season apened that a large shipinent from
British Columbia was going Vo Great Britain
th-rough the Panama Canal at the same time
that the growers of Nova Scotia were preparing Vo ship. It would then be within the power
of the board Vo order the Nova Scotia shippers to hold off, in order that too many appies might flot be thrown on the market at
one ime. Then, if the Nova Scotia shippers
found that they had Vo Vake a baes, it would
be the duty of the board Vo make up that loss
by a toil on the ex~port of the product generally.
If that principle is applied to interprovincial trade, it looks as though we might find
ourselves in this position. It would be open
to the producers in Ontario and Quebec, who
wished to geV as good a price as they could,
to petition the board to prevent the potatoes
of the Maritime Provinces from coming to
the Central Canada market in the early part
of the season, when they tbemselves have
plenty of potatoes which they can ship, and
intend Vo ship. If the board were to attempt
to enforce the power given Vo it in this
regard, and Vo control interprovincial trade
by requiring the producers of the Maritime
Provinces Vo hold back their product until
the Central Canada crop was marketed, the
board would be in the position of having to
make good any losses Eastern Canada might
sustain by reason of the board's order. It
seems o,-me that to give sucli a power to the
board is rather dangerous, and that it will
make for disruption, or will set one part of
Canada against another in a way that is noV
desirable or conducîve Vo the good of the
country generally.

Then there is another feature. It seems
to me that the board is given very wid2
powers in regard Vo prohibiting, restricting
or controlling exports or imports of natural
products. I think that is something that
should at least come hefore Parliament for
ratification hefore it is put into effect. Public
opinion is a great tester of any such action
as that; and to give this board power to
impose quotas, under a trade agreement, if
it wishes-lor that is what section 12 amounts
to-is, I think, going entirely too far; and I
would strongly recommend to the right honoura-ble the leader of the Huse that he should
consider a limitation of that clause so that it
may noV have such a wide application. From
this you will sce, honourable gentlemen, that
while I admit that some features of this Bill
might he helpful, there are others which I
think are working in the wrong direction.
I was pleased Vo hear the right honourable
thle leader of the bouse say yesterday, in
speaking to the motion of the honourable
senator from Red Deer (bon. Mr. Michener),
that the primary cause of the period Vhrough
which we are passing was debts-debts international, national, provincial, municipal and
personal. I agree with him in that. I think
he struck the nail on the head. In view of
that condition, are we doing in this Bill what
we should do to relieve the producer and the
labourer from the burden which they are
carrying? I know the farmers, the labourers
and others are finding it very difficult Vo get
along and are asking most seriously if everything that can be done Vo meet the situation,
or at least to equalîze the load of debt that
is upon us, is being done. It is not necessary Vo go into the details in these matters,
because every honourable member knows them
as well as I do. As against that debt we have
the earning power of the people; but that
earnýing power is at a very low point-almost
as low as it was at any time during the depression-and it is that low earning power that
makes it hard for the farmers, producers and
artisans Vo meet their liabilities.
I know the people are thinking of this.
They may not be saying very much, but I
feel strongly enough abou.t it Vo mention it
at this time, in connection with a Bill of such
wide application as the one before us. It is

Rankin. It is a little more than two weeks
since he was stricken within the walls of this
Chamber, and from that time up to the hour
of his death all his friends have been concerned as to whether he could recover.
It is a matter of surprise to most of us to
learn tha-t he had reached the age of 79 years.

His comparatively young and vigorous appearance testified to the life be led.

No one

who, like myself, was raised in the district
from which Dr. Rankin came could fail to
be aware of the high regard in which be was
held professionally, as well as personally,
throughout a large area in Western Ontario.
From early life Dr. Rankin devoted his energies chiefly to the medical profession, and
even up to the time of his being stricken it

main preoccupation. Throughout the county
of Perth the narne of Dr. Rankin was a household word. When released from his duties
here he was constantly passing to and fro
in the service of his fellows, and I know that,
very largely without reward, he brought confort and mercy to a multitude of people.
In 1908, after passing middle life, be entered
the iouse of Commons, remaining there three
years. He returned to the Commons in 1921.
For the past nine years be has served among

us. His quiet, unobstructive demeanour was
such that be did net become at all prominent

in the controversies of this House, but that
sarne demeanour, associated with a natural
intelligence, impartiality and fairness of view

on all subjects, endeared him to us all.
I am sure I express the feeling of every

honourable senator in saying that we lament
sincerely and deeply Dr. Rankin's loss, and
in asking that this expression of our sympathy
be transmitted to his surviving daughters.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

Honourable

senators, we witness to-day the departure of
one who represented ideal health and vigour.
Dr. Rankin towered over us, and his splendid
physique gave promise of his remaining with
us a long time.

Yet suddenly he has passed

away. We are reminded that the Psalmist
\vas not far astray when he placed the span

of human life at three score years and ten.
More and more do I realize that men who
have passed the age of seventy are living days
of grace.
We enjoyed the presence of Dr. 'Rankin
because of his qualities of mind, his amiability
and good fellowship. He had poise, judgment,
a kind heart, and we could well understand
why those among whom be lived and practised

his profession sent him to Parliament.
I am glad that my right honourable friend
has been able to testify as to the late sena-

tor's standing in the community from which
the right honourable gentleman himself
comes.
May I supplement this eulogy by a statement handed to me by Dr. Rankin's bereaved
personal friend, Senator Lewis, who before be
left for Stratford this afternoon asked me to
present it to this Chamber. It is as follows:
"It would be unbecoming for me to dwell
on the grief which bas overtaken me in the
loss of my roommate and intimate friend for
nearly nine years; nor am I qualified to speak
adequately of Dr. Rankin's chief claim to the
esteem and affection of his fellow citizens,
which lies outside thefield of public affairs.
"It is true that his public career bas been
long and honourable. He was public spirited,
a lover of his country, staunchly Canadian and
staunchly British, Liberal in the broad sense,
with a firm hold on Liberal principles, frank
in his expression of them, a good fighter and
a fair one. But to obtain a truc idea of his
life-work, one would require to hear the
testimony of the people of Stratford and its
vicinity, to whom be ministered for so many
years as a skilled physician and a faithful and
considerate friend. He was a type of the
family physician of the old school. His work
was not of a character to win publicity or
fame or great pecuniary gains. He found his
reward in the service itself, and in the confort which be brought to thousands of homes.
To those who have personal knowledge of his
life-work, his death is in the truest and deepest
sense a bereavement."

Under section 5, Marketing Schemes, after a

Hon.

Mr

DANDURAND

JIJNE 15, 1934
Following the experiment, also a new one,
which is being tried out in Great Britain,
the Government of our country is ready to
take action along similar lines. A systemn that
w.orks well in one country may prove un.satisfactory in anuther. Our general economic
system i.s one that lias stood the test of
experience for many years, though it has been
somewhat disturbed by the recent depression.
The scheme proposed here cannot be organîzed and put into operation in a day. Some
time will be neceesary for its deveiopment,
to bring people to the point of asking the
Governor in Council for a board, to have the
necessary poli taken, and so on. So there
is no absolute neces.sity of proceeding hastily
with the application of this measure. Once
we decide to start upon the venture we should
accept the principle adopted in Great Britain
that parliamentary approvai and ratification
are necessary before the scheme can be applied
in any instance. Both branches of Parliament, after being presented with the facts of
a concrete case, might in the exercise of their
sovereign power decide that the proposai was
a good one, thougli there were objectors to it.
The matter wouid have been subjected to the
iimelight of pubiicity and the wili of the
people wouid have been expressed by their
representatives. Extraordinary powers are t
be granted to the Government in the application, of this proposed scheme, but I believe
our people wouid take no objection to its
application in any instance wherein a majority
of their parliamentary representatives had
expressed approvai.
I will move only the one amendment, because I believe it goes to the kernel cf the
difference between, the two schools of economie thought, one favouring frecdom of the
people and competition, and the other, controlled economy. We are now moving rapidly
towards a systemn of controlled economny
which seemed to be abhorrent to Conservatives and Liberais alike flot very many months
ago. I desire to test the wiil of the House
on this amendmnent. If it is rejected the
responsibility will rest on those who vote
against it.
On section 2-interpretation:
Paragraphes a, b, c and d were agreed to.
On paragrapli e-natural produets:
Hon. Mr. MOLIJOY: I move that the
words "other than wheat" bc inserted after
the word "grains" in the second line of this
paragraph. and that the words "(with the exception of wheat)" be added after the words
etnaturai products of agriculture" in the fiftli

line. My amendment is seconded by the hionourable senator from. High River (Hon. Mr.
Ri]ey).
Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAND: How would the
paragraph read with that amendment?
The CIIAIRM AN: It would read as follows:
(e) "natural product" includes animale,
meats, eggs, wool, dairy products, grains other
than wheat, seedg, fruit and fruit products,
vegetables and vegetable products, maple
products, honey, tobacco, lumber, and such
other natural products of agriculture (with
the exception of wheat) and of the forest,
sea, lake or river, and any article of food
or drink wlîolly or partiy manufactured or
derived fromn any such product that may be
designated by the Governor in Council, in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the hionourable gentleman explain the reasons for his
amendment?
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: The reasons are
simple. Wheat is the principal product exported by the Canadian people. It is now
regulated, guarded and graded by the Grain
Commissioners of Canada, who act under a
specifie statute of this Parliainent. We believe
that wheat should be excepted fromn the provisions of the Bill. Wheat is a separate coinmodity and does not interfere with other
natural products. To my mind the Bill contains the power of making it compulsory upon
every wheat grower to join a pool.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Oh, no.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A condition
might arise where that would happen.
,Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: I take it that the
scheme will no doubt work out very well,
but as wheat is a primary produet and our
largest export, 1 think that wheat growers
should not be included within this mneasure.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the hionourable gentleman why hie mentions only
wheat, and not barley and oats, which are
very heavy crops througbout the Dominion?
If wheat is excepted, surc4y barley and oats
should be.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: So far as I ?,m concerned, the honourable member may include
barley and oats in the amiendment, but we are
asking only that wheat be excepted, since i,
is the chief exsport produet of Western Canada. Gats and bariey are largely consumed
in this country, but our wheat is sold on the
markets of the world. Manitoba wheat is
the best obtainable anywhere, and I think
there is no necessity for including it in legislation of this kind.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amendment
of the honourable gentlemen from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Molloy) and High River (Hon. Mr.
Riley) is in accord with the view expressed
last evening by the honourable gentleman
from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis), that
wheat should be excluded from the operations
of this measure. I wonder whether representatives of other parts of the country will
agree with what has been said by the three
honourable gentlemen from the West.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, it is not difficult to grasp the viewpoint of the honourable gentleman from
Provencher in this matter. His position, as I
understand it, is that the grain trade-including not only wheat, but barley and oats to
some extent-has been subject to parliamentary regulation for a long period of years,
the Grain Act having stood in approximately
its present form since the early part of this
century. It will be recalled that the late
Senator Douglas was much interested in that
legislation and took a leading part in the
framing of it. Parliament bas continuously
supervised the marketing of grain from that
time to this. Under the authority of the
Grain Act, the Grain Commission bas complete control over the grading of grain and
the methols by which grain passes from the
prodicer to the ultimate market. It does not
actuallv do any marketing, but superintends
the grading, in itself a colossal task, and its
control is exercised whether the shipper is a
humble individu.al, a big company or a pool.
I assume t'he view of the honoirable gentleman from Provencher to be that the Bill in
its present form would give power to the
Government to wipe out at one fell stroke the
fruit of long years of experience under existng legislation, and to adopt some new and
entirely different system of control over the
marketing of wheat.
Speaking for the Government, may I say
that as far as I know there is no thought of
bringing grain under the operations of this
Bill. That statement may be too broad, but
I think it is correct. I should think the
Government would hesitate very long before
scrapping legislation that has been in effect
for decades, and bringing a product of such
tremendous importance as wheat under an
untried system.
As to barley and oats, though they are
grown in immense quantities in the West
and the East, they are consumed for the
most part in Canada, and therefore the
measure would apply to them only to a small
extent. Wheat is Canada's primary export.
Inasmuch as this proposed legislation deals
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY.

with natural products, it was thought well
to include grains of all kinds. It is conceivable that after some experience bas been
gained in the application of the measure to
other products, it might be thought well to
include grains within the scope of its actual
application.
Consequently it is the desire
of the Government that the Bill be not curtailed in this respect. Should the amendment be rejected, I do not know to what
extent, if any, the Bill might impede the
operations of the Grain Commission, casting
as it were a shadow over that body. but I
know that the Government does wish to have
the legislation passed in the form now before us.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Honourable members,
if the Government has no intention of including wheat within the scope of the Bill,
why not provide the exception asked for by
the honourable gentleman from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Molloy)? In the West we have
had considerable experience with the Wheat
Pool. It not only went bankrupt itself, but
lost $25.000,000 of the people's money and
almost broke the three Prairie Provinces. So
far as J am concerned, I should like to sec
wheat exempted from this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
members, some of the remarks made yesterday gave me a new point of view on this
Bill. If balf of the people are not going to
come within the scope of its operations, that
half will be neither benefited nor injured by
it. I certainly agree with what bas just been
said by the honourable senator from Manitou
(Hon. Mr. Sharpe). Those engaged in the
trade, and particularly the producers of farm
products, are in an anxious frame of mind.
They are willing to accept any aid, but they
do not want their progress hindered.
Reference bas been made to the Grain Act.
There was strong opposition to it at first,
but it is now accepted as a very satisfactory
piece of legislation. Even the slightest threat
of interference with that Act would have a
dampening effect on trade in its prescnt condition. In my judgment what we need as
much as anything is to revive the spirits of
the people. inspire them with the 'hope that
things are improving and will continue to improve. Instead of holding out a threat that
wheat may come within the scope of the Bill,
the Government would be well advised to
accept the amendment, as the Western people
seem to be in favour of excluding wheat. If
in the view of Parliament it becomes essential
to include it, there will be no trouble about
placing wheat under the operation of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.

.TUNE 15, 1934
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But I think it
would be unwise ta include ýwheat when
nobody seems ta favour its coming under the
provisions of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. fILEY: I arn firmly of opinion
that it would be a great mistake ta scrap, the
present legisiation gaverning the handling of
wheat for something we know nothing about.
The Grain Act took a lifetime ta perfect, and
the fýarmers of Western Canada consider that
It is one of the hest pieces of legisiation on
the Statute Book. Under the Act the farmer
can haul a load of oats, we will say, ta the
elevator and seli it at the world's market
price; similarly, hie can store a carload of
grain in the elevator and on the day hie completes hauling it there hie can seli it at the
'world's market price. He has the further
advantage of heing able ta ship bis grain and
en route seli it at the world's market price.
No other legislation proteets the farmer as
thoroughly as does the Grain Act, and, 1 repeat, it would be a great mistake ta scrap it
in favour of something that we know very
littie about.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: I should like ta know
how the amendment would bring about the
serapping of the grain legisle.tion. I have not
asked that the Grain Act be scrapped. The
Grain Commission would continue ta act as
they have always acted.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member misunderstoad mie. 1 said, supposing his amendment does not carry, and
wheat is included within the purview of the
Bill, that ta, my mind would mean scrapping
the -Grain Act.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Molloy was
agreed ta: contents, 14; non-contents, 11.
Paragraph e, as amended, was agreed ta.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE - I have a letter which
might well be submitted at this point. Unfortunately the honourable senator from
Letbbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) had ta Ie-ave
the city last night. He asked me ta bring this
matter ta the attention of the House and request an answer from the right honourable
leader. The letter is from the Colonizatian
Manager of the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District, and is addressed ta Hon.
Senator Buchanan under date of Aipril 27,
1934:
Dear Senator Buchanan:
Since writing you last I have received a
copy of the Marketing Bill. which you kindly
sent me.
I agree that it is clear that sugar could be
brought under the provisions of this Act.

543

What is not clear in my mind, however, is
whether
just how the Act will operate, and
sugar could be brought under the Act if the
present sugar refiners object. I have no doubt
that beet growers by petition could be brought
under the provisions of the Act, but would
this also apply te beet sugar?
Another point, as regards paragraph 'e" of
Section 4, you will note that provision is mnade
to assist by grant or loan the construction or
operation of facilities for preserving, storing
or conditioning the regulated. produet. Do you
think the word "conditioning" can be interIt seems to me
preted to cover processing?
that this is a very important point, and one
which should be made definitely clear.
I would direct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the attention of my honourable friend ta the
fact that the word "processing" bas been inserted in paragraph e.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Paragraph e
of section 2 defines natural products in these
words:
"Inatural product"~ includes animaIs, meats,
eggs, wool, dairy products, grainsThe amendment just passed adds the words
"other than wheat."
--seeds, fruit and fruit produets. vegetables
and vegetable produets, maple produets. honey,
tobacco, lumber, and such other natural
produets of agriculture (with the exception of
wheat) and of the forest, sea. lake or river,
and any article of food or drink wholly or
partly manufactured or derived from any such.
produet that mnay be designated by the Govwvith the
ernor in Coiinciý, in accordance
provisions of this Act.
As far as I know, sugar can be whoily developed from a natural product such as defined, the natural produet being beets. Consequently it would be possible ta include beet
sugar in the Bill. But, speaking again with
a measure of reservation, I do not think it is
the intention of the Administration that anything of the character of a manufactured product such as sugar should corne within the
provisions of the Bill. If it did, of course the
Governor in Council would be able to restrict
importation, and so forth. My thought is
that the definition had ta, be extended in
paragraph e in order ta include such articles
as cheese and butter-things that are altogether made from a natural product.
Answering the latter part of the letter, I
do flot think conditioning can be interpreted
ta include processing.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: But processing has
been added since the ,printing of the Bill.
Paragraphs f and g were agreed ta.
,Section 2, as amended, was agreed ta.
On section 3-Dominion Marketing Board:
Subsections 1 ta 4, inclusive, were agreed ta.

SENATE

On subsection 5-technical and other officers
and employees:
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Does this subsection empower the board to engage outside
assistance?
Right lon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: Yes. But
I want the Committee to understand that
the spirit and framework of the Bill are
based on the local board. The central board,
termed throughout the Bill the Board, is a
sniall supervising general board, and it may
delegate certain of its powers to the local
board.
Therefore I should think appointments would be, to an almost overwhelming
extent, under the local board.
It would
be responsible for the bandling of the scheme.
The scheme itself is approved by the central
board for the purpose of bringing about
uniformity and giving the local board the
benefit of its experience.
I do not think
the staff of the central board would be very
large.
The CHAIRMAN: It was stated in another place that the central board would be
made up of officials now in the employ of the
Department of Agriculture.
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR:
This subsection

In respect of one or

Rigiht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In respect
of one product. If the product were barley
or oats. I fancy the local board would represent the Dominion. Let me illustrate by a
simple case. Fruit growing in British Columbia is an industry in itself. I do net know of
any single industry that would be more the
apple of the eye of this proposed legislation, for attempts have been made already
by provincial legislation to give some form
of stabilization to the industry. We will
Hon. Mr. LITTLE.

assume the apple growers of British Columbia deoide to cone under this Bill. A number of them-and it must be such a number
that the Minister will consider them representative of the whole industry-work out
a plan, in which they define the area to be
covered, probably the whole of British
Columbia.
They state also the basis or
principle upon which the members of the
local board shall be selected, and whether or
net the local board is to have control of
apples sent for consumption to the other
provinces, as well as of apples exported.
Ail particulars have to be set out in the
scheme, and anything further is to be included
that coes within the meaning of section 5.
On receipt of the sclieme the Minister
considers, first, whether it is representative
of the industry in British Columbia. If it
is, and sufficient details bave been given to
fulfil the requirements of section 5, he submits these to his central board. This board,
no doubt after a conference with the local
body which desires the scheme, will make
such modifications in it as may be considered desirable.
If, on the Minister's
recommendation, the schieme is adopted by
the Governor in Council, then it becomes
law, and the powers to carry it out are vested
in the central board. The central board in
turn, with the authority of the Governor in
Council, can vest in the local board the
whole or part of its powers as set out in
section 4. The local board then goes ahead.
The idea is to insure orderly marketing on
the most favourable terms, and to maintain
the high reputation of British Columbia
apples. It will decide what is to be donc
with the product, and will see that provision is made for meeting the demand consistently, so that a market once obtained may
net be lost because there are no goods to
supply it. This, in a few words. is the explanation of the real purpose of the measure.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Subsection 3 of section 5. I understood section 5 to be what the

Subsection 5 was agreed te.

the charges could later on be set off against
the moneys payable. I do ot say they are

they should be, and that each board should

production or marketing of the regulated
prodiiet or any class, variety or grade of such

I take it for granted bthat that exemption
covers any person or class of persons within

will not thank anybody to caîl them branches.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
Then the local
board would flot be a charge on the touls?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
I wish the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) had read t-his before hoe spoke yesterday, because it shows
that there is ample power to exelude those
whom it is not necessary to include, even
though wi.thin the area. It is fantastie to
suggest that anme fellow with potatoes in his
back yard comes witbin this Bill. I shoiuld
assume that only those would be included
whose production amounted to quantity
sufficient to indicate that they might be
exporting, or delivering beyond their own
province.
Consequently the little fellow,
unless he exported a smaîl quantity, would
not corne in at ail. Then alan it might
be wise, in anme out-of-the-way place in
British Columbia, for instance, where the
quantity does ot really matter, tn exempt
the locality altogether. Even tbougb there
is considerable produet, it might be that
there was nt sufficient to affect the situation,
and the resoît would be that that quantity,
to a greater exent than before, would be consumcd within the province. The Bill is made
to apply to the larger areas.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would flot
say that. Later on you will find that the
money is pooled; but before it goes to the
pool reserves can be created, and so on. I
shuuld think that if the organization and
completion of a local board cost anme money

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Wlio will

Board, the local board, or the Government?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That botliered
me. Australia, and I think New Zealand, did
sometliing of this kind, and tlie money came
from tlie Government, as far as I know.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is implied in tlie
governing clauses at tlie beginning cf the
section.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Having
regard to the Board's powers to create reserves and the like, I presume tliis would
come out of the Board's money, and tliat
ultimately it would come from tliose wlio
receive the benefit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And it receives
votes from Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There will
certainly be votes by Parliament to tlie
extent of the expenses of tlie Board. I do
not tliink it is inteuded that tliey shall be
assessed against tliose wlio come under tlie
Act.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Tliat would be a
very small proportion of tlie expense incurred
under this Act.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oli, yes, a
very small part. That is intended to come
out of tlie Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Tlie reason I
mention this is tliat it seems to -me tliat the
two principleýs on whicli our trade must depend
are these: first tlie Iow cost of production, and
second the superiority of tlie product. If this
Board is going to ;collect money in order to
create reserves and assist tliose wlio lose liy
reason of depreciated currency, the cost of
production is going to be increased. If the
money is coming out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund-and I would flot advocate
that; I am flot wedded to it at all-it would
not so directly affect tlie cost of production.
But we must rempmher that every avenue
tliat we open to these boards for tlie expenditure of money that must bc taken from the
producers will cause a disadvantage to our
producers in tlie mnarkets of the world liy
incrcasing tlie cost of production.
7472&-ffl

547

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In view of the statement tliat very little comes *out of the Consolidated Fund to defray tlie expenses of tlie
Act, I would point out tliat in paragrapli e
the Board is given power:
To assist by grant or 'oan the construction
or operation of facilities for preserving, processing, storing or conditioning the regulated
product and to assist researchi work relating
to the marketing of sucli produet.
It would see.m to me tliat if the, expense of
researcli work is to lie provided out of toIll
and money oolletted from tlie regulated productRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may
ho; but initially, I should tliink, there would
liave to ho a vote.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think it should lie
made clear tliat tlie researchi work is to ho
carried on witli moneys provided out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund. Alfter all, we
have a Researcli Council, researeh lalioratories,
and facilities for carrying on any line of researchi work, particularly in relation to agriculture, and our existing facilitieis could without difficulty 'ho made available to tlie Board.
I do think that wlien we are giving tlie Boa-rd
power to make collections liy tolis on the product, we should not inelude research work
among tlie things that are payable for out
of those toill.
Rig.lt Hon. Mir. MEIGHEN: I tliink Parliament may safely leave this section as it is
for tlie time being. Later on we aliall seie hy
wliatever system of accounting is adopted just
liow matters are working out. Simp¶y interpreting the language liere, I sliould say that
the rnoneys appropriated by Parliament for
tlie Board could lie used for the purposes
specified in paragrapli cf; also tliat the Board
would have poweir, wlicl tlie lionourabie
gentleman thinks it should not have, to asseas
against the regulated produet costs for assisting in the activities mentioned in paragrapl
e, including research. I do not sec liow any

researchi could lie required other than tliat
already provided by the existing organization.
We all know that tlie organization of the
Researcli Council is sufficiently elahorate and
pretty expensive, and I think tliere is no
thouglit of setting up a competing organization
under this Board. I suppose any speciai researchi work done liy the Couneil is cliarged
against tlie department in wliose interest it
is done.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In connection witli
agriculture, extensive researcli facilities are
provided at the experimental farms and carried
on under direct grants to the department.

548

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: With regard
to rust, for example?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: No. I think the
research on that is carried on jointly by the
Council and the Cereals Division of the
Experimental Farms Branch. A great deal of
research work is proceeding all the time at
the experimental farms. I do not sea why
any research work should have to ba done by
the Marketing Board, and in my opinion it
should net be empowered to take part of the
tolls to pay for any researching.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course the
research provided for here would relate only
to marketing.

Parcgragph e w-as agreed to.
On paragraph f-registration or licence:
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Has the rigbt honourable leader any information as to what is
propose(d in regard to licences? Doecs the Bill
give the Board power to charge a fee for such
a licence?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
it does. I know of no clause giving such
power.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is an important
point. Section 12 provides for -the licensing
of importers and exporters, and I think power
is given te charge a fee for such licences.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be,
but I do not know of any power to exact
a licence fee from a producer. The honourable gentleman is far more familiar than I
am with details of the licensing system now
in effect. He will remember the evidence
given by Mr. McIntosh before the committee
that was dealing with the Fruit and Honey
Bill. I presume the intention of this paragraph is to extend the present agricultural
licensing system into the field of all natural
products, in order to maintain the control
which is necessary if the legislation is to be
at all operative. It would be necessary to
have sema method of enforcing the law which
is brought into effect at the request of persons
engaged in a particular industry, and I do not
Hon. Mr. SINCLAII&

know any other method than the licensing
of those who are made subject to the scheme.
Naturally the licences will be required only of
persons engaged in the production or marketing of a regulated product.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I was chiefly interested in the point as to whether the Bill
authorized the charging of a fee for the
licence.
Right Hon. Mr. MrEIGHEN: I do not see
any such authority.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The right honourable gentleman referred to the Fruit and
Honey Act. He was net present when I spoke
last evening, but he may have heard of what
has taken place in connection with the regulations under that Act. I think those regulations are net in keeping with the understanding that the committee had after the
interview with the Commissioner.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was not
present when the honourable gentleman made
bis remarks last evening, but I have been informed of what he said, and on the information now before me I think he had grounds
for a rather scerious. indictment. I do not
understand the reason for the action that has
been taken, and I shall make it a point to
inquire and give the honourable gentleman a
siatement with respect to it.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The regulations
I refer to are net actually in effect, but ara
proposed in an official statement sent out by
the department to the trade.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That Act gave
definite power for the imposition of a fee.
I understood from the statement made before
the committee by the departmental official
that the intention was to charge a fee net
exceeding $30; but now, after this House decided on the urgent application of the officials
to leave the regulations to the Minister, instead of the Governor in Council, a fee of
$50 has been imposed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
proposed fee.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The
lations set a fee of $50.

That is the

iproposed

regu-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In respect of
fruit and honey?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Fruit and honey and
vegetables.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is entitled to an explanation,
and I shall try to get one at as early a date

JUNE 15, 1934
as possible. In the present instance I do not
see any power given for the imposition of a
licence fee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have passed
paragraph e, but I should like to ask the
right honourable leader whether the grants or
loans that may be given for the construction
or operation of facilities for preserving, processing, storing or conditioning of regulated
products may not in some instances represent very large amounts, and whetheTr the
Board would be entitled to make those grants
or loans without getting a vote from Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no; the
money would have to be voted.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: With regard
to the question of licences, I fully agree that
if control is to be exercised there must be
some means of recognition of the persons or
companies that are to be controlled, and the
best means is a licence. But if there is a
licence fee, it should be graded according to
the business done, or in any event it ought
to be very smal. and taken only for the purpose of providing some recognition to the
licensed party. My honourable friend from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) stated to me in
private conversation that a fee of $50 would
be almost ruinous to some of the smaller
dealers and producers. It was not the intention of the Fruit and Honey Act that any such
fee should be charged, the purpose of the
licence being merely to show that the person
holding it is engaged in a trade that is subject to governmental control.
Paragraph f was agreed to.
Paragraphs g, h and i were agreed to.
On subsection 2-Board may authorize local
board to exercise powers:
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I wanted to ask a
question in regard to the delegation of powers
to the local board. I am not sure whether
that matter is covered by this subsection.
My question is this. Will the Board have
power to delegate to the local board the
right to make whatever assessment is deemed
necessary on a regulated product, or will the
local board have only the power to collect
the toll after the Board has set the assessment? I think it is important to have that
point cleared up.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: These questions necessitate a close study of the Bill.
The honourable member will appreciate that
I am not in the same position as if I had
been engaged in the preparation of the

measure. From a careful reading of the sections I should say that the making of the
assessment can be done only by the Board.
I shall correct myself later if I find that I
am wrong in this matter. My understanding
is that the local board cannot of itself make
an assessment.
Can the
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
central board give the local board power to
do so?
Right Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN: I do not
think so. The central board has to approve
of the assessment before it can be charged
against the industry. If that is not the case,
it seems to me it should be.
The CHAIRMAN: Subsection 4 provides:
The Board, whether exercising the powers
conferred by this Act or by provincial legislation, may establish a separate fund in connection with any scheme of regulation and for
the purposes of such scheme may impose
charges and tolls in respect of the marketing
of the whole or any part of the regulated
product, which charges and tolls shall be payable by such persons engaged in the production
or marketing of the regulated produet as the
Board decides.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So far as I
know, the local board itself has no such
power.
The CHAIRMAN: Subsection 5 provides
that the Board may authorize the local board
to collect the tolls.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

The CHAIRMAN: It seems to me that
subsections 4 and 5 answer the question asked
by the honourable sena.tor from Queen's
(Hon. Mr. Sinclair).
Subsection 2 was agreed to.
Subsections 3 to 6, inclusive, were agreed to.
On subsection 7-application of proceeds:
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Has the right honourable gentleman any information as to
what is meant by the creating of reserves or
tolls? The application in that respect may
be very wide. What is the object of creating
a reserve, and what limit is set to the reserve
that may be created by tolls imposed on a
regulated produet?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I do not
know that I can give a correct answer. My
idea is that these clauses contemplate dealing
with grain, but I may be wrong in this
assumption. I think the reserves would be
for the purpose of taking care of losses that
certain persons engaged in the regulated industry had to suffer in order that the general
and overriding purpose of the scheme might

550

SENATE

be carried out. Such losses may arise, not
immediately, but at a future date, and the
reserves would be only sufficient to take
care of them on a proper accounting basis.
It seems to me there would not be any
great need for reserves with respect to other
products than grain. One can readily see
that when the Board is authorized to take
care of losses that are incurred only because
of the operations of the legislation-not
losses related to poor quality, for instanceit is necessary to make provision for the
creation of reserves.
Subsection 7 was agreed to.
Subsection 8 was agreed to.
On section 5-marketing schemes:
Subsections 1 and 2 were agreed to.
On subsection 3-Minister may recommend
approval:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is the
subsection to which I wish to move an
amendment.
I will not repeat the reasons
I have given for the amendment, but I
desire to ad.d one further argument. This
experiment may have a far-reaching effect.
It is, I believe, at the outset, when the
first attempts at regulation are being made,
that Parliament should be especially careful not to abandon its control. Parliament
will be particularly interested in the early
development of the scheme and the activities
of the boards that are appointed shortly
after the legislation becomes effective. If
we wish to provide every possible chance
of success for this experiment, we should
make sure that it starts off with the blessing
of Parliament as a whole. We all know that
the membership of the House of Commons
changes at each general election.
If my
amendment were accepted the people would,
I believe, feel reassured by the knowledge
that their elected representatives would be
able to pass upon any scheme and modify it,
if modification were deemed advisable. Therefore I move the following amendment to
subsection 3 of section 5:
Add after the word "and" in the thirtyfourth line the following words: "may then lay
before Parliament that scheme, and if Parliament resolves that the scheme shall be
approved, the Governor in Council may."
The latter part of the subsection will then
read:
upon the recommendation of approval by the
Minister, the Governor in Couneil may approve
the scheme and may then lay before Parliament
that secheme. and if Parliament resolves that
the scheme shall be approved, the Governor in
Council nay fix the date when the same shall
become effective.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yesterday the
honourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) intimated that the British Act contained a provision of this character. I admit
quite frankly I was surprised. It did not seem
to me quite in accord with the principles of
legislation and administration that after Parliament had approved of a general plan details of its application should require legislative approval, on the assumption that Parliament was a better judge than would be those
charged with the administration of the Act.
However, I accept my honourable friend's
citation.
What I want to emphasize now is that the
positions of the two countries are radically
different. England is a tight little island, and
agricultural conditions there are practically
uniform throughout the whoie country.
Even if conditions here were the same as in
Great Britain, this would not in my opinion
be good legislation. I do not see how the
members of Parliament could be as weli
qualified or in as good a position to judge
of the merits and workability of a scheme
for a particular industry as are 'the Minister
and the officials of the department, who are
living with the industry all the time. How
could Parliament, representing the whole
Dominion, pass intelligently on the merits of
a plan for marketing the apples of British
Columbia or the potatoes of Prince Edward
Island?
Would we seriously compare the
value of our conclusion with the value of
the conclusion of men who are familiar with
the industry? We could not reach as intelligent a decision. The conditions of one
industry in one territory differ so much from
those of the same industry in a territory three
thousand miles away that it would seem to
me to be by no means wise or prudent legislation to require the imprimatur of Parliament on the details of an individual case in
order to give effect to the legislation.
There is still another contrast. In Great
Britain Parliament sits virtually the year
round; there is only a short recess. But on
the average we sit five months in each year,
usually less. So there would be an interval
of seven months when everything would be
tied up. Nothing could be done, because of
the necessity of submitting to the senators
from Ontario some question about the apples
of the Annapolis Valley or the potatoes of
Prince Edward Island.
I do not think the honourable senator will
on reflection insist on his amendment. On
the suggestion he advanced last night I made
no remarks. hoping that locus poenitentiæ
would be of value to the honourable senator.

JUNE 15, 1934
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw my
right honourable friend's attention to this
feature. The people of the old provinces of
Canada and the Maritimes have for two
centuries and more been developing along
well defined individualistic lines. Every man
has heen master of his domain. We are now
passing to a system of eompulsory co-operation. I fear the result of the assumption by
the Government of responsibility for imposing
the proposed legislation upon an unwilling
minority. I believe that while the scheme is
being gradually developed the full authority
of Parliament is needed. If the principle of
the Bill can be applied satisfactorily, Parliament will gradually relax its control. Since
it is admitted, even by those who have sponsored 'the Bill, that it is largely an experiment, it seems to me that the authority of
Parliament should be invoked while the
scheme is being developed, in order that the
people may be assured that their representatives have approved the details of each
specific case.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is quite right; Parliament
must give its approval. The measure iq an
experiment and contains certain features that
are somewhat unusual. For myself, I do not
think the proposed legislation will bring about
a new heaven and a new earth, nor do I think
it is going to be injurious in operation. I
should like to see it rtried. I do believe there
is a very substantial demand for it in relation
to cattle, fruit and some dairy products. But
my honourable friend says Parliament should
pass on the details of each specific case and
by resolution implement those details if
thought advisable. Does he realize what
would be the result? Suppose that in July
some modification is necessary: ,those administering the Act are tied hand and foot, they
cannot do anything, until Parliament has
assented to the modification. It seems to me
this is impracticable.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The best way
would be to do what was done with wheat this
afternoon. If we had not amended the section in a way that I believe will receive the
commendation of those most interested, this
measure would have contained something that
might have been very injurious to the West.
I point this out to show that the approval
of Parliament is a pretty good safeguard.
Parliament is composed of men from every
section of the Dominion. It is not as if a
few Ontario senators could tinker with a
scheme set up by British Columbia. That
province is well represented in the House of

551

Commons and in this Chamber, and indeed in
any Government. It does seem to me that,
particularly in the initial stages of what is
admitted to be a doubtful experiment, the
people would be better satisfied if they knew
their representatives in Parliament had an
opportunity to examine any scheme that a
few persons in a community might desire to
set up.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Would that not
have the effect of preventing any progress from
being made? Every scheme put forward
would have to wait until the next session of
Parliament before it could be approved and
put into operation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my honourable friend will find that the central board
will scarcely have been organized and set in
motion before next winter's snow appears.
It is highly improbable that the putting into
operation of any single scheme would be delayed before next session. We sit for five
months. We have been living under the
present system for a century or more, and
there is no need for hasty action. Time will
show whether the scheme will succeed. I
believe the father, the Parliament of Canada,
should watch over the birth of the first child.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was negatived.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall submit
it again on third reading.
Subsection 3 of section 5 was agreed to.
Subsections 4 and 5 were agreed to.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Reverting to subsection 3 of section 5, am I correct in understanding that a poll is not necessary unless
the Minister so orders?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I s'o read the
subsection. Undoubtedly if there is any substantial objection to the plan the Minister
will call for a poll, because that will be his
defence. He fixes the percentage, and I
should think he would be disposed to place it
pretty high.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: And -if a scheme is
established by poll it must be abolished by
poll?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The CHAIRMAN: Is there any further
comment on section 5? Then we will proceed.
Sections 6 and 7 were agreed to.

SENATE

On section 8--approval of proposals for extension, amalgamation, and new local boards:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Under this
clause there can be, and doubtless will be, if
it succeeds, a simplification of the whole plan,
reducing greatly the number of boards.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
That of course
applies to the amalgamation of boards already established.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
Is it within the
power of the Board to amalgamate two or
three different boards situated in different
provinces?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
Suppose we have
a board established by the Dominion in each
of the Maritime Provinces, for the handling
of one crop, say potatoes: is there any provision in the Bill under which the boards can
be amalgamated into one board for that
district?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The local boards
are named under enabling legislation of the
provinces. Must it be provided in that legislation that they may be amalgamated?
The local
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
governments do not come in under this
clause. The Governor in Council has to be
satisfied-on the recommendation of the Minister, that
a majority of the persons engaged in the production or marketing of a natural product so
require.
You will notice this does not say "regulated
product." If it did, it would not be practicable, because such a product is regulated
by a specifie scheme. If the Governor in
Council is satisfied, he may approve of a
proposal for(a) the extension of the geographical limits
of any part of Canada to which an existing
scheme relates;
(b) the extension of the powers of any local
board;
(c) the amalgamation of two or more local
boards;
(d) the creation of a new local board to
regulate the marketing of a product already
subject to regulation by one or more existing
local boards.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN.

That is to say, if the production of potatoes
in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick is regulated, and if the Governor in Council is of
the opinion that the potato growers would
rather have complete regulation, he can
establish a board for Prince Edward Island.
That is what is meant by the clause, as I
read it. That would be necessary, would it
not?
Much advantage in handling the
potato exports of two of those provinces
might be lost if one province were to stay
out. It is not likely that any of them would
want to do su. There is no reference to
local governments, because this does not
regulate anything under the purview of the
local governments; it regulates only the
export.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I understand that
in the enabling legislation already passed one
of the Maritime Provinces bas gone so far
as to name the board. Now, if it be found
necessary to amalgamate three boards handling the same product, has the central board
power to say that the named board, the provincial board, shall function with the boards
in the neighbouring provinces, and that there
shall be one board?
The honRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very well;
even if it has; what the honourable member
wants to know is whether the 'Governor in
Council under this clause 8 can force amalgamation on the two boards created by the
two provinces. Yes. But it is tu be remembered that the creation of these boards by
the two provinces does not make them boards
under this Act. We will presume, then, that
steps are taken to make them local boards
under this Act. The amalgamation would
affect only the powers given by the federal
statute. They could do only what this Act
empowers them to do.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: As a matter of fact,
do not the federal authorities name their
board as well?

JUNE 15, 1934
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, they
do, and they would probably select the board
named by the local government. But suppose they did not: the Federal Government
could refuse to have duplicate boards.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In every case?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In every
case. In any event, I think you will find
the Governor in 'Countil has power to name
the board, and that he will say this apphies
only to the board already created.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Section 10 covers
that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
clause I refer to.
Whenever a soheme of regulation relates to
an area of production which is confined within
the limits of a province, the Governor in
Council may authorize any marketing board or
agency established under the law of -the said
province to be, and to exercise the functions
of, a local -board with reference to the said
Beheme.

Section 8 was agreed to.
Sections 9, 10 and 11 were agreed to.
On section 12-restriction of imports and
exports:

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: This is the N.R.A.

it?

I have not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Parliament of control of the import and export policy of this country.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Paragraph

Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Paragraph b deals

Imports,
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
exports and reports-there are three classes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is a clause
which I think vests the executive of Parliament with powers that should remain in
Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course
the whole purpose of the Bill is to regulate
export in natural products. If the honourable gentleman is right in what he says, the
Bill should be defeated.
It may be necessary at times to regulate
importation. This deals only with natural
products, and for the life of me I cannot see
who is going to benefit by a restriction of
the import of natural products unless it is
the producer of natural products, and we
are not likely to prevent him from receiving
benefits. If there is one class that needs ail
the benefits available, it is the producers of
natural products.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman claims that the right may
well be given to the Governor in Council.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You could
not have this Bill without control of exportation. For example, the idea is to prevent the flooding of the British market with
apples, or cheese, at the wrong time, and
to prevent the wrong cheese or the wrong
apples from getting to that market. That

DEFENCE OF CANADA'SEA-BORNE
TRADE
INQUIRY-DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

On 'the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the question proposed by Hon. Mr. Griesbach:
To eall the attention of the Government to
the question of thie olefence of the sea-borne
trade of Canada, and te inquire of thie Government what steps it proposes to take te poeovide
adequately for the defence of the sea-borne
trade of Canada.-Hn. Mr. MeLennan.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would thc
honourable senater fromn Sydney (Hon. Mr.
MeLennan) object if we moved the adjournment of the House now? My reason for
making this suggestion is that the Banking
and Commerce Committee, wbich is considering the Excise Act, is to meet immediately
at the close of this sitting. It is nearly 6
e dlock now, and a.9 a member of the Committee I should like to have aomething done
on that measure to-day.
Hon. J. S. MoLFiNNAN: I amrn ot likely
to take up more than five minutes.
Right Hon. Mr. MFJIGHEN: There ie of
course no objection to continuing the debate
now.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I have been considering this matter since it was brought to
the attention of the Hlouse by the honourable

bl

senator frora Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach). The defence of sea-borne trade is one
of the most serious problems that can face
this or any other country. It has to do with
our national safety and development, and the
retaining of one of the most precious assets
that any nation can possess, namely, its
sovereignty. The problem is complicated because, in the first place, it deals with intricate.
points which are tied up with events that
reach far back into the history of our national
life, and, in the second place, it is necessarily
concerned with future events.
The future of any country is uncertain, for
existing conditions may be changedi in a most
extraordinary way over a period of years.
The people of any nation may make a wrong
guess when deciding to take a specifie course
upon a matter having to do with years to
corne. And I thjnk that evil is sometimes
done by the consideration of affairs which
the passage of tirne proves to have been
absolutely unimportant. Such questions as
the one now before us, which. have no basis
in current events, and so lack reality, are apt
to make trouble by creating wrong impressions.
We are under obligation to the honourable
gentleman fromn Edmonton for directing our
attention to the great value, and effect of our
overseas commerce. And we axe indebted to
the honourable, gentleman from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) for the interesting information he gave us as to events we may have
imagined to 'happen, but as to which we bad
no definite knowledge.
I wish to advert to the thoroughness with
which the rnilitary mind goes into any matter
that it places under consideration. If the
mili'tary aim is security, that means absolute
security. But there is no condition in li-fe
with respect to which absolute security can
be provided. If you want to make the streets
of a city absolutely safe for pedestrian traffie,
every wheel must stop turning. We .must take
chances. Bernard Shaw, not I, first put it in
that way.
At the outbreak of the Great War there
were near Sydney Harbour and along the
adjacent coast two steel works that had been
producing every year several hundred thonsand tons of steel; and stretching along the
adjacent shore were a group of collieries whose
annual output of coal totalled millions of tons.
Within a time that might be counted in weeks,
the Nova Scotia Steel Company, as it then
wa;s called, proved to the British military
authorities that the steel it made was as satisfactory for war purposes as was that which
the Imperial Goverument had been able to

556

SENATE

import in only limited quantities and at an
exorbitantly high price. The gentleman who
established that proof was Colonel Cantley,
who is now a member of the other House.
And the late J. H. Plummer, the then President of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, demonstrated to the authorities that his
concern could produce toluol, the essential
element of T.N.T., which is the basis of high
explosives. Within a few weeks one of these
Nova Scotia plants was producing the basic
steel which was used in the manufacture of
millions of shells, and the other had a creditable output of toluol.
If a German cruiser hid come through the
chops of the channel, even though she sacrificed berself, she could have first destroyed,
from a deep water position where she would
have been perfectly safe, those steel works
and the range of collieries which were supplying coal te them and to our ships. No such
daring raid was made, but honourable members can easily imagine the serious effect that
might have been brouglit about at the time.
I entirely dissent fronm the suggestion by
the honourable gentleman from Edmonton
tîat Canada is treading the primrose path.
I admit that the primrose path is dangerous
and enervating. but the fact is tîat since
the first white man settled on the shores of
the St. Lawrence, or in Nova Scotia, the
course followed by Canada bas never been
an easy one. In every decade she bas found
it necessary te make brave decisions and
carry out difficult tasks, and so far she bas
never failed to acquit herself proudly.
I submit, honourable niembers, that in diseussing a question of this kind we should
make no reference to what one party or another has donc, or w'hether one industry or
another would have been benefited Ny a
certain course. Our object should be to consider the interests of the country at large,
and to meet existing problems in the same
spirit as that which has enabled Canada te
carry on so successfully in the past.
QUEBEC

SAVINGS
SECOND

BANKS

BILL

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 33, an Act to amend
the Quebec Savings Banks Act.
He said: Honourable members, I understand this measure provides for the decennial
renewal of the charters of savings banks in
Quebec.
The honourable senator opposite
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) knows far more about
the matter than I do.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This relates
te the general Act under which savings banks
in Quebec operate. It comes up for review
every ten years, as does the Bank Act, under
wbich the commercial banks receive their
charters. Formerly there were a number o(
savings banks throughout the province, bw
gradually some have been absorbed by other
banks or by the Post Office, and to-day there
remain but two, one in the city of Montreal
and the other in the city of Quebec. I suppose this Bill will be sent on to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
that any changes in the Bank Act are reflected in this measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

EXCISE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 89, an Act to anend and
consolidate the Excise Act, and moved concurrence therein.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Is there only

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Yes. Aecording to the officers of the department, the
words "seized as," inserted in line 45 before
the word "forfeited," form the correct phrase,
"seized as forfeited," used elsewhere in the
Bill. These words fit into the new section
169A, giving the innocent party claiming te
have un interest, aside from that of the
offender, in the property seized as forfeited, an
opportunity to prove his case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am in sympathy with the amendment. I beard the discussion before the standing committee and
feIt that in simple justice something should
Ne done to relieve the innocent victim of the
seizure.

JUNE 19, 1934
I sec subsection 2 provides:
If, after such notice to the Commissioner as
the judge may require, it is made to appear
to the satisfaction of such judge,
(a) that the claimant is innocent of any
complicity in the offence resulting in sueh
seizure or of any collusion with the offender
in relation thereto and
(b) that he exercised all reasonable care in
the choice of the person permitted to obtain
the possession of such horses, vehicles, vessels
or other appliances to satisfy himsef that they
were not likely to be used contrary to the
provisions of this Act or, if a mortgagee or
lien-holder, that the vendor to the mortgagor or
lien-giver exercised such care; he shall be entitled to an order that his interest be not
affected by such seizure.
Could the right honourable gentleman tell the
House what he would deem to be the "reasonable care" that should be exercised by the
person selling or having a lien on the property?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In order that
this may be understandable to honourable
members who were not on the com'mittee,
perhaps I bad better lay a foundation. Section 169 originally provided that anyone who
had in his possession, or who removed from
any distillery, bonded warehouse or bonded
manufactory, spirits or liquors upon which
duty or excise had not been paid, was guilty
of an offence and liable to punishment according to the provisions of the section. It
further provided that all horses, vehicles, vessels or other appliances used in the removal
of such liquors should be forfeited to the
Crown. It was felt, however, that this probably referred only to removal from distilleries, bonded warehouses and 'bonded manufactories; so the section was amended in the
House of Commons to include vehicles and
so forth used in the transport of such liquor
to any place, maybe weeks afterwards, or
purely by accident.
In that farm the section met with the
criticism-whch I take the respansibility of
having initiated-that frequently persons
other than the 'alleged offender were interested
in the vehicle used. The vehicle mainly used
now is the automobile. If may be that a man
leds his car to some person who lends it to
someone else; or it is possible that, quite
honestly, he hires it out. Nevertheless, entirely aside from his guilt or innocence, the
car would be forfeited to the Crown. Further
it was pointed out that very often automobiles are sold on what is called the instalment
system; that automobile manufacturers make
use of finance companies for the collection of
instalments, and that sùch companies purchase the instalment papers and become the

557

mortgagees of the property. The practice has
been to forfeit that property to the Crown,
irrespective of the interest of the pledgee,
and regardless of the fact that he is innocent
of any offence.
It was urged before the committee on behalf of the department that the law h'ad to
be very stringent and severe, even to the
extent of confiscating property of people in
no way participating in the offence. Because
of the difficulty of enforcing the Act there
grew up a .doctrine of applying the wording
of the Act to the automobile. In fact, the
statement appears in the judgment of one
of the judges of a higher court that the law
contemplates the guilt of the machine, and
consequently its forfeiture. I presume that
doctrine had to be educed in order to
describe the conduct of Parliament in imposing forfeiture and punishment on people
who were obeying the law, and in fact doing
everything that good citizens are called upon
to do.
It was recognized in the com'mittee that in
order to enable the officers of the law to
enforce this very difficult statute we ought to
go as far as possible without making it absolutely 'necessary that property of people
innocent off any offence should be seized as
forfeited to the Crown. Consequently this
amendment was adopted. It provides that
any person other than the offender is entitled
to protection if he claims to be the owner,
pledgee, mortgagee, or lien-holder, and can
f urnish proof that he is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of collusion with the
offender, and also-and this is a very unusual
onus to put on a man who is merely seeking
to regain his own property-that he took
reasonable care to make certain that the
permission given by him for the use of his
vehicle was not illegal; or that the vendor
whose lien he has purchased exercised such
care. If the man who claims the return of
his property discharges that onus he is
entitled to the property.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not sec why
an automobile should be seized any more than
a house in which contraband liquor is found.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I admit that
in point of logic there is no distinction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under the present Act a railway train could be seized.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.

the marketing of their produet. A special
board could not improve on present methods
of marketing; indeed it would tend to raise
various difficulties and undermine the independent spirit of our noble fishermen.
What the Maritime Provinces need is the
restoration of the open market of the United
States. This market was closed in 1921 by the
Fordney Tariff Bill, after the persistent refusai of the Canadian people to acpt reciprocity. Since the advent of the "God-elected

I now move, seconded by the honourable
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair):
'Tbat the said Bitl be amended by inserting in
line 21 of section 2. after the word "river." the
following words: "except the prodiucts of the
sea of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island."
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK:
What body of
fishermen made the representaitions to the
honourable gentleman on which lie bases his
amendment?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: The fisliermen of
Gloucester and the neighbouring counties.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
my first comment on the amendment is this. I do not think you can define
the sea of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or
Prince Edward Island. We know wbat constitute our territorial waters within the threemile limit, but there is no limit to the sea
coast of a province. What is the sea of New
Brunswick as distinguished from the sea of
Quebec? I do not think there is a line of
demarcation.
We speak of the sea of a
countrv, not of a province. But that is more
or less technical, though it is important.
The honourable gentleman supports his
amendment by a brief on the merits and good
citizenship of the fishermen -of the Maritime
Provinces. I quite concede it would bc a
terrible thing to take from them any rights
that they lawfully exercise. But, if the honourable gentleman will reflect, T think he will

TURGEON.

agree that the apple growers of the Annapolis Valley are also good citizens. They have
used their natural resources for the benefit
of their province and the Dominion as a
wliole. They bave developed a great industry and have shown themselves to be a very
imiport'ant section of our community.
The honourable gentleman apparently bas
some idea that this is a visitation of legislative providence on offenders; that it is in the
nature of penal legislation. This legislation
is intended not to injure anybody, but to
offer help to those engaged in tihe production
and marketing of natural products, and to
offer it on the basis of their expressed desire.
The honourable senator from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Molloy) moved an amendment
excepting grain. Perhaps that lias set in train
a number of other ideas. As he said, we already have an Act which takeis care of the
marketing of grain, an Act built up on forty
years of experience, and amended from year
to year for four decades-one of the most
completely developed pieces of legislation on
the Statute Book. Why, then, give the Government the right virtually to repeal that law
and bring the grain trade under some other
law? There is no such special legislation having to do with marketing of fish.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Does the Grain Act
give the Grain Commission power to sell?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. It
provides the macbinery, the system of grading and marketing, and the channels of sale.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: But the
Commission do not buy nor sell?

Grain

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. There
was at hast that ground for the motion of
thïe honourable member from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Melley); but I do not see ýany
similar ground in relation to fisli. It is hardly
coneeivable that the Government would bring
the fish of the Maritime Provinces or any
natural product under the provisions of this
Bill except at the request of the producers.
Thi.s Bill gives those people the opportunity
to have their product landled in a certain
way if they think it will bring about better
results. Why deny the fishermen that right?
If they do not want it they will not get it.
Why say to them, "Here is machinery which
others may take advantage of, but you cannot benefit 'by"? I do not think the honourable gentlenan would want that sect-ion of
the population to be treated in such a manner under the law.
Further, I understand that fish were not at
first ineluded, but were brought into this

that at ieast t'hey had a right ta decide whether or flot ta presý>ent ta, the Minister a

vessels, witb crews ranging from twenty-five
ta tbirty men, saiied out of the port of
Lunenburg; last year twenty-two sbîps saiied
out of tbat port. The shore fishermen,
especially in tbe province of Nova Scotia.
are iooking with ho>pe ta this new hegisiation,
and in view of the fact tbat an investigation
is being carried on now on behaif of the
Committee on Price Spreads and Mass Buying, 1 tbink it wouid be most unfortunate,
and possibiy disastrous ta the fisbing industry
in Nova Scotia, ta exelude tbat industry from
tbe Bill. There are 16,000 fishermen in the
province of Nova Scatia. Last year many of
them earned less tban $300, and in the littie
baribours aiong tbe coast bundreds of families
were kept aiive during the winter by publie
relief. To-day, because of the disastrous
storms of hast winter, many of tbem are
witbout vessels or gear, and the situation
this year is not tao brigbt. As a matter of
fact, a campaign is now being conducted in
Nova Seotia ta fix a minimum price for fish
in tbat province. I hope, therefore, this honourable body will flot pass this amendment,
especiaily witb respect ta the province of
Nova Scotia.
The amendmnent of Hon. Mr. Turgeon was
nega-tived.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourabie members, I wish ta eaul the attention of tbe
flouse ta section 8 of the Bill. I do not;
cieariy understand it, nor do I understand
tbe expianatian given by the right bonourable the leader of this flouse, wbose explanations are usuaily very cicar.

REVISED EDITON

SENATE
When the Bill was in Committee of the
Whole the Chairman gave an explanation
which appears on page 553 of Hansard of
June 15, and which reads as follows:
What section 8 means is that, provided the
Governor in Council is satisfied -that a majority
of the producers of potatoes, say, in the Maritime Provinces, desire a central board, the
But,
three boards may be amalgamated.
whether they were amalgarnated or not, if the
provinces did not agree the federal authority
would have power to appoint a central board,
provided a majority wanted it.
I wish to make the following observations.
The soil and climate of Prince Edward Island
appear to be very well adapted to the production of potatoes, and by reason of careful attention to seed, to cultivation and to
grading, that province now produces, and
has produced for some years past, a very
superior article which conmands a premium
in the markets of Canada and the United
States. What bothers me is this. If one
board had jurisdiction over the marketing of
potatoes of the Maritime Provinces, would
there be a danger that we of Prince Edward
Island might lose the excellent position we
have achieved after some years of effort?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am aware
of the seed potato business, as I think it is
called, in Prince Edward IslandHon. Mr. HUGHES: Seed and table stock.

if the Governor in Council is satisfied that
the majority desire it, two or more local
boards can be amalgamated. If he is satisfied that the majority desire the amalgamation of the two boards of Prince Edward
Island and New Brunswick, they can be
amalgamated, and the amalgamated board
will operate in future and will have full
powers, so far as this Act can give them;
and probably will have also full local powers
as given by the provincial governments.
There may be one board for the whole of
the Maritime Provinces. But that does not
mean that every potato marketed by that
board will bring the same price as the rest.
The objective of the board is to get the best
price obtainable for all grades. Grading would
certainly be continued. It is utterly inconceivable that the advantage due to high
quality would ever be wiped out. You tannot preserve quality unless you preserve the
extra price.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is the point, and
it is very important.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is very
important. That is the fact. I do not know
that my opinion in regard to potatoes is very
valuable-the opinion of the Minister of
Agriculture would be vastly more so-but I
should think that the essence of this legisiation is quality and the maintenance of our
reputation in the markets of the world; and

JUNE 19, 1934
Prince Edward Island engaged in the potato
business will themselves decide whether they
are to bave their own marketing board or go
in with a marketing board that operates for
the other two, provinces.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: 1 was clear enougb in
my own mind on that point, and I thougbt
1 stated my understanding plainly. In the
first place, tbe people of Prince Edward Island
wi]1 flot have to, corne under a board at al
unles the mai ority of the potato growers want
to do so.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In that province?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: There will be a board
only if the mai ority of the people want it.
It will be a maj ority of the potato growers in
Prince Edward Island, or New Brunswick, or
any other province, wbo suggeot that a board
be formed. The suggestion will not corne
from the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does this section
contemplate the possibi1lity of amalgamating
a potato marketing board in Prince Edward
Island with an apple board in Nova Scotia?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: I cannot say
that the section forbids it, but there is no
need tbat tbey sbould be amalgarnated,
because the produets are not at aIl in the same
line, and tbpre is no likelibood that the producers would want an amalgamation.
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK: Do the words
"natural produet," in tbe fourtb line, govern?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. ME'IGHEN: Yes, I sbould
tbink so. Consequently there could be an
amalgamation only of boards dealing witb a
naturel produet.
Hon. Mr. MUR.DOCK: Dealing with any
one naturel produet?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Dealing with
any one natural product, I sbould think. But
I do not want to be dogmatic on that, because
it is conceivable that one board might deal
with several natural products. For instance,
in the Okanagan Valley there would not be
one board dealing with apples, another with
pears and another with peaches. Fruit is a
combination of several natural products, and
I presumne that if there were an apple board
it would deal with peaches and pears as well.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The same board could
deal witb pigs, could it not?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presumne it
could, but I think that would not happen.
The honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) is right in suggesting tbat the
7472"-6.1

563

section contemplates that a board bandling
one natural product may be amalgamated witb
a board handling another natural produet,
but I should tbink that the naturel product in
eacb instance might be sume kind of fruit.
In any event, the producers make the
selection.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: How would the poIl
of the people engaged in an industry be taken?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The method
of taking the poil would be provided by the
regulations that are to be promulgated. I
presumne that everybody producing a certain
quantity of goods in any district will he required to register, so that when the registrations bave been made the board will know
j ust who are engaged in the various industries. Provision will probably be made for
ascertaining the wishes of aIl those persons who
are registered fromn any district, wben it is
suggested tbat a board be formed for tbat
dstrict.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It seems to me that
so far as Prince Edward Island is concerned
it would be mucb simpler to get an expression of opinion from the Provincial Government, for it represents everybody there. Fourfiftbs of the people in that province are
growing potatoes, iii large or small quantities.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I ask the
right honourable gentleman this question?
If a local board were organized for the
marketing of potatoes in New Brunswick, and
a similar board were set up in Prince Edward
Island, would each board be supreme in its
field, or wouîd the actions of each he controiled by the central board with a view to
harmonizing tbem?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
to each part of the honourable gentleman's
question is in the affirmative. Each board
would be supreme, yet each would be under
the governance of the overriding provisions.
But those overriding provisions would neyer
prevent either board from getting superior
prices for superior quality.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Nor from maintaining
the identity of the products?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN. Nor from
maintaining the identity. The function of the
central board will be to harmonize the work
of one board with that of another, but the
work of the individuel boards will not be
destroyed. Furthermore, the benefit of the
general experience will be availabie to each
s'ction.

SENATE

564

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then each local
board will be restricted in its movements as to
the time and place at which, and the agency
through which, the regulated product shall be
marketed, and as to the manner of distribution and the quantity, quality and grade or
class of the regulated product. The freedom
of action of the local board will be limited
by the general ruling of the central board,
permitting or prohibiting sales during a certain
period, with a view to the best marketing
conditions and prices. The boards dealing
with the same product -in New Brunswick and
Prince Edward Island, for instance, would be
controlled by the central board, and because
of obeying certain general regulations they
would function in some respects as though
they were one board?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: J think that
is correct. It must be borne in mind that the
Governor in Council is not obliged to take
action when the request for a board comes
from too small a portion of an industry. My
own view is that it would not be common
sense to have three boards for the potato industry in the Maritime Provinces. It would
seem to me that those three provinces would
probably be the smallest possible unit that
could possibly operate as one board in relation to that one product. A different arrange-ment would probably cause difficulty, for friction might arise if one province were asked
to withhold sales while the other provinces
were selling. It would be the duty of the
central board to advise as to whether or not
any unit is big enough to function by itself
with respect to any product, while other units
handling the same product are also functioning nearby. It would seem to me to be the
part of wisdom that the handling of any one
product in the Maritime Provinces should be
done by one board.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is where the
danger lies. The potatoes of Prince Edward
Island being of superior quality, the demand
would perhaps be stronger for thom than for
those of the other provinces. If we were
unable to take advantage of that demand we
should be penalized to some extent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The merging
of the boards would not merge the potatoes.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I should be satisfied
if it were made clear that we shall be free to
do the best we can with the product that is
peculiar to Prince Edward Island.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Prince Edward Island does not need to go into the
scheme at all.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is an important
statement, that we do not need to go in at
all.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members, when we were in Commitee J moved
an amendment which was rejected, and I stated
that I would move it again on third reading.
I desire to do so now. Subsection 3 of section 5 reads as follows:
Upon receipt of a report from the Board
recommending the approval of the soheme as
subxmitted or as anended by the Board, the
Minister may recommend the approval thereof,
o.r may require that a poll be taken and state
the necessary percentage of voters favouring the
scheme to warrant its further consideration;
upon the rocommendation of approval by the
.Minister, the Governor in Council may approve
the scheme and fix the date when the same shall
become effective.

I move that this be amended by inserting
after the word "and" and before the word
"fix," in line 34 on page 5 of the Bill, the
following:
may then lay before Parliament that scheme.
and if Parlianent resolves that the scheme shall
be approved, the Governor in Council may.
The discussion to which we have just listened
strengthens my opinion as to the necessity
of such an amendment. As I said on the
motion for second reading, this proposed legisis experimiental, and is far in advance
of any wie have forinerly had for the purpose
of regulating the marketing of natural
products. It seeks to introduce into our
statutes a coercive olement which is entirely
The views expressed by honourable

members this evening show the differences
of opinion that exist as to the working of this
Bill, and prove that some people fear they
may be deprived of that freedom of action
which hitherto they have been able to exercise
as they deemed best in their own interest.
The honourable gentleman from Gloucester
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon) urges that the fishermen
from the part of the country which he represents should not be included in such a scheme
as the Bill contemplates; and opposition to
the Bill has been expressed from the Maritimes.
Radical though the marketing legislation of
Great Britain is. I feel we should be well
advised to follow more closely the policy
adopted in that country. Under that policy
no marketing scheme can be put into operation until it has been approved by both
Houses of Parliament. I believe the people
of our country would be less disturbed over
the possibility of an invasion of their right
to dispose as they please of the products of
their labour, if it were made clear to them

otion

JUNE 19, 1934
that no marketing acharne would be put intooperation until it had been ratified by Parliament. The riglit bonourable leader states
that since our sessions last only about five
montbs each year it is flot always so easy
to obtain the opinion of Pariiament in this
country as it is in Great Britain, wliere the
sessions are usually of nine or ten months'
duration. And hie fears that the problems of
British Columbia, for instance, might flot be
understood by people fromn the East. I sulimit that we need the support and sanction
of Parliament in order to insure the successful
operation of this new venture. If in the next
few years the law works to the satisfaction
of ail, inciuding the minorities who at prasent
may lie in opposition to it, parliamnentary
approval may become a perfunctory matter.
But I arn convinced that more ground will
lie gained at the outset if we folýlow the
practice adopted under the British Act of
1931, requiring that before an-y scheme under
that Act can become operative it shall be
approved by Parliament. My amendment is
seconded 'by the honourable senator from De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain).
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I bave
already expressed myseif on this matter, I
will not make any extended remarks at this
time. But I do not wish to lie discourteous
to the honourable gentleman by failing to
make any reply to bis argument. For reasons
already given I consider that the amendment is merely negative and that it would
render the whle Bill utterly nugatory and
futile.
The amendrnant of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was negatived.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
is now on the third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I desire to point
out to the riglit honourable gentleman that
when the Bill was in Committee last Friday
hie promised the House certain information
on two or three matters. I think we are
entitled to that information.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I amn ve.ry
glad that the honourable -gentleman has mentioned the point. I had it in mnd- two or
tliree limes this evening.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Before the riglit
honourable gentleman proceedes, may I refer
to a statement made last Friday by the
Chairman of the Committee, and not noticed
by me until I read it in Hansard. He said it
had lieen stated in another place-which I
presume meant the other House of Parliament-that the central board wouid lie comnposed of officiais of the Department of

565

Agriculture. I should like to ask the right
bonourable leader if lie lias any information
in that connection.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The lionourable Chairman of the Committee (Hon. Mr.
Black) understood that from the talk lie
had with the Minister.
.Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
in Parliament?

It was not stated

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I amn
disposed- to think lie meant the salaried
officiais would lie the present officers. I do
not tliink lie meant there would lie noliody
else associated with the central board.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: As members of tlie
bioard?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
He may
have meant tliat, but I do not understand so.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Wlien tlie riglit
honourable gentleman says "officers," cloas
lie mean officiais or members?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Officiais.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Here is the statament:The Chairanan: It was stated in antother
place that the central board wouid lie made up
of officiais now in the exniloy of the Department of Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I have nothing to add
to or retract from that statemant. "Another
place" does not necassarily mean another
Chamber of Parliament. In answer to a
question whether it would be necessary to
bave a large number of officiais, tlie Minister
stated that in bis opinion there wera a suffidient number in tbe departmnent now to carry
on the central board.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEýN: I arn not
sure whetlier lie meant to carry on tlie work
of the board as officiais or as members.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
Tbat is a very
important point.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: It is important in the administration, but it doca not
reaily affect the mrerits of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It affects tlie cost
of administration.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But not the principle of tlie Bili-wbich is no good.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I hope they
wil lie able to <'arr on witb the present
officiais, but I cannot give an undertaking
to that effect.

SENATE

While I am on my feet I want to give
answers which were promised to questions
brought up by the honourable senator frem
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair). One had to do
with the licence fees to be charged under this
Bill. The other related to some understanding or information with respect to the Fruit
and Honey Act. This is the memorandum,
dated June 18, which I have received from
the Deputy Minister of Agriculture:
Licence fees under the Natural Products
Marketing Act will have to be determined in
the case of each product to which they are
intended to apply. It is expected that when
provision for licences is a part of a marketing
schemie, the amount of fees proposed for such
licences will be included in the scheme.
That is, in the scheme proposed to the department by the local people engaged in it.
'The proposed fees. as well as other provisions
of the scheme, will of course be subject to
examination by the Dominion Marketing Board,
reciommendation by the Minister, and approval
by Governor in Council. It is not intended that
regulation will be affected by the amount of the
fee.
Does that apply
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
to section 12?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To the whole
Act, according to this memorandum.
Sucls fees should net inean any hardship te
those who may require a licence.
The second paragraph has to do with the
Fruit and Honey Act:
With reference to licence fees un'der the Fruit
and Honey Act no final decision bas yet bcen
made. It is probable that the fees will range
from $5 to $30, depending upon the character
of the business for which the licence is issued.
Fifty dollars vas proposed in the first draft of
the regulations, bot these are being revised.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The right honourable gentleman will remember that information was also to be brought down with
regard to the assessment of tolls; whether
the power was in the local board, or the central board could delegate it to the local board.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think tolls
are in the same category as licence fees; they
would have to carry the judgment of the
Marketing Board and as well of the Minister and the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is satisfactory.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
is on the third reading of the Bill.

SHIPPING BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS REFERRED TO
COMMITTEE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
members, a message bas been received fromo
the House of Connons returning Bill E, an
Act respecting Shipping, with several amendments to which they desire the concurrence of
the Senate. When shall these amendients
be taken into consideration?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the House of Commons made
twenty-five amendments to this Bill, which is
a small number of proposed changes when
spread over such an immense measure.
Twenty-four of them are purely clerical; they
have no effect other than by way of clerical
corrections. The other five are of some
material importance, and I will refer to them
briefly. I presume it will not be necessary
for me to quote the numbers of sections that
are affected.
The first amendment has to do with the
definition of a home trade voyage, and provides that this definition shall include a voyage
wbich takes in Hudson Bay. That is to say,
a home trade voyage would not become a
foreign voyage merely because the ship went
north and into Hudson Bay.
The second amendment deals with the
measurement that is made of a vessel for the
purpose of deciding whether it shall come within certain exemptions. The Bill provided a
system of measurement by horse-power for
sailing vessels with auxiliary mechanical power,
and declared that a boat with more than four
horse-power should not come within the

JUNE 20, 1934

exemptions. The amendiment adopts tonnage
instead of horse-power as the standard of
measurement for such vessels.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Quite properly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bull as
it lef t here provided that the certificates of
masters, and I think also of mates, should expire in five years, the purpose being to facilitate the work of the department in keeping
records up to date as to officers who had died.
The amendment abolishes this automatic
expiration of the certificates and provides
instead that the Minister may cancel any
certificate upon cause being shown, after
înquiry before a summary court as providkd
for in the measure. No certificate may be
cancelled before the court has reported.
Under the fourth amendment a seaman,
on his discharge, may ask for a certificate of
character to be endorsed on his discharge
paper. If hie makes such a requcst the master
is bound to endorse the paper, favourably or

otherwise. No doubt a seaman would not ask
for an endorsation unless hie feit it would be
favourable.
The intention of one clause in the Bill is to
enable the Minister to mnake safety regulations, as for instance against the speeding of
racing boats at summer resorta. The final
amendment of importance provides that the
power of the Minister in this respect shahl be
Iimitcd to the making of regulations affecting
minor waters only.
Inasmuch as this Bill originated in the
Senate and bas been the subject, of very carefuI attention, I think it would be proper to
submit these amendments to a committee. 1
therofore move that the amendments be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

1. What is the total cost, wit-hout interest
during construction, of the Labour Temple
erected at Geneva by the International Labour
Office?
2. When was construction work commenced?
3. When was the Temple completed and
occupied?
4. Ras the Temple bee-n paid for, and if not,
howý much is outstanding and owing on the
building?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have the
aoswer here.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Theýre is a great
deal of work to be done in dealing with bills,
and I do not want to impede the .progress of
the House in these matters. I therefore ask
that this inquiry stand until next Wednesday,
June 27.
The inquiry stands.

CAP ROUGE RIVER VIADU-CT
Be fore the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Honourable members,
I noticed in the Ottawa Citizen of this morning that estima-tes were passed in the House
of Commons yesterday providing- for a programme of public works, among which I find
the following:
Montreal-Appi ication of two protective coats
of paint on the steel structure of the harbour
bridge, $60,000.
Recently I passed near Cap Rouge in the
company of a man whýo has considerable
knowledge of steel, and hie called my attention to the fact that the Cap Rouge river
viaduct, which carnies the transcontinental
railway tracks, is in a rusty condition and
badly deteriorated from lack of paint. This
structure is very important to the railway and
the country, and to allow it to faîl into a
worse state of repair would be bad policy.
Since the Goverument is going to spend
money on painting the harbour bridge in
Montreal, I should like to a.sk the right
honourable leader of the House if hie would
direct the attention of the Government to
the necessity for painting the Cap Rouge
river viaduct.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
the provision for painting the Montreal bridge
was included in the Bill that was brought
down in the other House hast night. I certainly shaîl call the attention of the Government to the particular case to which the
honourable member refers.
MEAT AND CANNED'FOODS BILL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

SEINATE
Explain.

REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I explained
the Bill yesterday. After it passes second
reading I shall move that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman why all bills are
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce? Surely there are other
standing committees to which this and similar bills may be referred. The Banking and
Commerce Committee has been very heavily
worked this session, and I would suggest that
he have this Bill referred to the Committee
on Agriculture.
This is a very
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
short Bill, containing one clause. I am inclined to think that if the right honourable
gentleman would explain the very slight
change to be effected, the Bill might be given
third reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is correct. I explained the
Bill yesterday. It provides for the honest
labelling of canned goods intended for export.
Heretofore the checking bas had to be done
at the retail stage, and of course this was
possible only when the goods were retailed
in the domestic market.
I have been impressed, just as has the
honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), with the fact that, especially this
session, nearly all bills have been referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. In times of greater prosperity the
Railway Committee was also very busy.
When this Bill came to us I thought it
might be referred to the Committee on Agriculture, but really it has to do with trade
and commerce, and to my mind there is no
reason why the Bill should not go to the
committee dealing with such matters. Notwithstanding the remarks of the honourable
senator opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), I
am inclined to think we should refer it to
a standing committee to sec if it cannot
possibly be improved. There are two or
three honourable members who take a very
keen interest in the subject-matter.

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Public Health and Inspection of
Foods.

The Bill might

CON SIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion af Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Commnittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Bill
contains only six clauses; but there are many,
changes. It is a Bill ta which very littie
could be done by a special committee.
Section 1 was agreed ta.
On section 2-tes:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This clause

United Kingdom, the present duties on tea

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Befare we pass
this clause would the right honaurable gentleman explain generally what bas actuated the
Government in making the variaus changes in
schedule A? They are mainly technical. I
confess that 1 can throw no light on the
value of the policy of altering that schedule,
but there may be a guiding principle behind
the proposed changes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I have studied
the debate which. took place in the House of
Commons, and I must say that I do not
see any principle at ail inherent in the amendments. There is no change of policy, but
merely a correction or readjustment of duty,
and, according ta my information, it is mainly
downward.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Are the changes
consequential on the Ottawa agreements?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They would
seem ta be, because the number of items that
are "free" under the British preferential tariff
is very great; in fact, the word "free" is ahl
but universal throughout the schedule. I
think the multiplied presence of that word
would reoommend this me-asure ta the most
extreme free-trader in the House.

CANADIAN
COMMONS

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
AMENDMENTS REFERRED
COMMITTEE

TO

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
members, a message has been received from
the House of Commons returning Bill F, an
Act to amend the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act, 1932, with several
amendments to which they desire the concurrence of the Senate. When shall these amendments be taken into consideration?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I understand that the main amendment, and practically the only one of any
consequence, lias to do with the provisions respecting Lloyd's. I may say, subject to makng a correction when I read the exact amendment, that it repeals all the Lloyd's provisions
nserted by this House in its initial treatment
of the measure. These provisions permitted
any member of Lloyd's to enter Canada withnut making the usual deposit, because of the
securities taken under the authority of the
British Parliament, and applicable to the
entire area of Lloyd's policyholders. They
also had to do with certain conditions and
stipulations to be agreed to by Lloyd's in
respect of service upon them here and the
payment of obligations due under policies.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

If the amendment stopped there it would
mean that Lloyd's, notwithstanding what
they
have done in England, would have to comply
with the usual practice of making a deposit
here. But it is my understanding that the
amendment further provides ·that the whole
Bill shall have no application to any member
of Lloyd's that lias obtained a provincial
licence, in so far as it may operate under that
licence. That is to say. Lloyd's are left to
provincial jurisdiction. If the provisions inserted by this House with respect to this
very contentious subject are not to become
law-and I have no hesitation in saying they
were the best and most equitable provisions
all round, although there were very great
difficulties thrown in the way-it seems to me
this alternative is a wise one. It virtually
notifies all concerned that this Dominion is
not going to enter into any litigation in order
to shut out those who we know can conduct
insurance, or in order to establish our jurisdiction in this respect as against a licensce of
a province. I believe no concern can enter a
just complaint against Lloyd's being left to
the provinces, save that it would be better if
some plan could be found under which Llovd's
would be supervised federally, as other great
insurance organizations are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I rise simply to
make a mild objection to the statement
of my right honourable friend that the
legislation we passed covering the operations
of Lloyd's in Canada was better than what
is now submitted to us. I disagree with my
right honourable friend, because I think that
from the standpoint of pure logic the amendment now before us would improve the Bill,
as it would put Lloyd's on an equal footing
with other companies. At least it recognizes
the right of Lloyd's to operate under a
provincial charter. From the standpoint of tactics
and opportunism, the position taken by my
right honourable friend could perhaps be
defended, but on the basis of equal treatment
for all companies the amendment is a good
one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
No object
can be served by carrying the argument
further. But there is a glaring lack of
logic
in saying that in respect of one organization
we recognize the authority of the province to
hicense, but with respect to all others we
make no such recognition.
I should like
especially to hear the views of the protagonists
of this amendment in support of its alleged
logic. However, we have to take facts as
they are, and I think the amendment
suggests the second best method of procedure
10 the present instance. It should be borne

was followed in other provinces. The legislation was contested and we-nt to the Privy
Council. There it was uph-eld, but a reservation was made that as the jurisdiction in
bankruptcy and insolvency was faderai, the
province would have no jurisdiction when a

the Dominion.

A farmecr who under Bill 92 had bis liabilities reducod to the value of hjs assets would

It is difficuit to anticipate how important
these measures may become, from the standpoint of national obligations. It is obvions
to everyone that tbcy wi]l not add to tbe
gencral aggregate of debt, for the effeet of
their operation will undoubted]y be to snbtract from tbat genoral aggregate. Tbey may,
and I do not doubt that thcy will, add to the

the subtraction will neressarily be mucb greater
than the addition,' becanse of the compounding provision and tbe compromising of liabilitics. Tberefore tbe burden of debt uipon tbe
nation and the people, botb being considcred
as a wbole, will be diminisbed.
I do not doubt, that the proposed legislation

borrow money and then, if the load became

too heavy, seek statutory relief. We had
the healthy state of things in my provinceand I am sure it was the same in ahl the
eastern provinces-that our farmers kept constantly in mind their obligation to incur
no more debts than they could reasonably
expect to repay. Since the Bankruptcy Act
came into force there has been a tendency
to laxity in this regard. I recaîl that an
effort was made to exelude the farmers of
the province of Quebec from its purview. I
should be interested to know the number of
farmers in -the West who have taken advantage of the Bankruptcy Act. I hope their
number is fewer than I am led to believe.
This legisiation may to a certain extent
invade the jurisdietion of the provinces, but
I think it will be welcomed by the whole
farming community, and I am disposed to
support it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
was read the second time.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl this

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At the next sitting. We generally rely upon the committee
to Tecommend what documents shahl be

worth the expense of printing. I ask that this

PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. RO&BINSON, Chairman of the
Special Committee on the Publie Accounts
and Estimatp.s of Canada, presented the third
report of the committee.
Hon. Mr. MUiRDOCK: Will this report be
printed for review before the next sitting?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That, il
presumne, would be a matter for the Printing
Cornmittee. I notice the report is very brief.
It merely submits the evidence taken and
recommerids that the wo.rk be continued by
a special committee next session. Consequently ail that could be printed would be
the evidence. It would seem to me rather
unwise to peint the evidence in its present
truncated form. If we follow the recommendation c.ntained in the report, and reappoint the committee next session, more evidence will be taken, and it would seeffi better
to have it ail together. I do not know what
is contemplated by the Chairman or the cornmittee in this respect.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If the report of the
,evidence is flot to be printed, I hope that
to-morrow the Chaîrman or some member of
the committee will give us a stateiment of the
high lights developed in the meetings already
held. Several honourable senators are in-'
terested in this inquiry, and I think we ought
to be informed briefly what, if anything, has
been discovered by the committee.
Hon. Mr. Ma.cARTHUR: Honourable members, this committee, which was suggested by
the honourable member from. Moncton (Hon.
Mr. Robinson), bas ignored ail the members
of the Finance Committee except one. For
nine years I have been a member of the

Hon. Mr. MacARTRUR: Now the mountain has laboured and hrought forth a mouse.
I think a oommittee could -have been selected
which would have functioned to better purpose and brought forth something more tangible than this special committee has produced. The Finance Committee, of which
the honourable member from Inkerman (Hon.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BELAND moved the third reading of Bill 70, an Act to amend the Food
and Drugs Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I move that this Bill be not now
read a third time, but be amended by striking
out the words "or company," on page 1,
line 16.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Will the right honourable gentleman state his reasons for suggesting that these words be eliminated?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Clause 2 of
the Bill provides:
The said Act is further amended by adding
thereto the following section immediately after
section six thereof:
6a. No person or company shall import, offer
for sale, or sell any remedy represented by
label or by advertisement to the general publie
as a treatment for any of the diseases, disorders
or abnormal physical states named or included
in Schedule A to this Act or in any amendment to such Schedule.
According to the Interpretation Act, "person"
includes a company, partnership, and so
forth. If the words "no person or company"
are used together, as they now appear in this
clause, the definition of "person" will be
limited in its application, because the
presence of the words "or company" would
seem to indicate the intention of Parliament
to refer only to a human being or a company. But if the words "or company" are
left out, the meaning of "person" will be
broader and will include company, partnership and the other things mentioned in the
Interpretation Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
from this explanation that the use of the
expression "no person or company" might
result in excluding partnerships from the
prohibition intended by this clause.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR.

I agree with

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. LITTLE, with the leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I have received a communication
with respect to this measure, to the effect
that it is destructive of powers given by Act
of Parliament last session to a company for
the construction of a tunnel at Sarnia. Persons who protest against the Bill insist on
being heard before a committee of this
House. I have no objection to the second
reading, on the understanding that there will
be a reference to a committee, and that
this committee will not pass upon the measure
without giving an opportunity for a hearing
to those who have requested it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
INTERNATIONAL JOINT

COMMISSION

IN QUIRY

Hon. Mr. RILEY inquired of the Government:
1. Is the International Joint Commission still
in existence?
2. If so, where can one procure a copy of its
annual report?

3. Who are the present Canadian commissioners?
4. What emoluments do they receive: (a) as
salary-each; (b) travelling expenses-each;
(c) for subsistence allowance-each?
5. Where do they hold their meetings, and
about how many a year?
6. Are there any entertaining allowances?
7. If so, how much?

JUNE 26, 1934
8. If there are no yearly reports since the
late T. Chase Casgrain has resigned as
president, is it the intention to have an annual
report to present to Parliament, giving some
information as asked above?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, this subject is of considerable
importance. The answer to the honourable
gentleman's inquiry is as follows:
1. Yes.
2. The Commission issues reports on specific
cases, not annual reports. The latest report
on the Rainy Lake and Upper Boundary
Waters reference was presented to the two
Governments last week. Copies of this report
will, in due course, be available at the office
of the secretary of the Canadian section of
the Commission.
3. Charles A. Magrath, Chairman; Sir
William Hearst; George W. Kyte.
4. (a) $7,500 annually, less 10 per cent.
(b) Actual travelling expenses.
(c) No subsistence allowance.
5. Under the rules adopted at the inception
of the Commission, and which were submitted
to the two Governments before being put into
operation, provision was made for two fixed
meetings, one in April in Washington and
the other in October in Ottawa. Other meetings are arranged as the occasion requires.
When cases come before the Commission for
settlement or investigation public hearings are
held on either side of the boundary at places
that will best serve the convenience of al]
the interested parties in both countries. Many
of the matters coming before the Commission,
and particularly the larger investigations
under article 9 of the Treaty of 1909 establishing the Commission, such as those relating
to the St. Lawrence Deep Waterway, the
pollution of boundary waters and the Trail
Smelter, have involved very extensive technical inquiries and conferences between the
Commission and technical experts representing the two Governments and other interests.
The work of the Commission itself is carried
on to a large extent by correspondence between the Ottawa and Washington offices, but
executive meetings of the whole Commission
are held from time to time either at the
Commission's offices in Ottawa or Washington
or at other places as may be found convenient.
6. No.
7. Answered by 6.
8. No yearly reports by the Commission
have ever been issued. It is true that after
the Commission was organized, at the end
of its first year, the Canadian secretary submitted a report to the Canadian Commissioners largely for the purpose of having on
record the rules of procedure as applied in

577

actual practice to the first cases coming before the Commission. This was not, it will be
observed, a report from either the Commission
as a whole or from the Canadian section of
the Commission to the Canadian Government. It has never been the practice on
either side to make annual reports from the
Commission to the respective Governments.
Each question coming before the Commission,
when finally disposed of, is communicated to
the two Governments either in the form of
an order, in cases where the Commission has
final jurisdiction, or in the form of a report
making recommendations to the two Governments. The question of each section making
an annual report to its Government was considered in the early years of the Commission,
when Mr. Casgrain was Canadian Chairman,
and it was concluded that such a practice
would be inconsistent with one of the basic
principles governing the work of the Commission, which was that the two sections, Canadian and United States, should under no circumstances function separately, but should act
as one complete tribunal.
THE SENATE AND MONEY BILLS
DISCUSSION

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable members, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I wish to call the attention of the
House to a matter which probably has been
overlooked. Last Thursday, on the motion
for second reading of Appropriation Bill No.
4, the honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) stated:
I arn of course aware of the limitation of
this Chamber with respect to an increase in
the vote-something whieh I do not suppose
anyone would rise to ask-and I know we cannot decrease it except by rejecting the whole
Bill.
In 1918 a special committee, appointed the
previous year, reported that the Senate had
the power to amend money bills. The chairman of that committee was Hon. Mr. Ross,
an eminent jurist and subsequently leader
of one of the parties in this Chamber. The
report is short, and I should like to read it
into Hansard. The committee had the advice
of Mr. E. Lafleur, Mr. Aimé Geoffrion, and
Mr. John 6. Ewart, and the report was in
accordance with their opinions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
my honourable friend ask that the document
be printed in Hansard to refresh the memories
of honourable senators who were in the
House when the report was adopted, and for
the benefit of new members.

I must admit that I stand corrected as to
the power of the Senate to amend money
bills. I was net clear that we had decided
supply bills could be amended. I have a

vague recollection that the report to which
my honourable friend refers would cover our
right to reduce a particular vote in a supply
bill, although since 1867 the tradition bas
been that the Bill should be accepted or rejected in toto. The report, in contradiction
of the tradition, affirms that we can amend

a supply bill by reducing any item in it.

hands of the House. I should like to place
on record the report, and as well the opinions

part of the Constitution of the Dominion of

Memorandum
Re Riglts of the Senate in Matters of
Financial Legislation
The Constitution and Powers anti Practice of
the flouse of Lords and the House of Commons
are so well known that it is uinnecessary to
refer to them except so far as it is required
to explain the constitution and fiisnctioss of tie
Canadian Senate. This enquiry will be limited
to the pouwers of the Senate in respect of
"Money Bills" Bills appropriating any part of
the revenue or imposing a tax.
The House of Lords bas at present six

create an unliiited sunuber of new peerages.
This is comimionly known as the "wamping
power" and lias often been described as the
safety valve of the British Constitution. From
recent legislation it is quite clear that the
House of Commons supported by the Crown
can impose any ternis on the House of Lords.
Till then that flouse hiad constitutionally
co-ordinate powers with the House of Couinons
in "Money Bills" as in all Bills and had never
fornally abandoned thenu except as to originating money Bills. Todd, Vol. 1. p. 813. says.Lord Derby in 1861 clearly showed that the
Lords hiad never formally abandoned its rights
to aend "Money Bills" and that in the

opinion

of emisinent constitutional

authorities

they would be warranted in such an art shotild
it be necessary to vindicate their freedom of
deliberation and to prevent the enacting of a

measure which they regarded as objectionable.
In 1661 the Counnions asserted "that no Bill
ought to begin in the Lords Ilouse which lays
any charge or tax upon any of the Commons."
In 1671 the Comnmons affirmed that "in al]
aids given to the King by the Comuons the
rate or tax ougit not to be altered by the
Lords."

JUNE 26, 1934
In 1678 the Commons resolved: "That all aids
and supplies and aids to His Majesty in Parliament are the sole gift of the Commons and
that all Bills for the granting of any such aids
and supplies ought to begin with the Commons
and that it is the undoubted and sole right of
the Commons to direct, limit and appoint in
such Bills the ends, purposes, considerations,
conditions, limitations and qualifications of such
grants which ought not to be changed or altered
by the House of Lords."
The House of Lords protested but this was
the practice thereafter. In 1861 the Commons
asserted the right to include all financial
proposals in the annual Supply Bill, and thus,
not having the power to amend, the Lords
would have to pass the Bill or reject it as a
whole. This was protested against by the
Lords but was thereafter the practice. The
power of the House of Lords over finance was
practically gone from that day. This was the
state of the practice concerning finance between
the two Imperial Houses when the British
North America Act was passed in 1867.
It will be noticed that these powers of the
Commons and these disabilities of the Lords
are not settled by a law but by practice and
custom founded on Resolutions of the Commons
backed up by threats to which the Lords
yielded under protest. Mr. Asquith's Resolution (1910) "That it is expedient that the
House of Lords be disabled by law from
rejecting or amending a Money Bill, etc." is an
admission of this fact.
Does the practice of the Imperial Parliament as settled in 1867 or as it was asserted
to be before the Act just passed limiting the
powers of the House ef Lords govern the
relations of the Senate and Hous' of Commons
on "Money Bills"?
Formerly there were many kinds of Colonial
constitutions granted by the Crown, but they
nearly all ultimately took the form of a constitution consisting of the Crown, a Council
appointed by the Crown and an Elective
Assembly. The grant was until a comparatively
late date by Letters Patent except in the case
of Canada (1791), which was granted by Parliament as it contained provisions that the
Crown could not grant by Letters Patent(See Appendix I in Lord Grey's "The Colonial
Government of Lord Russell"). They were all
miniatures of the British Constitution.
There is no reasonable doubt that Legislative
Councils which are miniatures of the House of
Lords are constitutionally bound under penalty
of being "swamped" to follow the practice of
the House of Lords with regard to money Bills
as of the date when the Provincial Constitution was granted.
Whether such Councils
would be bound to change their practice as the
practice of the House of Lords changed has
se far as we know never been agitated.
The Constitution of 1791 for the Provinces
of Upper and Lower Canada provided for a
Legislative Council of a named number for each
province, reserving te the Crown the right to
nane as many more as it saw fit. There was
also provision for the creation of hereditary
Councillors. Nothing was said about the relation of the Houses or money Bills. It is
probable that Parliament assumed that the
Council would follow the English Parliamentary
practice and if it d'id not it could be
"saamped." The Couneil was an almost perfect
miniature of the House of Lords.
7472"S71

579

The Constitution of 1840, when these two
provinces were united, was in the main the
sanie. The Legisiative Council was to consist
of a certain number (20) and power was
reserved to add as many more as the Crown
saw fit. The provision in the Constitution of
1791 respecting hereditary Councillors was
dropped. The Constitution of 1791 gave representative government.
That of 1840 made
responsible government possible. Section 57
provided that money Bills should originate in
the Assembly but it was also provided that
the Assembly should not originate a Bill unless
recommended by the Governor.
There are several constitutions in the
Southern Hemisphere of practically the saine
structure. The Colonial Office said that those
Councils should follow the practice of the House
of Lords and not amend money Bills but
might reject tliem. The Privy Council also
decided against the Legislative Council of
Queensland (which was a nominated Council
with the "swamping" power) in its claim to
amend money Bills.
In New South Wales the Council was to
consist of at least twenty-one members but
there was no legal limit to the total number.
Marriot, Second Chambers, p. 156, says: "There
have been various disputes, chiefly on fiscal
questions, between the two Chambers and
Parkes definitely asked for a recognition of
the principle that Ministers might recommend
to the Governor the creation of Councillors."
The Crown for the time refused, but in 1889
Parkes was more successful in obtaining from
Lord Carrington permission to add members
to the Legislative Chamber at the convenience
and discretion of the Executive. That principle,
closely akin to one which has long prevailed
in the Mother Country, may now be regarded
as securely enshrined among the constitutional
conventions of the Colony." At p. 163 lie
quotes from Wise's Commonwealth of Australia,
who, it seems, regarded a Government of two
Chambers with an Upper House nominated by
the Governor as the more workable one, as
follows: "This plan gave the Second Chamber
something of the influence and attributes of
the House of Lords. It was constrained by its
own traditions to yield before any manifestations of the popular will and could at any time
be coerced by the appointment of new members." Todd (Parliamentary Government in the
Colonies, p. 821) gives the particulare of a case
of "swamping" in New Zealand.
See also Keith, Responsible Government in
Dominions, p. 569.
It is quite clear that an Upper House in a
Colony where the Executive has this "swamping
power" is quite as helpless as the House of
Lords in financial and in any measures that
the Government of the day is determined to
carry.
Besides these Councils could be
summarily dismissed by the Crown. They had
no property in their position, merely naked
trusts (Despatch of Duke of Newcastle to
Governor of Prince Edward Island, February
4th. 1862).
There are Constitutions where the Legislative
Council is elective and necessarily the number
fixed and no swamping can take place. In
Tasmania the Council is elective. The number
is eighteen. It has persistently claimed and
exercised the right to amend money Bills.
Keith
(Responsible
Government
in
the
Dominions), p. 626, says, "that it is useless to

SENATE

contend that the practice of the flouse of
Lords should govern in such a case." He also
on the last page of Vol. 1 of his works refers
to the action of the Legislative Council of
Quebec in throwing out a Supply Bill. He
mentions the fact that it was a nominated
House without the swamping power and seems
by his mention of this to receognize that such
a Council is different from those where such
power exists.
The next matter of importance to note is
that the British Constitution is unitary. The
King and Lords and Commons have a jurisdictien one and undivided. Prior te the creation of
the Dominion of Canada the Colonies within the
scope of their constitutions w ere unitary. The

is quite clear that if the House of

When the Bill is for a smialler sum and the

must be assumed that the Crown bas assented
(Sec Todd, Vol. 2, p. 391.)
to the reduction.
When such a Bill goes to the Senate the
amoiunt mentioned in the Bill is therefore the
sum recommended by the Crown. The Senate
could not increase this sum without coming in
conflict with the prerogative of the Crown to

taxation is the necessity for the publie service

as declared by the Crown through its constitutional advisers. The Senate therefore cannot
directly or indirectly originate one cent of
expenditure of public funds or impose a cent
of taxation on the people. This is involved in
Sections 53 and 54 and the Clauses of the Act
defining the executive power. This is, however,
the only limitation of the powers of the Senate
in regard to "Money Bills" in the British North
America Act. In all other respects the Act
leaves with it co-ordinate powers with the
House of Commons to amend or reject such
Bills.
One objection urged against this statement
is that the Senate is bound to follow the
practice of the House of Lords and not amend
a Money Bill. There is nothing in the British
North America Act which says this. The
preamble says: "With a Constitution similar
in principle to that of the United Kingdom"
and therefore it is said the Senate is bound
by the practices of the House of Lords.
Resolutions, practice and disuse go to form the
The
constitution of the United Kingdom.
Canadian Constitution can only be changed by
the Imperial Parliament, and no resolution or
practice can alter a word of it.
Principles and practices or customs are very
different things. On principle the House of
Lords is co-ordinate with the House of
Commons, and the Senate of Canada is coordinate with the House of Commons, except
in this one matter of originating Money Bills.
The flouse of Commons in England, by its
use of the "swamping power," has reduced the
House of Lords to a state of impotence in all
financial matters. The House of Commons in
Canada bas no such power. A law without a
sanction is nothing. A practice or custom or
convention without the power to enforce it is
nothing even if the practice were applicable.
The Constitution of the Senate as already
outlined is fundamentally different from the
House of Lords and its functions of safeguarding Provincial interests in a federal system is
one unknown to an Upper House in a unitary
system as is the House of Lords. Then the
Senate is in a measure representative although
nominated. This is brought about by the property and residence qualifications of Senators.
The division of the Dominion into Senatorial
Districts differentiates the two Upper Houses.
The Senators first of all represent their Provinces or Districts and their first duty is to
them. Then the "swamping power" was taken
away for the express purpose of making the
Senate independent of the House of Commons
as a condition precedent to Confederation. On
what implication or analogy can a practice
forced on the House of Lords by an all-powerful
House of Commons be applicable to an indeIt would
pendent House like the Senate?
require a Statute to effect this, like Sections
53 and 54.
Again why did the Imperial Parliament when
passing the British North America Act insert
as Section 53 only a part of the Resolution of
1678, knowing that the power of imposing the
practice of the House of Lords by the swamping power was gone? The contention that it
expressed (partof the 1678 Resolution and left the
other part to be implied or settled by a practice
of the House of Lords is not a reasonable one.
The fact is that it was the Resolution of 1661
that was so inserted.
It is evident that the Canadian Senate.
subject to the limitations of Sections 53 and

581

54 of the British North America Act, is an
independent body with co-ordinate powers with
the flouse of Commons and entitled to make its
own Rules and Practice.
The contention that the word "originate" in
Section 53 excludes the change of a word or
figure by the Senate is altogether inconsistent
with the ordinary meaning of the word and
with the whole history of its use in Imperial
Parliamentary Practice and in the Provincial
Constitutions with elected Councils and in
European Constitutions with similar clauses to
53. We have seen that "nominated" Councils
with the swamping power were held to the
practice of the House of Lords, but those with
elected Councils were not, but both had clauses
corresponding with our Sections 53 and 54. It
is a principle that a limitation goes as far as
it says and no further. Section 53 is a limitation of the powers of the Senate and does not
go beyond what it necessarily includes. What
this is bas already been dealt with.
When the House of Commons of Canada
claims that it can drag the Senate beneath it
as the Commons did the House of Lords in,
power,"
through the "swamping
England
the answer is that it bas not got this power
and is as much bound by the British North
America Act as the Senate. We have a Constitution that can only be altered by the
Imperial Parliament. The House of Commons
can not by passing Rules add to its powers
or diminish those of the Senate. Rule 78 of
the House of Commons is quite outside of the
powers of that House.
If the Senate has not the power to amend
Money Bills it has no practical power to see
fair play to the Provinces in finance or to
protect an interest unfairly used financially.
If it threw out a Money Bill under the practice
in England, as of 1860, the Commons could the
next Session tack a new Bill in the same words
to the Supply Bill and say: You can not amend;
paso or reject the whole Bill. To reject a
Supply Bill might in olden times have been
feasible, but to-day with the functions of
Government so vast and complicated it is
unthinkable. ThÀrn would be no pay for the
Army. Navy, Civil Service, Judges, Government Railway men, or money to pay ony public
charge. It would mean chaos. A Supply Bill
should be passed as a matter of course by the
Senate in almost any conceivable circumstances
if it contains nothing but Supply. If other
matters are inserted in the Bill or "tacked to
it" these should be struck out and be made
into a separace Bill or Bils.

Senates and Upper Chambers. p. 15.) For the
composition of Upper Chambers in the Colonies,
ses Temperley, p. 48. For the swamping of the
Upper Chamber in the Colonies, see Temperley,
p. 269, App. 6.
"The Federal state is the most complex and
ingenious of modern political communities and
its Upper Chamber usually exhibits one aspect
of that ingenuity. One principle is, however,
common in all such formations. The federation
is based on a union of individuals, and of
states, and that union is expressed in the
constitution of the two Chambers. The lower
one represents the rights and powers of the
people-the total numerical majority. The
Upper Chamber represents the rights and
powers of the states in their separate and
individual capacity. Population bas always full
representation in the Lower Chamber."
"In the unitary state the Upper Chamber
only represents the rights of property or individuals or of the classes. In this respect then
a Federal Senate always bas an advantage
which no Upper Chamber in a unitary state
(as for example the House of Lords in
England) can ever claim to possess, and it is
this fact which lessens the possibilities of

p. 209.)
At page 224 Temperley says, "In theory the
Senate of Canada possesses equal rights with
those of the Lower House except that it can
not originate money bills. It has, however,
the full power either to amend or reject them."
Speaking of the A.ustralian Senate, Marriott
at page 168 says: "But like the American
Senate, it accords to each state equal representation-a principle not asserted without
strong and intelligible protests from the larger
States. To the smaller States on the other
hand, this principle was the condition precedent, the 'sheet anchor' of their rights and
liberties. And, once asserted, it is fundamental
conditions)
(except in unimaginable
and
unalterable."
In a Return to an Address relating to the
Constitution of Second Chambers, of the Bonourable the House of Commons (Imperial),
dated March 3, 1910, page 3, paragraph 2, the
following appears:"2. It is provided by section 53 of the British
North America Act that 'Bills for appropriating any part of the public revenue, or for
imposing any tax or impost, shall originate in
the House of Commons.' There is no other
provision limiting the power of the Senate with
regard either to finance or to general legislation."
The South Australian Constitution contains
a clause corresponding with our section 53 and
Keith says of this at page 626 of volume 2:
"In financial matters, as the Constitution had
carefully left the matter totally undetermined
beyond providing for the origination of such
Bills in the Lower House, it was only found
possible to work at all by an informal agreement between the two Houses."
Keith in volume 1, page 567, says:
"In 1909 and 1910 minor questions had
arisen in the case of New Zealand as to the
position of the Council. In the former year
the Council inserted an appropriation clause
in a Reformatories Bill, which was validated
ex post facto by a Governor's message being

583

obtained to cover it, and the Speaker decided
that that procedure was adequate for the
occasion. In 1910 the Upper House altered
the Crimes Amendment Bill by inserting an
appropriation clause, and there was rather a
warm discussion, the Speaker ruling that
either a Governor's message must be obtained
and the Bouse formally by resolve decide not
to insist on its privileges, or the Bill must be
laid aside. The former course was adopted
after a lively debate."
Montreal, April 30, 1918.
The Honourable W. B. Ross,
The Senate, Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir,-We have been asked if in our
opinion the Senate has the power to amend
Money Bills.
Sections 17 and 91 of the British North
America Act place the Senate on exactly the
same footing as the House of Commons as
respects all legislation.
The only material derogation to this general
rule is contained in section 53 which provides
that Bills for appropriating any part of the
public revenue or for imposing any tax or
impost shall originate in the House of
Commons.
The denial of the right to originate Money
Bills does not involve the denial of the right
to amend them. Nothing therefore in the text
of the British North America Act takes away
the latter right from the Senate.
The first paragraph of the preamble where
it is stated that the provinces desire to be
united federally with a constitution similar in
principle to that of the United Kingdom is
relied on.
These words being in the preamble have much
less importance than if they were in the text.
Further it is obvious that similarity in prineiple does not mean identity in detail; the
Canadian constitution differs from the British
constitution in many and important respects;
the similarity in principle referred to in the
preamble is intended to exist only to the extent
stated in the text.
The third paragraph of the preamble states
that it is expedient not only that the constitution of the Legislative authority in the
Dominion be provided for but also that the
nature of the Executive Government therein
be declared, and the text of the Act contains
many sections which merely restate rules of the
British constitution such as section 53 already
referred to.
If the above-mentioned words of the preamble
meant that the British constitution applies to
Canada except in so far as the text of the Act
expressly derogates therefrom the third paragraph of the preamble and all thoee sections,
partieularly section 53, would be useless or
meaningless.
The consideration of how the rule limiting
the powers of the House of Lords in the
United Kingdom came to be adopted affords
an additional argument in support of the view
suggested by the text of the British North
America Act.
In the early days there was a conflict
between the British Bouse of Commons and
the House of Lords on this question of the
powers of the House of Lords in respect of
Money Bills.

584

SENATE

In 1678 the Commons resolved:
"That all aids and supplies and aids to Ris
Majesty in Parliament are the sole gift of the
Commons and that all Bills for the granting
of any such aids and supplies ought to begin
with the Commons and that it is the undoubted
and sole right of the Commons to direct, limit
and appoint in such Bills the ends, purposes.
considerations,
conditions,
limitations
and
qualifications of such grants which ought not
to be changed or altered by the House of
Lords."
In 1693 the Lords resolved:
"That the naking of aumendnents and abatements of rates of Bills of Supply sent up froi
the House of Commons is a fundamental, inherent
and undoubted right of the House of Peers from
which their Lordships can never depart."
It is true that the Lords did not act in
accordance with this resolution and tacitly submitted to the claim of the Commons, obviously
to avoid conflict with the latter flouse, but
this practice was not the law. and this appears
from the preamble of the House of Commons
resolution of 1910 which announced the proposed legislation curtailing the powers of the
Lords.
(Msy's Parliamentary Practice, 12th
edition, p. 518.)
It is remîarkable that of the two restrictions
on the rigits of the Lords which the Commons
by its resolution of 1678 tried to impose,
namely: the denial of the riglt to originate
and the denial of the riglht to aend Money
Bills. the British North Amuerica Act while
mentioning the first in section 53 should not
mention the second against which the Lords
had specially protested.
If it had been the intention of the British
Parliamenît to impose the two restrictions on
the Senate it surely would have mentioned
them both or if content to rely on the preamble
as inrorporating the whole British constitution,
it would have mentioned neither.
To those reasons iniglt lie added this furtier
consideration that there is very little analogy
between the Lords and the Senate. The Lords
represent themselves, the Senate represents the
Provinces. The Lords are net in an independent
position as the flouse of Couinions can use its
influence over the Crown and induce it to add
as many members as are needed to the House
of Lords to obtain a favourable majority.
It is probably for that reason that section
18 of the British North America Act when
dealing w-ith the privileges. immsuonities and
powers of the Senate refers as the maximum
for such privileges, immunities and powers to
those held, enjoyed and exercised by the
Imperial House of Commons (and not by the
House of Lords) at the passing of the Act.
Under the circumstances. we are of the
opinion that the Senate of Canada may amend
a Money Bill originating in the House of
Connons as fully as the House of Commons can
do.
Of course the powers of the Senate are
liinited to the same extent as those of the
House of Commons by the fact that Money
Bills must be recommended by a message of the
Governor General.
Yours truly,
(Sgd.)
Hon.

Mr. HUGHES.

Aimé Geoffrion.

400 Wilbrod Street,
Ottawa, 27th April, 1918.
The Hon. Senator W. B. Ross,
The Senate, Ottawa.
Dear Sir,-In reply to yours of the 23rd
instant, I beg to say that I have read with
muci interest the "Memsorandum re rights of
the Senate in matters of financial legislation,"
and I find in it a great deal that, were the
matter now being discussed for the first time,
might well be urged in support of what is
evidently the writer's view.
In considering all subjects of the class to
which the present belongs. regard lias alvaysand very rightly-been paid to history and
and the relations between our
precedents:
Senate and House of Commons are, as I think,
so firmily established that no change could be
introduced save by constitutional amendnent.
L do siot muean, necessarily, by aniendment of
the British North America Act-amendment of
constitutional practice, agreed upon by both
Houses, would suffice.
Froin the very earliest time, the Colonial
Assemblies have successfully contended for the
sause privilege with reference to financial bills
as tiat enjoyed by the British House of
Comnions. 'Tie cases in whichl contention arose
are very nuserous, but I do not know of any
in which the quarrel between the two Houses
has resulted in substantial victory for the
Council-as. in the earlier constitutions, the
second chamber was styled.
A glaice at the histories furnishes use with
two instances whIich miay be taken as containing
typical assertion of the privilege of the
The first of these is noted in
Asseiblies.
Dickerson's
Aierican
Colonial Governmsent,
1696-1765: The author says (p. 160) that, in
the timse of Governor Cornbury of -New York:
"The Council sought to amend the revenue
bill so as to resmove this objection, but it was
met by the point blank assertion that the
Assesmbly would permit no amendiment of Money
Bills."
The second instance I take from Dr. Kingsford's book. the History of Canada. volume 9,
p. 217.
On that occasion (1818) the Council
and Assemîbly were brouglht into sharp conflict,
with the result. as the author says, that:"The Council did not conceive an amendment
to the money bill as a breach of privilege: but
as it was so asserted, the Council would hereafter forbear from all anendment, and simply
reject any bill submitted to it, should occasion
suggest."
There can be no doubt that the differences
between the British House of Lords and the
Canadian Senate referred to in the Memorandum are of substantial character; but, after
all, tihe two Houses, with reference to the

JUNE 26, 1934
FINANCE ACT REPEAL BILL
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 111, an Act to repeal
the Finance Act.
He said: The Bill merely repeals the
Finance Act, 1927, which authorizes advances
to be made to the banks on the security of
certain bonds defined in that Act. Necessarily this provision will be inoperative on the
assumed taking effect of the Central Bank
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend might deal also with the second bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The same explanation, in principle, applies to Bill 112,
repealing the Act of 1915, which permits supplementary issue of Dominion notes for special
purposes during the grain season. This issue
will be a function of the Central Bank. Therefore the old Act falls into desuetude and will
be repealed when the Central Bank functions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These bills are
consequential on the passing of the Bank of
Canada Bill. I would suggest the third reading be deferred until that bill is before us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course, if
the Central Bank Bill does not pass, these
bills will never be called into effect. But
the honourable gentleman's suggestion is quite
satisfactory.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
DOMINION NOTES REPEAL BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 112, an Act to repeal
Chapter Four of the Statutes of 1915.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is this similar to
the other bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This deals
with the repeal of the statute of 1915 for the
supplementary issue of Dominion notes.
Naturally it will not become effective until
the coming into force of the Central Bank
Bill, to which my honourable friend looks
forward with such pleasure.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

CANADIAN SEALING AND FISHERY
INTERESTS IN PACIFIC WATERS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. H. H. HORSEY moved concurrence in
the report of the Special Committee with regard to the Administration of Canadian Sealing and Fishery Interests in Pacific Waters.
He said: Honourable members, the Special
Committee on Sealing and Fisheries in Pacifie
The proWaters held several meetings.
ceedings have been printed. The report,
based upon the evidence, has also been
printed and, I believe, distributed. Without
further comment at the moment, I move the
adoption of the report.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would suggest that its adoption wait until to-morrow.
I have not yet had an opportunity of studying the report as fully as I should like.
The motion stands.
SHIPPING BILL
CONCURRENCE

IN COMMONS

AMENDMENTS

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved concurrence in the amendments made by the
House of Commons to Bill E, an Act with
respect to Shipping.
The motion was agreed to.
MESSAGE TO HOUSE OF COMMONS DEFERRED

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved that
a message be sent to the House of Commons
to inform that House that the Senate had
concurred in the amendments to the Act with
respect to Shipping.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to draw
the attention of honourable members to this
situation. This Bill emanated from the Senate
and was transmitted to the House of Commons in English and in French. The House
of Commons has returned the English version
with some amendments, but it has omitted
to send us the French version. At first I
thought it was withheld for the translation of
the amendments, but I am now informed
officially that it is being retained for correction. If the corrections are merely clerical,
they can be made when the Bill is returned
here; but if they are material they mean a
new bill. I cannot understand why the Commons should retain the French version for
correction. Do the contemplated corrections
materially affect the Bill itself? The custodian of the two parchments is the Clerk of
Parliaments, and it is important that the Bill
should be returned to this House as amended

586

SENATE

by the Commons. It will be for our own
translators to see if any corrections are necessary in the French original. The text is always
very carefully examined before bills as enacted
go to the printer.
I draw the attention of honourable members
to a number of statutes to amend clerical
errors in legislation. I might name chapter 13
of 1911, an Act to correct certain clerical
errors in the French version of the Inland
Revenue Act; chapter 24 of 1912, an Act to
correct certain clerical errors in the French
version of the Revised Statutes of 1906;
chapter 14 of 1915, an Act to amend the Dominion Elections Act, section 4; chapter 32
af 1918, an Act to correct a clerical error in
:he French version of the Naturalization Act,
[914; chapter 24 of 1'920, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code (French version) ; chapter Il of
1930, an Act to amend the Criminal Code, section 4. These amending statutes indicate that
when the French and English versions of bills
go to the other House they cannot be amended
outside the purview of Parliament and sent
back to us at leisure. It is a question of procedure. The Clerk of the Coimmons should
transmit to us each bill in the two languages,
more especially when it emanates from this
Chamber.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have information that the French version of the Bill
contains important errors, and consequently
there will be some delay in getting it completed. I cannot say whether the errors are
such as to alter the intention of the Bill.
One is somewhat in a quandary in a matter
of this kind. Our minds are almost entirely
fixed on the English version, and therefore
the French version is really a translation; but
once the translators have donc their work the
French version becomes an original bill. It
is better, even if it involves a little delay,
to have the French version reasonably correct
than to leave the matter to the kindness of
Providence or to statutory amendments.
As our real consideration of this measure
is over except for the formal transmission of
a message to the other House, I suggest that
the motion stand, in the hope that we may
get a French version satisfactory to the officers
of this House, and thereby avoid any complications.
The whole thing does seem to me to illustrate the wisdom of the Bureau for Translations Bill passed this session. I cannot stand
between two French scholars and say which
text is right and which is wrong, but from
an examination of my own, necessarily very
imperfect, I have some reason to feel the
errors in the French original justify the delay.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When a bill
from the Senate is sent to the House of
Commons, can officials there make substantial amendments in it without the sanction et
that House? I agree with my right honourable friend that this message should not be
sent to the other House until we have the
French version before us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The motion will stand.

Ail

right.

The motion stands.
MORNING

S'ITTING

MOTION

Right Hon. Mr. MEIG,HEN: Honourable
members, I beg to move that when the
House adjourns to-day it stand adjourned
until to-morrow at 12 o'clock noon. I know
that notice will be necessary unless the
motion receives unanimous consent. I think
the committees that are to sit to-morrow
morning will be able to discharge their work
before the Senate assembles, and the carly
meeting of the House will expedite business
and advance it another stage before Wednesday night.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Before
we
adjourn I should like to draw attention to
the fact that the Central Bank Bill, one of
the most important, is still to come to us.
We have been expecting it from day to day.
I notice in the report of the Commons
debates the suggestion that the third reading
of that Bill be postponed until this evening
on the understanding that it will require but
one hour's discussion. I hope that is all
that will be necessary; but when there is
talk of prorogation by the end of the week,
I think the House of Commons, in discussing
procedure, should consider the Senate somewhat, and endeavour to co-operate with it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have been
given an undertaking, upon which I think I
can rely, that the Central Bank Bill will be
disposed of by the other House to-day.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Is there any
special reason for meeting at twelve o'clock
to-morrow?
Eleven o'clock might be a
better hour.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The purpose
of the forenoon sitting is to advance all legislation a stage. If we meet at eleven o'clock
we put it beyond the power of the Banking

CANADIAN FARM LOAN B.ILL
THIRD~j

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading et Bibl 93, an Act te amend
the Canadian Ferm Loan Act.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: There is one feature
ef this Bill I should like te point eut te the
members et this honourable House. I brought
it up when the Bill was in committee. Since
then I have had an oppertunity te look inte
it e little more closely, and I think it worthy
of consideration. It is in regard te Part Il
et the Bill, subsection 4 et section 9, deelinýg
with the rate et interest that may be charged
on second mortgage loans which the Farm
Loan Board is being empowered te mrake te
fermers.
Under the present Act the rate et interest
charged by the Board on ferm mortgeges
is 6j per cent. The cost of the money te
the Board is 5 per cent, administration costs
account for one per cent, and one-haîf of
one per cent is added as a reserve for los-&;
that may be incurred on the loans. It was
expleined te the committee tha.t the reserve
thus created had been ample te take cere et
ail bosses incurred te date.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Mey I ask the
honourable gentleman what is his autherity
for that stetement?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: What statement?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The statement
that the reserve created is ample te meet al
possible bosses.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The Chairman et the
Ferm Loan Board stated that the reserve
creeted had been sumfcient te meet the bosses
incurred te date.
The primary and main purpese et the Farm
Lean Act is te open up channeis et borrowing
et a reasonable rate for tarmers whe are ab:e

te give good security, and the Act is neces-

587

sary because in recent years a great many of
the ordinary channels of berrewing, through
prîvate loan comipanies and individuals, have
been closed to such farmersi It is true that
the money has cost the Board 5 per cent, but
I think ail honourable members will agree that
at the present time money could be secured
for the use of the Board, by borrowing on
Government-guaranteed bonds, at a lower
rate. I feel sure it could be borrowed at 4ý
per cent, and I should flot be surprised te learn
that even 4 per cent would be high enough.
Certain limitations are placed upon the size
of the loan that may be made by the Board
on the security of a second mortgage. Subsection 2 of section 9 provides:
The aggregate of loans made to any one
borrower under the provisions of this Act
and of the Canadian Farm Loan Act shall
not excced two-thirds of the appraised value
of the land and buildings in respect of wbich
security is taken ...
This appraisaI would be made on the basis
of present-day values. When the Act was
first brought into force the limit for a boan
against first mortgage security was placed at
50 per cent of the value of the land and 20
paer cent of the value ot the insured property
or the buildings--I arn net quite Sure about
thatHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes, 20 per cent.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It would amnunt to
between 40 and 50 per cent of the value of
the farm at that time. I submit te honourable members that boans made to-day, net in
excess of two-thirds of present appraisals on
farms, would be safer than boans made, Say,
five years ago, when the limit wvas 50 per cent
of the value.
The Bill places a further restriction upen
the amount that may be lent on a Second
mortgage. The latter part of subsection 2 of
section 9 reads:
The amount advanced under this sectien
shall net exceed ene-haif the ameunt advanced
on the security ef the first mertgage.
Considering that limitations are placed on
the lending powers of the Board, and that the
primary objeet et the legisiatien is te meet
the needs ef farmers who wish te borrew
against gond security-only these who cen
give gond security are affected-I submait that
in aIl fairness the Beard.should net charge
for second mortgage boans one per cent in
excess et the current rate charged on first
mortgage loans. Subsection 4 of section 9
provides:
The interest rate on loans made under this
section shall net exceed the current rate
charged in respect et first mortgage boans under
this Act by more than one per centunii per
anTllm.

SENATE
I move that all the words after the word
"Act" be struck out, and I would ask the right
honourable leader of the Government to give
consideration to my amendment. I feel that
it is justified by existing circumstances, by the
necessity of giving encouragement to farmers
and by the fact that money can be borrowed
to-day more cheaply than when this legislation was first passed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I think I understand the point raised
by the honourable gentleman, and I remember
his bringing it to the attention of the committee.
The Act provides for the lending of moneys
to farmers by a Board appointed by the Federal Government. The funds so lent are virtualiy federal funds, because the Farm Loan
Board borrows on its debentures, which are
guaranteed by the Government, and the Government buys them. The original legislation
provided for making loans up to 50 per cent
of the value of farm lands and 20 per cent of
the value of buildings, the percentage of the
total valuation being from 40 to 50, as the
honourable member has stated. This Bill provides further facilities. I am not going to
pretend that I have any enthusiasm for the
present law or the Bill, for I am not enthusiastic about a system under which the Federal
Government makes a direct Joan to any person.
I have always thought that it was the duty
of the provinces, if of Government at all, to
make such loans, and that in matters like
these the Government of Canada should deal
only with the provinces. However, the present
Government is committed, as was the former
one. to the principle of this legislation.
The Bill empowers the Board to make a
loan to a farmer on second mortgage security,
over and above an existing loan secured by
a first mortgage. There are the limitations to
which the honourable member refers; nevertheless the security is only a second mortgage
on the farm land and a charge on implements
and chattels. I do not think we can afford
to follow any principles ttat a good business
concern would not follow, though I am afraid
we shall. Certainly no business concern would
lend on the margin of security stipulated in
the Bill, and especially on the quality of that
security-for chattels are included-at as low
a rate of interest as would te charged for
a loan on first mortgage security. The extra
rate of one per cent is little enough.
The honourable gentleman says that Dr.
MacLean, the Farm Loan Commissioner, told
the committee that the charge of one-half of
one per cent over the cost ai the money had
proved sufficient to take care of losses to date.
Hon

Mr. SINCLAIR.

I do not recall the statement, but I will not
for a moment dispute the honourable gentleman's word. That statement really means
nothing. The Act bas been in effect only
since 1920. The losses ta date mean the
written-off losses. Who knows what the
losses are? Those which are going to accrue
under this policy-I do not care what Government is in office-will never te taken care
of by one-half, or much more than one-half,
of one per cent interest over a long period
of years. The losses to date are on loans
only one, two, three or at the outside four
years old, and the principal is not due for
years to come. Already there is $295,000 of
interest in arrear. When Dr. MacLean gave
us that figure I said it was pretty near talf of
the interest due. No doubt it will not be
all or nearly all loss, but we are in no position
yet to measure the results of this policy. I
think it will be at least ten years before we
are able to measure those results, and then
we can do it merely in a tentative way. With
twenty or twenty-five years' experience we
shall have some real basis upon which ta
make estimates. But with more than 35 per
cent in arrear nowr, te indeed would be an
optimist who would think that one-half of
one per cent would te sufficient to take care
of losses on farm oans. I do not care how
careful your appraisers are, nor hiow successful farming over a period of years may be,
there will still te mistakes which one-balf of
one per cent will not cover. You are still
going to encounter vicissitudes of all sorts.
Any one who tas had to do with these matters
will never for a moment feel that the losses
will be covered by the rcserve set out in the
Bill.
If a case could be made out for a lower
rate, it would be this, that the higher you
make your interest the harder it is to collect,
and the lower you keep it the better probably
are the chances of collection. But at the same
time the lower rate invites a procession of
borrowers, and that, I fear, will be very hard
to resist. I hope the House will not be inclined to lessen the very small margin now
provided against losses. It would endanger
the measure ta reduce the rate of interest
beyond what is the business level. It is true
we can borrow money now cheaper than before,
and I hope our crcdit remains good; but surely
we are on the wrong track when we get into
the position where the Government borrows
all the money and does all the lending, and
there is an end of the old system of individuals seeking their own investments, being
guided by their own judgment, taking their

böU

JUNE 27, 1934
own losses and making their own gains. We
are surely launching too far into this newer
field. Why, to-day if a person buys anything
but a -Government bond he is considered to
be a speculator. Buy a Government bond
and you are all right. We are entering into
so many things that I fear Government bonds
may get into the class of many other bonds.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If we do
not check ourselves soon we shall be started
down the abyss, the end of which I do not
like to contemplate.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I would remind the
right honourable gentleman that chattels are
taken only as a security in addition to the
second mortgage.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is quite
right, the chattels are an extra security. There
is not, I think, a specific loan against the
chattels; not under this section anyway; but
on loans up to two-thirds of the value the
losses are likely to be such that the small
percentage provided here to cover them will
not prove excessive.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I say another
word with regard to arrears? I think my right
honourable friend should have explained that
about one-half of the arrears are in the province of Alberta, and that the debt adjustrment
boards have interfered with the collection
work of the Farm Loan Board. By virtue of
this Bill the debt adjustment boards can no
longer interfere with the operations of the
Farm Loan Board.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. What
the honourable senator is thinking of, probably, is the statement I. made in the committee, that in my opinion there was no
jurisdiction in the debt adjustment boards of
the provinces to interfere with the Government of Canada in collecting its own loans.
I have not seen any clause in the Bill which
altered that situation at ail. I do not see
how any clause could have such an effect.
To explain My
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
point I may say that by paragraph a of section 7 of the Canadian Farm Loan Act it
is provided:
Mortgages taken as security for farm loans
and remedies thereunder shall be in all respects
subject to the law of the province in whieh the
farm land rnortgaged is situate.
By the Bill we amend paragraph a of section
7 and leave those words out. I understood
the purpose was to give the Board authority
over the Debt Adjustment Board in Alberta
or in any other province. That was the point

I made when I referred to the fact that the
arrears which my right honourable friend
cited as against the security of the second
mortgage are arrears created by reason of
that original provision. We are removing that
and leaving the Board free to enforce collection of arrears, as my right honourable friend
explained to the committee the Board should
do.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am grateful to the honourable member. That fact
was not called to the attention of the committee at all. Apparently under the old Act
the Board was specifically made subject to
the provincial law. I should not like to
express an opinion, but assuming the section
really made it subject to provincial law, and
therefore to the activities of the Debt Adjustment Board, then the amendment which the
honourable member reads would remove that
subjection. In that I think the honourable
member is quite right. But I do not think
that to the Debt Adjustment Board is
attributable any substantial share of the
present arrears.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In that province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
that in large part they would be arrears if
the Debt Adjustment Board were not there.
In fact, conditions have not enabled the
farmers to pay. It may be the honourable
gentleman is correct in saying we could have
collected more but for the Debt Adjustment
Board.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It was encouragement to the borrower not to pay. The Debt
Adjustment Board protected him.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Sinclair was
negatived.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was rea-d the third time, and passed.
CANADIAN

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill F, an Act to
amend the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act, and moved concurrence
therein.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members of the Senate, in committee there
was considerable discussion on the amendments now before us, one of them particularly engaging the attention of the committee for some time. I shall not state what

SENATE
took place in committee, because it would
not be in order to do so; but, with all due
respect, I may say I am firmily convinced
that the House of Commons did not have a
clear understanding of the effect of one of
these amendments. There was a gencral disposition on the part of the House of Commons to object to Lloyd's being relieved of
the necessity of making a deposit whben
seeking a federal licence, such an exemption
not being granted under the Bill to other
British companies. As we learned from statements appearing in the press, that was the
principal objection of the commoners, and
it was met by the amendme.nts now before
us. However, one amendmnent went much
further. We are legislating to control British
companies, but one organization is excepted.
I think the other House, as well as a number
of members of this Chamber, will be surprised to find that Lloyd's, being now freed
from obligations to which other British companies are subject, are not only removed
from federal control, but inferentiallv are
allowed to do business throughout Canada
Furthermore,
under provincial aut-hority.
they are now deprived of the opportunity of
coming to the federal authorities for a licence.
It has been said, and will be repeated, that
Lloyd's have already obtained licences from
one or two of the provinces and can obtain
them from other provinces, and the Privy
Council bas declared tbat the provincial
authorities have the right to grant licences
to insurance companies. Yet under our jurisdiction in bankruptcy and insolvency we
claim to exercise control over British companies doing business in Canada. If we have
such control it should be applied to al.1 companies, and it was for this reason that I
moved in committee for the restoration of
control by the federal authorities over all
British companies, including Lloyd's.
I would point out to the Government and
the public that although the amendments are
intended by the House of Commons to place
all British insurance companies on an equal
footing by withdrawing from Lloyd's the
privilege conferred on them by the Bill as it
left this Chamber, Lloyd's are now given permission to roam at large throughout the
Dominion, doing business without any federal
control whatever. It is against the granting
of a privilege to one organization that I
register my protest. I do not intend to test
the opinion of the Senate by again moving
the amendment which was rejected in committee, because the right honourable leader
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) has said that he
could not accept that amendment in the
name of the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? I do not quite
understand the working out of the insurance
law as between the Federal Government and
the provincial governments.
I un.derstand
from the statement just made that Lloyd's
may now take out a licence in each province
in Canada and (o business in each under the
law. My question is this: Do not the provinces wbich exercise the right of granting
licences exercise some measure of control and
supervision over the companies to which they
grant licences? Or bas it been left entirely
to the Federal Government to supervise the
various companies that have taken out a
federal as well as a provincial licence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There are but
three provinces that have insurance departments, which are working satisfactorily:
these are Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia.
The other provinces maintain no
such superintendence and trust to the well
organized federal Department of Insurance to
exercise control.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, my chief objection to tbis amendment bas been more than well expressed by
the honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). The difficulty is that Lloyd's
could not take out a licence for the whole of
Canada, even if they wanted to do so. The
authority which the Minister had under the
old Act to issue such a licence is to be cancelled and Lloyd's will bc able to operate
only through provincial machinery.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman a question? I understand that in the past Lloyd's could apply for
and secure a federal licence, although their
organization was such that the necessary
deposit could not be made. Am I right in
that?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Partially, but
not altogether.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There was some discussion on the Bill, and I understood that
Lloyd's, instead of being a corporation, were
some kind of peculiar organization which
could not comply with the requirement to
make a deposit in Canada. What I should
like to know is how they were able to get a
licence in the past if they could not make
that deposit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that they have obtained a licence from the
province of Quebec, but I very much doubt
that they made a deposit. Llovd's are conmposed of a number of groups of individuals.
The State of Illinois insisted on a deposit

JUNE 27, 1934
being made by the organization, and one was
made on its behalf, but it is claimed that the
money was put up by the brokers and not by
the organization itself. As a matter of fact,
Lloyd's have a considerable sum in moneys
or securities on deposit with Canadian insurance companies for which they take reinsurance. We were told that this deposit
amounted to $150,000, and that it had been
accumulated by premiums being left in the
hands of companies which reinsure with them.
A letter received by the Superintendent of
Insurance from one of Lloyd's representatives
stated there should not be very great difficulty
in transferring these moneys or securities to
the federal treasury as a deposit for a licence.
That is a question of procedure.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Perhaps I may
now continue, but I do not know how my
remarks will look with that sandwiched between them. The point I am trying to make
is that under this amendment Lloyd's would
be unable to take out a federal licence, even
though they changed their minds and wanted
one, because the Minister will no longer have
authority to accept their application. When
we were dealing with the Bill it was argued
very strongly that Lloyd's were not in a
position to make a deposit in Canada, owing
to the fact that the British Act required them
to leave their securities in Great Britain. The
statement was made, and has not been successfully contradicted, that they have money
on deposit with companies who are their
agents in Canada.
It strikes me that if Lloyd's were given to
understand that it was essential for them to
make a deposit in Canada, they could furnish
the necessary security, even though a change
in the British Act might be necessary. A
cable was received stating that Lloyd's did
not want a federal licence in this country,
and on the strength of that the right honourable leader of the Government made a
strong argument. Nevertheless I am still of
the opinion that our legislation should be
based on what would appear to be equality
as among all the British companies, rather
than on a suggestion by Lloyd's. This amendment will give Lloyd's greater privileges than
they enjoy under the present law. In future
they will be allowed te roam wherever they
like, subject to no federal control whatever,
and there will be no way of putting them
under federal control even if they themselves
want to be subject to it.
The matter is undoubtedly a difficult one
to adjust. From conversations I have had
with members of the House of Commons--I
mean of the rank and file-I believe that they
did not understand the full meaning of this

amendment. They chided me as a member
of the Senate for having assisted in passing a
Bill to which that House would not agree.
Their point was that we would permit Lloyd's
to register in Canada without making a
deposit, and that this permission would be
inimical to the interests of the other British
and Canadian insurance companies. But the
amendment has not improved the Bill in that
respect, for it simply prohibits Lloyd's from
registering with the federal department. They
will not be able to make any deposit in the
future, even should they be desirous of doing
so, and the Minister will no longer have the
power to accept an application from them for
a licence. That is the view I had, but the
right honourable leader of the Government
thought it was not practical, particularly as
Lloyd's had cabled that they did not want
to come under the Act at all. It seemed
to me that we might amend the Bill so as
to enable Lloyd's to take out a Canadian
licence if they so desire, but not to compel
them to take one.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Without a deposit?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No, not without a deposit.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
By making a
deposit?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I would put
them in the sae category that the other
British companies are in, except that the
other companies are compelled to take out
a licence and it would be left to the option
of Lloyd's to say whether they desired to
register. I submit we should not completely
shut the door to them if they wish to comply
with the requirements of our law.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If a provision of that
kind were made would it not be necessary
to make some specification with regard to the
deposit that should be put up by Lloyd's?
My understanding is that they are not in a
position to deposit securities as other conpanies do. It may be quite true that Lloyd's
have moneys on deposit in various places in
Canada, but that faot in itself would perhaps
not enable them to comply with our deposit
requirement. So if we authorize the Minister
to grant them a Dominion licence and receive
a deposit from them, we should also state
what kind of deposit would be acceptable. I
understand this is the point that caused
trouble when the matter was previously under
consideration.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does my honourable friend think the Commons have
remedied the situation by taking away frorn
Lloyd's any opportunity to come in under the

592

SENATE

regular Act, even if they could arrange a
deposit? As my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) says, it is not worth while
dividing the House on it. We know the
difficulties, but it strikes me we should consider next session-it is too late to do so
now-whether some arrangement cannot be
made under which Lloyd's, if they wished,
could take out a Dominion licence. Under
this amendment they cannot.
Honourable memHon. E. S. LITTLE:
bers, I supported this Bill in commi.ttee and
in the House on the strength of the argument
that the Department of Insurance would be
in a much stronger position constitutionally
if Lloyd's were allowed to come in on the
basis then proposed. I supported the Bill
in the face of a storm of telegrams and letters
from insurance agents all over Western
Ontario. Their object was to get Lloyd's
By the Commons amendments
registered.
Lloyd's are refused registration, not only
under the conditions imposed by the Bill,
but absolutely. As a result they will do
business under licences from the provinces.
Then what will be our position? Are we not
in danger of having some group or aill of the
237 odd registered incorporated insurance
companies refusing to make a deposit with
the Superintendent of Insurance, and registering with the provinces, thus entirely dismembering our Insurance Department?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Privy Council
has ruled that the provinces have jurisdiction
in regard to insurance. If what m'y honourable friend from London (Hon. Mr. Little)
fears does happen, the business will only go
where it belongs.
At one o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 3 o'clock.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I do not know that any subject has
received more elaborate consideration and
discussion, both in committee and in the
House itself, than has this insurance legislation. It is not too much to assume that decisions definitely arrived at after such discussion, and certainly without the omission
of any information or facts bearing on the
case, will be maintained by the Flouse, and
therefore that it will not be necessary to
retrace our steps and occupy the time of
honourable members with discussions which
have already been completed.
The main feature I have in mind is that
dealing with Lloyd's. The problem we found
indeed complicated, and impossible to solve
along lines of clear and unvarying consistRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

ency, but it demanded the most practicable
solution, especially a solution that would
keep us in a good position from the standThe
point of our constitutional powers.
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, having beard all sides and discussed
and rediscussed every phase, recommended
that we make provision for the licensing of
Lloyd's in Canada without the deposit which
is by the Bill, and has always been, required
of other companies.
The reasons for that
recommendation I sought to give very fully,
not only when the Bill was up for second reading, but also after its emergence from the
committee. They revolve around the security
which Lloyd's underwriters are now compelled
to put up in England, under the supervision
of the Board of Trade, for the benefit not
alonc of English policyholders, but of policyholders ail over the world.
In recommending tat
provision be made
for the granting of a federal licence to Lloyd's,
who had been operating bere for many years
anyway, the committee chose, and the House
approved
of,
certain
safeguards. Lloyd's
had to enter into an undertaking that any
final judgment in Canada in respect of any
policy was equivalent to a final judgment in
England and therefore ranked against the
securities which lie there. Lloyd's also submitted to the supervision of the Insurance
Department in every detail, and all Lloyd's
underwriters' operations in this country were
subject to inspection and review by the department. These, with other conditions quite
elaborate and quite lengthy, were the terms
under which alone such a licence could be
obtained. They did not include a deposit.
As honourable members know, very considerable opposition arose from the insurance
companies operating here against the admission
of Lloyd's to Dominion licence. This opposition extended to the other House, and as a
consequence of it the Government saw fit to
alter its position. As a matter of fact, as explained when the Bill was up, it is a departmental position, not one involving policy in
any Dominion sense. The alteration took this
form. that• the provisions we made for the
admission of Lloyd's to Dominion licence were
struck out and a series of amendments adopted
with one objective only, namely, to leave any
underwriter of Lloyd's entirely out of the purview of the Bill. In a word, the Bill as
amended by the House of Commons has no
application to Lloyd's at all.
The honourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) has taken exception to the
Commons amendment, on the ground, as I
appreciate his argument, that it leaves Lloyd's

however, that they are in a position under
the law of England to deposit with other
governments securities for the benefit of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bas been done in Illinois.

The same thing

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member is again harking back to Illinois.
We have threshed out Illinois from boundary
to boundary, over and over again. The difficulty in Illinois was overcome by the agents
there keeping their balances at a certain point,
and thereby retaining in that state enough
money to satisfy the requirements. But that
does not mean that a deposit was made by
Lloyd's. The moneys were merely the agents'
balances. That would not meet the situation
in Canada.
I press upon the House the futility of endeavouring to argue that Lloyd's do not know
whether they can or cannot do this thing.
Surely they know their own position. I have
before me a telegram received to-day from the
Chairman of Lloyd's, and in the face of this
telegram I ask the House if it is the part of
practical legislative prerogative to make a
provision for federal licence and deposit. I
shall not read the first part of the telegram,
because it refers to the Superintendent of Insurance and bas to do with an incident that
need not be rehearsed here. I read from the
point at which this subject-matter is covered:
Position of Lloyd's is what it lias always
been, namely that under British Assurance
Companies Act funds must

be kept

in trust

here and cannot be allocated for purpose of
deposit either in Canada or elsewhbere.
This is signed "Chairman, Lloyd's" and is
dated the 27th of June.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is the name
of the Chairman?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is just
signed "Chairman, Lloyd's." I think we had
his name.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It does not matter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This being se,
I do net see any object at all in inserting the
proposed amendment. If the British law
should be changed, then, of course, we could
consider the subject anew; but at present it
would not comport with our position and
function to put in this suggested provision,
this particularly when it is not by way of
amendment to the amendments now before us.
Our committee felt, and I think I can say
by a large majority, that the proper course
was to accept the Bill as amended by the
other House. Without question the Bill is
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

just as formidable constitutionally and just as
thoroughly fortified as before.
Therefore,
from that standpoint, which is our main concern, we are all right. As a mechanism for
taking care of a complicated difficulty it is
not, I think, the equal of the Bill passed by
this House; but it is the next best thing.
I think this House is of the same temperament as most people at this time; so surely we
had better keep within confines which we feel
are safe, and not invite a contest whichb might
be very perilous and result in a situation
which would be exceedingly calamitous to
very large and important interests in this
country and would affect almost everybody
within its boundaries.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think the right
honourable gentleman might, for the benefit
of those who are not familiar with it, tell us
just what Lloyd's are. I think I could tell the
HouseRight Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN: Go ahead.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I would sooner give
way to the right honourable gentleman.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I doubt
whether I could do it any better than my
honourable friend. I do not think I know
as much about the details.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I bave had some
dealings with them.
A couple of hundred years ago Lloyd's was
a sort of tavern, similar to one in Montreal
called Joe Beef's. The sea captains met at
Lloyd's and talked about the ships they bad
met on their voyages, and where they had
met them. Naturally the owners also went
to Lloyd's to learn what they could about
their ships. Insurance in those days was the
reverse of what it is to-day. A captain might
sell out to a pirate, but if he came back
with a cargo he would be paid.
To-day there is a large room, larger perhaps
than this Chamber, with desks in it, where
the business is done. If you want to insure
a ship you go to a broker who bas taken a
risk on her before, or one who knows her
well and believes that she is seaworthy and
that ber captain is an able man. Yeu tell
him of the voyage the ship is to make, and
you go through many formalities. If the
destination of the ship is changed, the right
to insurance may be lost. Suppose the risk
is a small one, say £10,000: the agent who is
seeking to insure goes to a broker, who writes
the particulars on a slip of paper and signs
for, say. £2.000; then he goes to another man,
who may net know quite se much about the
ship, but who when be sees the first name
says, "I will take £1,500." After that it is

JUNE 27, 1934
easy ta secure the balance. These brokers,
wba have clients tbroughout England, immediately telegraph or telephone them and
say: "We have taken £10,000," or whatever
the amaunt may be. "Do yau want any of

it?" The client says, "Yes, I will take came
af it," or hie may take tbe wbole amnount.
In this way the brokers are able witbin an
bour or so ta secure substantial people wha
are willing ta take over the risk. There is
no company. Everytbing je based on confidence. You go ta the first man because you
have confidence in him, and the people who
take the risk. off bis bande take it because
tbey also bave confidence in him.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Does the bonaurable
gentleman realize that bie is speaking of
marine insurance and that this Bill bas notbing ta do witb that at all?

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I neyer beard of
that, and neyer gat it myself, but I bave

cent, witb a maximum of fifteen per cent.
They bave agente aIl over the world, wbo

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, in
accordance with the resolution of the World
Monetary and Economic Conference.
Lt becames necessary for me ta refer ta
two statutes which pravide for note issues
over and ahove the requirements set out in
the. general Act ta which I have already
referred. The Dominion Notes Act of 1915
pravides for the suppuementary issue of
Dominion notes ta the banks for special
purpases during the grain season. Under the
Finance Act -of 1927 provision was made for
advances ta the hanks on deposit of approved
securities. -Aocording ta the statement in the
other House, an May 31, 1934, there was outstanding under the Act of 1915 S26,000,O, of
which $16,000,000 is secured and $10,000,000
unsecured; under the second Act $38,444,000
lias been advanced; and $106,666,949 is outstanding under the Dominion Notes Act of
1914: a total of $171,110,949. The gold against
this, if taken at the old statutory value of
$20.67 per ounce, would be $69,537,952. This
is in itself a very large reserve, mare than
the statutory requirement, beiug 40-6 per
cent of the total note issue; but at the
present price of gold it is 52 per cent. Honourable members will agree at once that 52
per cent, or even 40 per cent, is a higli percentage, and that in this regard the Dominion is in a very strang position.

CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Murdock in the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2, the preaimble and thle titie
were agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third tîme, and passed.
CENTRAL BANK BILL
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand the
Central Bank Bill will be adopted by the
House of Commons this afternoon. If we
adjourn during pleasure and meet again this
afternoon we may receive the Bill from the
other House and refer it ta the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. At
6 a'clock we can get the Bill under way, sa
the Banking and Commerce Committee may
deal with it to-morrow.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
Aýfter some time the sitting was resumed.
Right Hýon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the reason for aur meeting at this
unusual hour was the expectation that by this
time the Bill regarding the Central Bank, or
the Bank of Canada, would have reached this
House from the other Chamber. Again we are
disappointed. There is no Bill yet. However,
as we may expeet it ta arrive shortly, and
want ta send it ta the Committee on Banking and Commerce as soon as passible, I
move that when the House adj ourns ta-day
it stand adjaurned until 12.45 p.m. ta-morrow.
This will enable us ta send the Bill ta the
Committee on Banking and Commerce early
in the afternoon.

NATURAL PRODUCTS MARKETING
BILL
AMENDMENTS NOT INSISTED UPON
SENATE
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
members, a message has been received from
the House of Commons, reading as follows:
Resolved that a message be sent to the Senate
to acquaint Their Honours that this House
disagrees with their lst and 2nd amendments
to the Bill No. 51, an Act to improve the
methods and practices of marketing of natural
products in Canada and in export trade, and
to make further provision in connection therewith, for the following reasons:
Inasmuch as wheat producers should not be
treated in a different way from other
producers of farm products;
Also, the Natural Products Marketing Act
does not conflict with the Canada Grain Act
in the case of wheat, nor in the case of coarse
grains which are included in the Act, and to
which no exception has been taken.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, as stated in the message which has
just been read, the House of Commons has
disagreed with the amendments moved by
the honourable gentleman from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Molloy) and carried in this House
on division. At the time the amendments
were moved, while recognizing that much
could be said in support of them, I asked the
House te decline them, and, largely for the
first reason set out in the memorandum to
which we have just listened-namely, that
it is better to have all natural products
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN.

treated alike-to accept the Bill without any
change. Possibly there is some force in the
second reason given by the Commons, though
I do not attach to it the same importance as
that House apparently considered it to have.
The Senate felt that this measure would
virtually give the Government power to
repeal the Grain Act, but the message intimates that the inclusion of wheat under the
legislation would not prevent the
new
machinery of the Grain Act from still being
used.
I move that the Senate do not insist upon
its amendments, but accede to the position
that has been taken by the other House. I
hope this motion will be agreed to, for I
fear that otherwise a very important measure
would be imperilled.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: On my own part
-for I have not consulted my colleagues-I
shall not vote that the Senate insist upon its
amendments. But it strikes me that with all
the machinery now available for the marketing of grain there will be a tendency to help
wheat producers to form a pool, and an attempt to coerce some producers into joining
it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
there will be any disposition to coerce wheat
producers. I do not know what would be my
state of mind if any such disposition were in
evidence.
The motion was agreed te.
EXCISE BILL
INSISTENCE UPON SENATE AMENDMENTS
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, a message has been received from the
House of Commons, reading as follows:
Resolved that a message be sent to the Senate
to acquaint Their Honours that this House
disagrees to their amendments to Bill 89, an
Act to anend and consolidate the Excise Act,
for the following reason:
Namely, that the said amendments do not
fully assure protection to the revenues of the
Crown.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am in a
very different state of mind with respect to
this message. Needless to say, ceonsiderable
discussion has taken place since the amendments were inserted. One honourable member of this House took the trouble to go over
the American legislation, from which our Act
appears to be almost verbally derived, and
he found that the United States does not
venture to go so far as our department has for
years been going, namely to the extent of confiscating the property of entirely innocent,
law-abiding citizens on the ground that such

BANK 0F CANADA BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the Hause
of Commons with Bill 19, an Act ta incorporate the Bank af Canada.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN, with leave of
the Senate, moved the second reading of the
Bill.
Re said: Honourable senators, in support
of rny motion for second reading, without
notice, of this important mneasure, I wil
rnerely say that there is only one principle
ta be considered. That principle is whetber
we shall or shalH not have a Central Bank
in this country. There may be differences of
apinion as ta the proposed plan for 1-ulfilling
and implementing that principle-as, for instance, whether the IBank should be Government-owned-hut in passing the second reading we decîde only one thing, namely, that
we should have a Central Bank.
The measure cornes to us fram the ather
Hause after a long debate there, a debate
which bas doubtless affarded an opportunity
for honourable senators ta acquaint themselves thoroughly with the ternis of the pro-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I intended ta ask the Senate ta came back at
6 o'clock. I do not know how we can very
welb avoid that. I am somewhat embarrassed
by the situation with respect ta the Shipping
Bill, for the Fren.ch version has not reached
us, and my understanding is that it simply
must be here befare we can finally dispose
of the measure.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is not time
for long speeches at this bate hour of the
session. I have a few remarks ta make, and,
as it is lunch time, perhaps we shoubd adjourn
until 3 a'clock. I can go on now if honourable members desire.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggeet
that the honourable senatar reserve bis
general remarks until the motion for third
reading is made, if that wauld suit his conveniefice.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: 1 arn sorry, but
I have ta go away. The motion is for
second reading, and, as the right honourable
gentleman bas stated, we bave ta decide upon
the principle whether we should or sho-uld
not have a Central Bank. Ail rny rernarks
will be an that point. If the Bouse desires,
I can make thern now.

600

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have no
right to prevent the honourable member from
speaking on this motion, and I suggest that
we meet again at 3 o'clock.
At one o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 3 o'clock.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
members, long speeches are not wanted
within a few hours of prorogation. Therefore
I am sorry to say I shall not be able to
place fully before the House the conclusions
I bave reached on the public questions that
I have been studying since last October.
I remember very well what took place in
this Chamber at the opening of the session
-the
perennial declaration that the Senate
would take sufficient time to give full consideration to measures that might be received
from the other Hoiuse within a few hours of
prorogation. I suppose the same condition of
affairs will last as long as our parliamentary
system, for ail Governments hold back highly
controversial measures until nearly the end of
the session, when the minds of parliamentarians are not on legislation, but on the
prospect of going home to their wives and
children. I hope this measure will be given
due consideration by the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, and be so
amended that the proposed Bank of Canada
will be a purely Canadian institution and
absolutely free from control by the Bank of
England, if it can be avoided.
During the last eight months I have asked
various bankers and members of our stock
exchanges if they knew of a single thing that
our ten chartered banks could not do that this
wonderful Bank of Canada might be able to
do. Each and all answered me that they
did not know of any. I have been told over
and over again that our banking system is as
good as any in the world. It is the pride of
Canada, and it should be the pride of the
Senate.
As a member of this House for more than
half the period of its existence, I have witnessed the work of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce. When I came
here first it was the custom for every new
member to serve so many years of probation
before appointment to that standing committee. Not until the wise heads had decided that such and such an honourable member would be an acquisition was he fortunate
enough to be included in its membership.
The Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours was always considered to be imHon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

portant, but Banking and Commerce was regarded as the banner committee. In 1900
Sir George Drummond was chairman. He
was vice-president of the Bank of Montreal.
The president, Lord Strathcona, being a good
Scotchman, preferred to hold what he had,
and would not resign; so Sir George became
acting president. Naturally, as he was doing
the work, he desired to become president. It
is said that at a meeting of the directors Lord
Strathcona was heard to whisper, "Poor
Drummond is looking very weak, isn't he?"
And Strathcona was Drummond's senior by
fifteen years or more!
As I have said, Sir George Drummond,
acting president of the Bank of Montreal, was
chairman of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce. Ho was not always
satisfied to take even the advice of the late
Law Clerk of the Senate. I am glad to pay
homage to Mr. Creighton's memory. He was
consulted by the very best lawyers, men who
had been Attorneys-General of their provinces,
and they always knew that their private bills
were in proper form once Mr. Creighton had
O.K'd them. I hope that in the near future
there will be a Law Clerk on the staff of the
Senate, for it is a great help to senators who
have not the advantage of being members of
the legal profession to have an official to prepare bills that will hold water. We were
fortunate in that, after the loss of Mr. Creighton. the honourable member from De Salaberry, the late Senator Béique, took charge, as
it were, of our legislation. He did not spare
himself. He read ail bills, annotated and
amended them, and I can truthfully say that
during the thirty vears he was in this Chamber
there was no legislation that did not show
marks of his painstaking and critical study.
I repeat, I hope that next session we shall
again have a Law Clerk. It would be his duty
to put annotations on bills, to show that certain clauses are standard, and te draw to the
attention of the chairman of the standing committee to which each bill is referred the sections dealing with questions of policy and so
on.
Ail the banking legislation used to originate
in this Chamber. I do not think I am wrong
in saying that the House of Commons never
made any amendments to any bank legislation
that we had passed. nor disputed our action
in regard to bank measures that we rejected.
At the time I arm speaking of there were
thirty-two chartered banks in Canada; to-day
we have only ten.
Is our banking system to be changed now
by the introduction of something that nobody
wants, except it be Mr. Montagu Norman?

JUNE 28, 1934
That is the price we have to pay for all the
liberties and privileges we got under the
Statute of Westminster, passed on December
11, 1931-seventeen months after the present
Government came into office.
When the Macmillan Commission came to
Montreal they held a meeting in the courthouse, and naturally I went there to see what
they were doing. Perhaps I take my duties
too seriously, but I really believe that every
senator should try to study all the various
problems coming before this honourable House
and give us the benefit of whatever information he may have secured, much of which, no
doubt, would be of considerable value. I
t
invite my colleagues · o interest themselves
in public questions during the recess and
gather information for the benefit of those
members who perhaps have neither time nor
inclination to do so.
While the Macmillan Commission held their
seance in the Montreal court-house the chairman of the stock exchange appeared and gave
evidence. He stated he was in favour of a
Central Bank, as it was called, because he
thought it would make a money market in
Montreal, and then we should no longer have
to depend on New York. Well, a money
market is not made like that. There is no
more chance of making a money market in
Montreal than there is of making one in
Dawson City. A money market is of slow
growth. It took more than one hundred years
for the money market in London to become
what it is to-day, with four hundred million
pounds sterling, two billions of dollars, behind
it. How long would it take to establish a
money market in Montreal, or in New York,
for that matter, with any such sum for purposes of regulation? I will not go into details; I know my limitations. I realize that
there can be no money market in Montreal,
but because he thought such a market might
be established the president of the stock
exchange was in favour of the Central Bank.
I predict, and I defy contradiction, that if
God permits me to live until another session
I shall see half the branches of our banks
closed by reason of the loss of privilege of
issue, and the necessity of paying interest on
the money they will have to get from the
Bank of Canada to put into their branches.
I am net in. a position to say whether the
closing of half our banks is good or bad. I
have heard it said in this House, and outside,
that the Northwest was much-better off, and
the people there much more prosperous, when
there were hardly any banks in that country.
Honourable gentlemen will admit, however,
that if the windows of the banks in many little
places are boarded up, and padlocks put on

601

the doors, the people there will have to go
some distance before they will be able

to

find another bank. It was the people of the
Northwest who favoured the Central Bank.
They thought they would be able to get more
accommodation; but they will find they will
get none from the Central Bank.

The privilege of note issue, which has been
worth at least $100,000 a year to the bigger
banks, will be eut off. It is true that the
operation will not be performed all at once;
the banks will be allowed to suffer for some
time; but ultimately the only bills issued will
be those of the Bank of Canada. The agony
will be prolonged unless Parliament gets back

its common sense and abolishes this plan, as
I hope it will do.
The Central Bank will not pay any interest
on deposits. Who is going to deposit money
in that bank? I for one will not.
It is a strange thing that when the Bank
of Canada was talked of, when inflation commenced-for there is no denying that we have
it-the banks did not care. They thought
the value of the gold they held would be
enhanced so that about $1,.000,000 in gold
would pay for $3,000,000 in paper. They
were laughing up their sleeves, thinking they
were going to get richer, and they remained
neutral. They said nothing, and the press
said nothing. Everybody was happy and contented. Later it was found the depositor was
to have only twenty-five per cent metallic
coverage. The bankers had thought they
were going to do the public and make money,

but they themselves got caught. They had
expected to get $35 an ounce for their gold.
Not at all! Mr. Montagu Norman came
along and said, "Give us your gold and we
will give you $20.67 for it." They said, "But
we can get $35." To that he replied: "Never
mind what you can get. Come across."
Then the bankers commenced to laugh on the
other side of their faces. The joke was on
them. They got caught at their own game.
They thought they were going to do the

public, but the present Government is doing
them.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Protecting
the publie.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The situation, in
regard to gold is rather funny. If the man
on Mars could only look down at the earth
he would have a good laugh. In many places
the earth is being rent and torn asunder,
and mountains are being pulverized into dust,
in giant mortars, so that grains of the yellow
metal may be recovered. As soon as they

are recovered they are rushed to burglar-proof
cellars and kept there under guard.

came here with a purpose. It was written al
over their faces at the meeting in Montreal
which I attendad; and they aven secured
f rom the chairman of the board of the stock
exchange, a gentleman whom my leader knows
v<ery well, the admission that it would be a
fine thing to have a money market in
Montreal.
On the othar side of the Commission was
Sir Thomnas White, one of the greatest men

He was a good Liberal, but when he was

as La Banque Canadienne Nationale.
I leave it to honourable mambars to say
wbether these two men were not better
acquaintad with Canadian hanking matters
than were the two strangers who came here
for a few weaks. These two well-informed
Canadians were opposad to a Can.tral Bank.
Who decided in favour of it? A gentleman
wbo is Frime Minister of Alberta, Mr. Brownlee. In my opinion hîs mind was at that time
on something else than a Central Bank. If
honourable members read the papers they will
know what I mean.
A Central Bank bas bean astablished in the
Commonwealth of Australia, in the Dominion
of New Zealand, in tha Union of South Africa
and in India. We are the last of the British
Dominions to get such an institution. Under
the Statu-te of Westminster we were given
absoluta political control of all our affaîrs.

SENATE

Some of us think we have not made much use
of that gift. At any rate, we are now paying
through the nose for it. I know my limitations, and some of these questions are remote
from me, but I am informed that we shall
absolutely lose control over our financial affairs
if this Central Bank is established; so I say
we are paying dearly for what we received
under the Statute of Westminster, whereas
what Great Britain gave us cost her nothing.
This is an age of machinery, of mergers
and of one-man control.
Mr. Montagu
Norman is a great showman. Unlike Bernard
Shaw, ho shuns publicitv. Bernard Shaw is
very clever, but Mr. Montagu Norman is a
genius. Shaw may, by shocking people, lose
the sale of a book or two, but Mr. Norman
loses millions of pounds in international finance. The French actually forced England
off the gold standard. I suppose Mr. Norman
will net mind what I say about him. Perhaps
he will never hear about my remarks, but if
he does I shall bo glad. He refuses to corne
to Canada, and if perchance ho takes a Canadian steamship which lands him in Quebec
there is a motor car at the dock to rush him
by the shortest route to the United States.
Canadian bankers have tried-I know whereof
I speak-to hold a conference with him, but
he says: "You have ten banks. I have no
time to talk to ten banks." They invite him
to dinner at the Mount Royal Club and tell
him all the principal Canadian bankers will
be there, but ho says: "No. Get a Central
Bank." Whv is he so keen about. having a
Central Bank in Canada? Although he shuns
publicity, whenever he travels all the camera
men are tipped off to take a good picture of
him, with his slouch hat, and showing even
the sex appeal-the new wife ho has recently
taken.
Canada has been cajoled into establishing
a Central Bank. One thing I hope is that
we shall steer clear of the Bank of England.
To prevent any error I have written out a
few lines, which I will now read. Montagu
Norman and Stanley Baldwin were sent to
the United States by Mr. Bonar Law, the then
Prime Minister of Great Britain, to see what
terms they could make for the settlement of
the British war indebtedness. Their instructions were to come back and report to Mr.
Law whiat the Americans wanted. but in place
of that they took it upon themselves--I say
"themselves," but the financial adviser must
have been the Governor of the Bank of
England-to settle with the United States
Government upon the onerous terms that
it is now found impossible to fulfil. On
landing at Southampton Mr. Norman told the
press what they had done. The British GovHon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

ernment was thereby practically bound to
carry out their absurd settlement. I know
this fact to be absolutely correct. They had
instructions not to settle, but simply to see
what the Americans wanted and thon come
back and report. This was stated in the
British House of Commons by Mr. Bonar
Law's own son. I was given this information
from a very reliable source, but as J never
take my facts from any one person, I sougbt
some proof. It took me some time to find
exactly what I wanted, wbich was at page
119 of Volume 279 of the English Hansard
of 1932-33. On the 13th of June, 1933. Mr.
Richard Law, after telling how bis father
deprecated this settlement, said:
I remember his saying at that tine too,
when he had had time to think it over, that he
would sooner have broken up his own Government, new and fresh as it was at that tineit was only a few mionths old-and retired
permanently from public life than accept the
settlement which lie did accept. I do not think
lie would have accepted it. if it had not been
for the fact that he was at the timae a very
sick man.
Now, to conclude.
This Government is
powerless. It thinks that as a matter of
political expediency and in order to outsmart
the Liberals and the 'C.C.F. it must establish
some sort of Central Bank. There is only one
thing left to be done, and that is for you
Canadians to get busy and sec to it that a
purely Canadian institution is launched and
securely moored, to ensure against its being
drawn into the tow of the Bank -of England
or the Federal Reserve Bank, on the pretext
of intra-Imperial or international collaboration, or of controlling exchange. Strive for
a simple structure, restricted to the two functiens which a Central Bank will be able to
perform in this debtor country-a country
dependent upon prices for primary products
as fixed in world markets. Your wheat pool
left the taxpayer holding the bag; your railway pool is a worse mess than any dare
admit; and now you are doomed to be landed
with a bank pool, and possibly a foreign exchange pool.
But the situation is not hopeless. Botter to
be an upstanding maple sapling than a parasitic ivy clinging to an oak. Canada can
still be daughter in ber mother's house, yet
mistress in her own. It is unthinkable that
she would not continue to co-operate wholeheartedly in family matters, while insisting
upon running her domestie affairs in her own
way, in the hope of becoming in time sufficiently independent and self-respecting to
make regular voluntary contributions towards
the service of keeping up the old home.
Happy thought! The former Norman period
in England started in 1066 and came to an

period mnust be approaching its close, for the
press is beginning to say things, and England
is already takin-g on signs of new life. Se,
notwithstanding the foregoing nightmare, it
rnay be a long, long tirne before Macaulay's
New Zealander "takes his stand on a broken
arcli of London Bridge to sketch the ruins of
St. Paul's."
Yes, indeed, it will be worth our while to
retain the respect of Great Britain. That can
best be donc by showing sorne real spunk
right now, and resisting the clever attempt
to shackle us to the Central Bank chain gang.
Hon. J. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
I notice rule 23 requires two days' notice to
be given cf a motion for, among other purposes, the second reading of a bill. I arn
net geing te take the arbitrary position that
this Bill should net be rcad a second time
within less than t'wo days, but I do want
te make a few rernarks in connection with it.
I arn cntirely in sympathy and accord with
the proposai for a Central Bank. I think
Canada ought to control absolutely the
functions which a Central Bank would
exercise.
I cannot agree with the honourable senator
who has just spoken (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) that
a number of the rnisfortunes froma which
Canada is no>w suffcring are attributable te
organized labour. 1 think a declaration of
that kind cornes with bad grace froma a
senator whose salary for the heurs spent in
the werk of the Senate approximates $50 an
hour. He should be the last gentleman te
complain about some of the things that
organized labeur bas been able te do for the
working classes of Canada and other industrial
ceuntries of the world. But tbat is only a
side issue.
In my judgment tbis is tbe mest important
Bill that bas ever been before the Parliament
of Canada, and I shahl try bricfly to shew
wby I tbink se. The preamble shows what
is centemplated:
Whereas it is desirable te establish a Central
Bank in Canada te regulate credit and currency
in the best interests of the econornic if e of
the natien, te control and protect the external
value of the national rnenetary unit and te
mitigate by its influence fluctuations. in the
general level of production, trade, pie s and
employment, se far as rnay be possible within
the scepe of monetary action, and generalhy te
promete the econornic and financial welfare of
the Dominion: Therefore, His Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate and
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as
f ellows.
This rnorning we were asked te give second
reading te the Bill-less than sixty minutes
after it had been passed in another place.

605

Truc, had we read the newspaper reports
and tbe minutes of the Banking and Commerce Comrnittee of the House of Cemmons
we rnight have kept ourselves informed of
the general nature of the proposed legishation.
But, censidering the vital impertance of this
measure, it seems te me te be a travesty on
consistency and dccency and honest effert te,
have it dcclared that "by and with the advice
and censent of the Senate and the Heuse of
Commons of Canada" the Bill is enacted,
when we bcd netbing wbatever te do witb it
until a fcw short heurs cge.
Now, let us sec wby this Bill is se cilSubimportant and whct it contemplates.
section 3 of section 25 reads:
On the day on which the Bank ie autberized
te commence business the Minister shall
transfer te the Bank
(a) gohd beld by the Minister for redemptien
of Dominion notes;
(b) silver hehd by the Mfinister for reclemptien of Dominion notes vahuied at the market
price of the fine silver content thereof;
(c) securities of tbe Dominien of Canada
bearing interest at tbree per centiin per
annum, payable balf-yearly and baving a
maturity net exceeding five years, valued at
par;te the amnount of Dominion notes outstanding
on that day. except notes issued iinder the
autberity of the Finance Act.
In my judgment, it is centcmpiated te band
over the entire rnonetary resources of the
Dominion te the Board of Directors of the
Bank of Canada.
May I for a moment refer te another
matter wbich lias some bearing on this? A
few days cge wc passed Bill 18, an Act respecting Banks and Banking. 1 do net doubt
that the Standing Comrnittec on Bcnking and
Commerce cxamined the Bill very carefully,
but it bmas lwcys seerncd te me that less
faveured members of the Sencte are entitled
te more information than we are given as te
the why and the whereforc of proposaIs that
are decided after what would appear te, be
somewhat superficiel censideration. Bill 18
contains twenty-five references te the Bank
of Canada, a bank not yet in existence, and
tbe subjecet-matter of the present Bill. I ask
honourable senaters, is it any wonder that
the rank and file-caîl thern the raboble if
yeu wil-the erdinary citizens, say that we
are only a rubher starnp, that we are unnecessary, that we are taking rnoney under
false pretences? I have heard it said that
the Senate needs reforring-tbat it ought te
be wiped eut. Is it any wender that these
sentiments are expressed when we deai in
a hurry with rneasures se ail-important te the
future industrial hife of this Canada of ours?

606

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: llad the Bill not
passed the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK: I said a littie while
ago that, this Bill had flot passed the House
ni Commons until this morning, iess than
sixty minutes before we wvere asked to give it
second reading. 1 ar n ot finding iault particularlv; I arn trying, in relation to this aIlimportant Bill, to put before every honourable scnator facts bearing on the question
wý%hcther this is the proper consideration that
w-e sbould give to such a measure.
Now I want to deal with the set-up and
formation of the proposed bank. 1 think it
will ha worth while to put on record how the
provisionai directors are to ba appointed,
because Iater I shall deal with the manner in
which thay are to be suparsedad by a permanent corps. Subsaction 1 of section 9
reads:
Notwithstanding anything eontained in section teii of this Act. the first, or provisionai,
tlirectors of th~e Ban], shahl be the foilowing
memibers of the Civil Service of Canada,
namiy. The Daptt Ministar oi Finance; The
Cotinsellor of the Dapartnient of Externai
Affairs; The Coniptroller. Goveriiiient Guarantee
Branch;
The Comptroller
of the
Treasiury; The Cornptroiler of CnrTrenc.-y; The
Director af Estirnates anti A-ssistant Secretarv
ta the Treasrr
Board, and '[le S olicitor to
tise Treasury. who shall reiain in office unti]
replaced by directars dulv elected in their
stead at the first ganecal meeting of sharehiolders. Thse sai(1 ffrst or provi sional directors
shall serve without rernoneration.
If the Bill provided for the appointmcnt, of
a cantinuous Board of Directors of that kind,
I do not think I should take up the time of
the Housc for ona moment, because that
appears ta me to contempiate Govarnment
contra], Government domination, Goverament
responsibility. But unfortinately, as I sec it,
the Bill provides how that Govaraiment control board shall ha siiperseded by other persans. Let us analyse hriefly who thosa others
may ho. Subsectian 1 of section 5 reads:
TIse Baidk shall be under the management af
a Board of Directors conipascd of a Governor,
a Deptt' Governar and seven direetors. There
niays also be an Assistant Dapnty Govarnor.
Section 6 specifles who cannaI hoid office as
Governor or Deputy ýGovernor or Assistant
Deputy Governor. For axample, wa find that
Machado, of Cuba, cannot ha a Govarnor, a
Deputy Governor or an Assistant Daputy
Governor: hae is not a British subjact, and
therefore would not ba ahigibla. Mambers ai
aithar Housa of Parliamant ara also disqualified-and that is ail to the good. Shareholdars of any of the charterad banks ara also
ineligibla for office.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

But it seems ta me the Bill is not completely
protectiva of certain riglts. I find that subsection 1 of section 18 providas:
No shares of the capital stock of tha Bank
shal hae held by or for the banefit af any
chartered bank or any director, officer, clark or
eniployee of any such bank, and no chas-terad
bank shall have any intarest, directly or
indirectly or through the mediumn ai any
afficer, clark, employea or athar persans, in
any share af the Bank.
That sounds first-rate. But will any honourabie gentleman in this Dominion with a fair
knowiedga oi what has gona on in past yaars
say on his honour that hae is satisfied thcrc
wvil1 not ha a possibility af directors ai the
Bank of Canada coming under the influenceI will not say domination, althougli that is
what I mean-of the cha-rterad hanks?
1
think the Bill is boa wide open. lb puts ail
the financial affairs and inbares-ts oi the
Dominion into tha cara and the safa-kaeping
ai a hoard ai this kind, and Icaves it optiona]
ar permissibla for soma oi btia chartered banks
ta have the "sulent man" on the directorate,
in entira disregard oi section 18.
Tha othar day, whe.n wve passad Bill 18,
an Act respecting Banks and Banking, we
found in Scehdla A an enumaratian ai ten
banks, three ai which had an authorized
capital ai $50.000,000 apica, four an authorized capital ai $10.000,000, ana an authorized
capital of $15,000,000, one an authurized capital
ai $5,000,000, and the tanbh, Barciav's Bank,
an authorizad capital ai $500,000. Do any ai
us place so mucli confidence in human nature
that we are nat ready ta assuma that soma
ai the savan diractors ai bhe Bank ai Canada,
if not ail, wili ha in a position ai friandly
rasponsibuhity ta same ai those tan chartered
banks? Personaily, 1 think tha whola Bill is
loadad unfairly in favour ai thc charbered
banks. The highest numbar ai sharas any
man can hold is fibty. Tan sharas qualify him
ta sit as a naambar oi the Board ai Diractors.
The sharaLs cast $12.50 apiece. Thev ivili ha
prabty easilv purchased. I think it is ail ta
the good that thay should ha distribubad indiscrimînabalv. but it is altogather unfair that
thera should ha anv possihiliby ai the savan
diractors, pra-sumably high-class men, baing
favaurabla and sympathetic ta a numbar ai
the chartarad hanks ai Canada. 1 think tha
Bill ought ta ha amended in order ta make
il air-bight. The Central Bank ai Canada
should ha ana avec which the Gov-arnment
would hava the antira contrai, frea irom al
dictation other than the wire-puiiing and the
suggesting that wveail know goes on icom day
ta day under existing conditions. I do not
think il is proper that the variaus sections ai

JUNE 28, 1934
the Bill should be framed in such a way as to
give the chartered banks an opportunity to
get in on the ground floor and influence and
dominate the future work under the Act.
I think- it is a misfortune, if flot a crime,
that we should get a Bill of such importance
at this late date. It should have been placed
before us early in the session. I realize that
anything I may say, or any objection that may
be raised on this side of the House, will not
necessarily have any effect on the final disposition of the Bill. However, I do not believe the people will take kindly to a measure
which proposes putting ail the gold and silver
and sedurities of Canada into one pile and
handing them over to an institution which,
though at flrst controlied absolutely by
responsible Government officiais, will later
be taken over by an outside committee or a
body of men appointed by the sharebolders of
the Bank of Canada. I quite realize that
after further discussion the Government of the
day can pass the Bill if they so desire, but I
do not think they should do it. I do not
think they have the right to do it. or that the
sentiment of the people is behind their assumption of the right to do anything of the kind;
and I wouid earnestly suggcst that when the
Bill goes to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, as I presume it wiil, some amendments should be inserted to safeguard the
rights of the citizens of Canada and to make
this a reai Central Bank of Canada, over
which only Canada and the Government of
Canada shahl have any control.
Right Hon. Mr. MIEIGHEN: Honourable
membersHon. Mr. DANDURAjND: Before the right
honourable gentleman answers the criticism
we have heard of this measure, there is one
point that I should like to stress. I cannot
imagine that the control of this institution
wouid lie anywhere else than with the board
to be elected by the shareholders, and I have
my doubts as to the quality of a board selected
by a medley of shareholders, each of whom
has but a small interest. I wonder also what
proportion of the ehareholders will gather to
select the board. This, it seemas to me, is one
of the things that may endanger the proper
administration of this institution, which wilI
have in its keeping the wealth bhat is to-day
in the keeping of the Government of Canada.
I shouki like the right honourable gentleman
to explain to the &-nate the safeguards 'with
which t.he Central Bank wili be surrounded,
and which will ensure an administration whose
sole regard wil1 be the public weal. This institution is created to assist in maintaining
or increasing the credit of Canada; in fact,

607

to steer the financial. ship of state. How can
we be certain that under the pro-posed organization we shahl have the benefit of the wisdom
whi.ch it is claimed. is lacking under our present
system? It has been saîd that the weakness
of our present systemn is due to the fact that
there has been no clear co-operation among
the banks in influencing, directing and managing the credit of Canada. Well, we have had
the Bankers' Association. I would ask whether
thc present scheme provides safeguards which
will remedy the weaknesses of the present
system.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: Honourabie
members, for a oomplete answer to ahi that
has been aiieged in -the present debate, or even
an answer that is satisfactory to my own
mind, I would ask the Hlouse to wai*t until a
inter stage, so that I may study this enactment more thoroughly than I have yet been
able to do.
There has been opened up a sphere of
thought which I think I ought to touch on
first. I refer to the complaint addressed
somewhere, I hardly know where, by the
honourable senator fro.m Parkdaie (Hon. Mr.
Murdock), with respect to the time when this
measure, was introduced, the speed with which
it may receive the second reading, and the
discharge by this House, as the trustee of the
people of Canada, of its duties in relation to
this and other bis. I must admit frankiy
that I find it very difficult by the exercise of
any judgment I have, or by any effort or
concentration of energy on my part, to meet
the demands of the honourable senator from
Parkdale. I am at a loss to know what in the
worid could have been done to satisfy him.
or to prevent him from continually assuming
that wc are dereliet in our duty-all except
himself; that we are paîd too much for our
work-ah, again, except himseif; that we do
not arrange our programn satisfactorily or
effectively or efficiently, and tha-t we are more
or iess humbugs--alh. again. except the honourabie senator from Parkdale.
This Bill, it is true, comes to us late in the
session, reaching us only to-day. But is the
Senate or any member of it responsible for
that? Is the Government of Canada responsible for it? I do not think any person
who wants to be frank and f air would suggest
that even the Government is responsibie for
the delay; and certainly nobody who is entitled to be at large wouid suggest that the
Senate is to blame.
Early in the session the Government introd-uced two companion measures, the decennial revision of the Bank Act, and the Bank
of Canada Act. Those measures were of

SENATE
great importance and great difficulty. This is
especially truc of the second measure, because
it was breaking into new territory, while the
other was not so different from its predecessors. Both bills-the former in part and the
latter in larger measure-were the consequence of deliberations and findings of the
Banking Commission headed by Lord Macmillan. In the other House, the initial body
to deal with these bills, they had to go
through the most ponderous procedure ever
adopted. They were the subject of debate,
amendment and sub-amendment. They passed
through all sorts of vicissitudes before they
reached even the stage where they could be
referred to the appropriate committee of that
House. I have no criticism to make of the
fact that such delays occurred.
Possibly,
had I been leading the Opposition in the
other House, the expedition would not have
been any greater.
Having reached committee stage, deliberations on these measures
took not only weeks, but months. Everybody who even alleged himself to be an
expert had to be heard; almost every crank
had to be heard; and if any had been denied
a hearing, who in this House would bave
been the loudest and bitterest in his complaints? If I were to pause for an answer,
and all were to answer at once. I know what
the answer would be.
This Bill, having come back from committee into the other House, was again attacked
with renewed vigour from all sorts of
angles, amendments and sub-amendments were
offered. and although we were here ready
to receive it, it did not come. I am not
criticizing, but I do believe the man who
passes judgment on the lack of expedition
with which the Bill came here is the one
who should say who was responsible for
its delay in the other House. He should
find fault with those who delayed it, not by
implication, but by standing up manfully
and stating how it was delayed, and by
whom. I have not heard that from the
honourable senator frorn Parkdale.
Then, inferentially at least, the Bill is the
subject of momentous criticism and challenge
because it came here within sixty minutes
of its passing the other House. I think it
came within thirty minutes; but I wonder
what added virtue it would have if it had
been delayed three or four days. Should we
be any better qualified to address ourselves
to it? What criminality, or weakness, or
at least failure in fidelity to public duty, is
inherent in its coming to us within thirty
minutes of passing the other House?
Right Hon. MIr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That
point.

is not the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, that is
not a point. There was no point.
Hon. Mr. MURDO'CK: The point is that
we are ignoring our rules and trampling them
under foot when we give the second reading
to a Bill within less than sixty minutes instead of allowing two days' notice. That is
the point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very well.
Then the foot-race from one House to the
other is of no particular importance.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wondered
why it was so much stressed. What was wrong
in our unanimous waiving of the rule calling
for one or two days' notice of the second
reading?-sornething that is donc very frequently, and has to be donc if the two Houses
are to work together as the Parliament of
Canada; sonething to which all accede bccause it cannot bc avoided, and to which even
the honourable member himself gave accession. I asked for unanimous consent to move
ihe csecond reading, and gave my reasons,
stating the importance of the matter, and
nobody objected. On the motion for the
second reading I stated the principle of the
Bill, and again the honourable gentleman did
not object. I stated that the principle of the
Bill could be said to be one thing only, the
establishment of a Central Bank; that there
were differences of opinion as to how that
ought to bc accomplished, but on that point
no one was voting one way or the other at the
second reading. I suggested that anything in
the way of formal debate might be deferred
until the third reading; then, the Bill having
been reviewed in committee, we should be
in a Petter position to discuss it. Immediately
another member thought otherwise I acceded
to his position, and we went on with the
debate. This conduct is considered entirely
unworthy of the Senate. The honourable
member trembles for the fate of this body
because we took a course to which every
honourable member agreed. and by which all
stand loyally except himself.
Now I corne to a discussion of the measure.
The honourable member dislikes the Bill
because in some mysterious way, he says, it is
going te put the Central Bank under the
control of chartered banks. The bugbear
which terrorizes him is wholly different from
that which keeps the honourable senator
opposite (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) awake at nights.

JUNE 28, 1934
The Bank of England is the devil that troubles
the dreams of the lionourable gentleman from
De Lanaudière: it is the Bank of England that
is going to get a grip on us, and Montagu
Norman is going to be the successor of William
the Norman of a tliousand years ago: if the
Bill goes tbrougb, we are going to have
another Norman conquestl
The honourable senator from Parkdale says
that under this Bill shares are going to
be epread ail over the country; that nobody
can hold more than fifty shares, and that
$12.50 will be paid on each one. Anyone who
has 5625 can buy the largest number of shares
that any person or any company is entitled
to have; and if a man has only $12.50 he can
have a share.
There will be bundreds,
thoussands, prcibably tens of thousands, of
shareholders. The Bill provides that no bank
shaîl directly or indirectly, or in the remotest
way, have a share or interest in a share, or
have anything wharaver to say in the appointment of an officer of the Central Bank.' And
no officei' of the Central Bank shahl have
directly, indirectly or remotely, a share in
any other bank. But that phraseology does
flot satisfy the honourable senator from Parkdale. He wants it air-tight, so that the
chartered banks cannot get their hands upon
the Central Bank. 1 too want it air-tiglit.
I think 1 kno-w what air-tiglit phraseology
is, but 1 arn going ta invite the more highly
talented senator from Parkdale ta be present
when the camnmittee meets and move any
amendments that he thinks will more definitely
prevent the chartered banks from exercising
any influence in the contrai of the Central
Bank. Let him bring an his paste and
bis ashestos and anything else lie can think
of, and we wvill make this structure
so tliat the chartered banks cannot air-tiglit,
possibly
get inta it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
1 can tell you
riglit now what I suggest. Simply bave tlie
first paragrapli of section 9, as it now stands,
govern for all time.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is to
say, the Government of Canada would appoint
everybody?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.
Rîglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then tlie
Central Ba nk would become a brandi of thie
Government of Canada. Very well. Wliy did
not the honourable member say at firat that
lie wanted to make tliis bank a brandli of
Government? Hia suggestion involves a great
principle wbieli it is wortli whule to discuss.
I dQubt, tbougli, that thie honourabie senator
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Ca.sgrain)

609

will be in favour of that principle. And I
question wliether any man who lias bad very
much ta do with financial and money matters
will agree to it. Tlie lionourable senator from
Parkdale did not really mean to say that the
Act is not air-tiglit, that its language is not
efficienfly and lionestly designed to make it
iron-clad. What he really wants is that the
Central Bank shaHl be a Government institution, another element of Socialism in this
country. If lie will move an amendment to
that effeet there will lie a debate and we
shll test the judgment of the House. Tlie
lionourable gentleman would have been mucli
franker if lie liad told us wlien lie first rose
tliat he objected to the measure 'because the
bank was not ta lie purely a Goverament
liank, instead of suggesting tliat lis own view,
and perhaps that of somne whom lie dlaims
speciaily to represent, is tliat the Administra,tien purposes by means of looplioles and airholes to permit invasion of tlie Central Bank
by cliartered banks.
The honourable senator from De Lanaudière
complained, as I have already stated, that
the Central Bank will become a tool of the
Bank of England.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Before the right
honourable gentleman leaves me may I ask
him a question? The seven directors can be
appointed from the outside. Has my riglit
honouralile friend ever lieard of under-cover
men, and wbat is lis thouglit as to tlie possibility of sucli in tliis institution?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
knaw that there are any under-cover men
except men wbose pocketbooks are under
caver. A man wbose purse strings are not
tied to the Central Bank is flot very likely
to have his lieart stringsa tied. I do flot
know of any other reason tlian personal
interest wliy a man sliould be in an undercover position.
Coming now to the objection raised by tlie
honourable senator froma De Lanaudière, I do
not doulit tlie bona fides of bis apparition.
1 asked him ta be good enougli to, trace his
dreadful ghost to some section in this Bill,
and lie replied by paying an extravagant
compliment to myseif. I tliought tlie question was a very simple one. Wliat is tliere
in this Bill tliat ties up the Bank of Canada
witli the Bankc of England?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: You are too clever
to put it in, but it will be tliere alI tlie same.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIOGHEN: The lionourable gentleman's point is tliat notliing of
the kind is in the Bill, because of the cleverness of the draughtsman. And notbing of tlie

kind can be found anywhere except in the
elastie imagination of the honourable senator.
This Bill bas no more relation to the Bank
of England than it bas to the Bank of France.
I do not know on what ground it is said
that Mr. Montagu Norman is going to control
the Bank of Canada. My honourable friend
says that Mr. Norman advised Canada to
have a Central Bank. From the way my
honourable friend stated it I gathered that
this advice was given hastily by Mr. Norman,
on a dock in Quebee, by way of excuse for
not attending a banquet. I hope any objections made by the honourable gentleman in
future will be to what he finds in bills and
thinks should not be there, rather than to
something of horrible import which he admits
is not there at all.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
right honourable leader a question? Is it
not a fact that when members of another
place expressed the desire that a Canadian
shouild be appointed as Governor of the Bank
of -Canada they were told that this could not
be done?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. that is
not a fact. When the honourable gentleman
gets into a certain state of mind he can see
confirination net only in running brooks, but
in imaginary brooks. It was stated in the
other House that it would be unwise to restrict the appointment to Canadians, for the
reason that every Canadian who had been
prominently connected with banking in Canada had been canvassed and had refused to
take the position. Everybody knows that the
banks of this country have not looked with
favourable eyes upon this proposition.
Hon. Mr. COPP:
fused?

Has Sir John Aird re-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understood
so. I got this information only second-hand.
My understanding is that it was stated by
the Prime Minister that every man who was
or had been a general manager of a bank,
or who was in any way at all eligible, had
been conferred with, of course without being
inferentially tendered the position, and all
had stated distinctly they would have nothing to do with it. So I suppose Sir John
Aird would be included.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Sir John Aird took exception to the statement that Canadians were
not qualified for the position.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There may be
Canadians qualified for the position, but it is
net certain that there is a qualified Canadian
who will accept it. It was further pointed
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

out in the other House that any such restriction would have made it impossible to appoint
such a man as Sir Edward Peacock, a Canadian who built up a splendid reputation in bis
native land and a greater one in England. who
is familiar both through study and experience with banking conditions in both countries, and who in my opinion would be eminently qualified for the position. I ask the
House what would be the sense in providing
restrictions which would make the appointment of such a man impossible. I hope the
honourable gentleman will net adhere to the
view that the refusal to restrict appointments
to Canadians indicates the new institution is a
child of the Bank of England.
I will net pretend to answer this afternoon
the question asked by the honourable senator
who leads the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), namely: Is there sufficient provision
in the Bill te make certain that a competent
body of directors will be obtained? He
emphasizes the fact that no individual shareholder can hold more than a small portion of
the bank's stock. Not more than fifty shares
shall be held by any person other than the
Minister, and shares may be purchased with a
down payment of $12.50 each. A shareholder
who is the registered owner of ten shares is
eligible for election as a director. The honourable gentleman's point, which is well worth
study, is tbat the average shareholder will net
have a sufficiently heavy investment in the
bank to make it worth his while te sec that
only competent men are elected to the directorate. It is always a fart that men who
have most at stake in a business give most
attention to the operation of that business
and are most careful to see that their treasure
is in competent hands. Men who have very
little at stake are ordinarily not likely to
devote a great deal of consideration to such
a matter.
If the Central Bank is not to be a Government institution, it must be in charge of
men who own it. The Bill provides that directors shall be elected by the shareholders, but
the men who will really run the bank and
conduet its operations will be the Governor
and the Deputy Governor. They must be
specialists. The Governor and the Deputy
Governor will at first be selected bv the
Governor in Council, and thereafter by the
directors, but directors' choice will always
be subject to the approval of the Governor
in Couneil. That safeguard is a very important one. If it is argued that it is net
sufficient, I shall welcome any suggestion for
improving the Bill in this respect.

JUNE 28, 1934
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask another
question? Each of the seven directors can

And disagrees to their amendment to clause
17 for the reason that, unless the interest rate
is reduced to five per cent after the payment
of three months' bonus, there woild be no
inducement to the lender to accept payment.
The purpose and intent of the proposed legislation are to induce the lender, on payment
of the principal surm and interest to the date
of payment, with a bonus of three months'
interest, and thereafter by reducing the interest
rate to five per cent, to accept payment without
further delay.
Right Hon. Mr. MELGHEN: Honourable
members, I had no intimation of the scruples
of the other House in relation to this second
amendment until the moment the message
was read. It is difficult for my ponderous
mind to get the reasoning through it in time

The reason
given in the message may be good as far as

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
That is
exactly what was in my mind. If the purpose is to compel a reduction to five per cent,
there is no more reason for making a nine
per cent mortgagee come down to five per

SFANATE
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
THIRD READING

Bill 99, an Act to amend the Income, War
Tax Act.-Right Hon. Mr. Meighen.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'ciock.
BANK 0F CANADA BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTE

Rigbt Hon. G. P. GRAHAM presented
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on Bill 19, an Act to
incorporate the Bank of Canada.
He said: ilonourabie members, the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
lias had several lengthy sessions on this Bill,
and lias made a number of amendments to it.
The firqt amendment is intended to make
it clear that the Assistant Depu*ty Governor
should not perform certain duties as a member of the board.
At page 2, line 38, the word "financiai" is
s-ubstititýed for "banking."
Another amendment makes the salaries of
the board and its officers subject to the
approval cf the Governor in Council.
It was considered that the provisions against
shareholders in any chartered bank being inelibihie for the position cf director were flot
sufficientiy stringent, and these words are inserted in section 10:
-and any person noîninated for election as a
director wvho is a shareholder of a chartered
bank shall if elected divest himself cf ownership of bis shares within three months cf the
date cf bis election and shall fot thereafter
during the period of bis office have an interest,
either directly or indirectly, as a shareholder
in a ehartered bank.
It wns heid that the deposit cf 5 per cent
shouid net appiy te savings banks opera-ting
under the Quebec Savings Banks Act, these
being in a different position from the chartered banks, as they do net issue notes and
do littie discounting. There is an amendment te make it cicar that the Central Bank
can decide what wiil be a sufficient deposit
for these savings hanks te make.
Right Hon. Mr.

MEIGHEN:

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Aise, from
time te time they have te give certain information te, the Central Bank in regard te
their standing.
Then there was the question of the printing
of the notes cf the Centrai Bank. The Central Bank furnishes the notes te the chartered
flight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

banks. The original clause provided that there
shouid be one issue printed soiely i0 Frenchi,
and another issue printed soely in Engiish.
It is now provided that each note shahl be
printed in both English and French.
Then there was the election of directors.
Those who are familiar with cempany practice
know that directors can be eiected only at
the annuai meeting of the shareh eiders. The
Biii originaily provided that by-iaws could
be passed authorizing the acceptance cf
nominations in writing prier te the annual general meeting. The committee was very doubtfui whether the board would have authority te
present these nominations in writing before the
meeting cf the shareholders, and this7 clause
was addedAnd such by-laws may provide for the nomination of directors before aay annmal general
meeting and what constitutes suehi nomination.
A letter wiii be sent te the Minister, who
wiil have power te vote on the shares in
accordance with the letter. Ho wiil have the
saine authority as the director cf a company
who hoids a proxy from a sharehioider.
It was provided in the Biii that ail voting
cf the sharehoiders should be donc, by ballot.
This seemed a cumbersome method. and the
committee saw fit te restrict the voting by
ballot te the election cf directors.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN. Honourable
members, I have nothing te add te the
expianation cf the different; amendments as
given by the acting chairman cf the committee, except as regards the modifications
that affect the two Quebec savings banks.
While these institutions are calied Quebec sal'ings banks, they are Dominion incorporations
and operate under a speciai Dominion statute
which is renewed every ten years in just the
same way as the Bank Act. They do net
carry on commercial transactions, but cenduet
a savings bank business, investing the savings
in high-ciass securities. Tiiese banks were
(lesireus cf coming in under tbe clause of the
Bihl which enables the Bank cf Canada to
make boans te chartered banks against a
certain class cf securities, instead cf purchasing those securities, as they can de under
another provision. The Quebec savings banks
had been deiiberateiy exciuded from the
clause authorizing heans. though under the
Finance Act they could get such accommodatien in case cf emergency.
The chartered
banks are required te place five per cent cf
ail their depositQs with the Bank cf Canada,
and this obligation is a censiderable burden,
as we,.l. as a safeguard. No such demand was
made on the Quebc-c savngs banL--. and it

possession of such horses, vehicles, vessels or
other appliances to satisfy himself that they
were flot likely to be used contrary to the
provisions of this Act or, if a mortgagee or
lien-holder, that before becoming sucli mortgagee or lien-holder he exercised sucli care
with respect to the mortgagor or lien-giver.
By way of explanation I may say that
under paragraph a of this subsection 2 an
innocent owner of a horse, vehicle, vessel or
other appliance which has been seized because
it contained or was carrying illicit goods, may
apply to a judge, claiming that he was flot in
collusion or complicity with the offender. If
he c9n prove that, as well as what is required
by this new paragraph b, he becomes entitled
to an order that his interest be flot affected
by the seizure. A mortgagee or lien-holder
who has an interest in -the thing that has been
seized, upon proving that before becoming a
mortgagee or lien-hoider he exercised the
necessary care with respect to the mortgagor
or lien-giver, shall likewise be entitled to an
orde-r that bis interest be flot affected by the
seizure.
Paragraph b of the amcndmnent originally
passed by this House read:
that he exercised ail reasonable care in the
choice of the person permitted to obtain the
possession of such horses, vehicles. vessels or
other appliances to, satisfy himself that they
were flot likely to be used contrary to the
provisions of this Act or, if a mortgagee or
lien-holder, that the vendor to the mortgagor
or lien-giver exercised such care.
It will be scen that this original amendment read, "that he exercised ail reasonable
care in the choice of the person," and that
in the new amendment this bas been changed
to read "that he exercised ail reasonable care
in respect of the person." This is an improvement in the wording.
In the se'-ond ffiace. our original amendment provided that a rnortgagec or lienholder. claimning an interest, had to show
that the vendor of the vehicle or article used
care to see that it did flot get into the bands
of a persan likely to use it illegally. Under

committee feit disposed to provide that these
Quebec savings banks, while flot obliged to

with the Bank of Canada, or by way of
holding Bank of Canada notes, should be
required to do what the Bank of Canada
feit was reasonable, with respect to either
deposits or notes, due regard being had ta
their position, and upon doing this they
should be entitlcd to corne under this provision, as requested, so that under special
conditions such as obtain only once in a

There are many amendments to the Bilmore than I thought would be necessary after

This Bill, which was introduced in that Huse
on the 22nd of February, carne to us oly

a strong position in favour of the Bill as it
was, and I sbauld like ta give careful consideration ta the matter, cspecially the reasans

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I desire te
congratulate the Managers upon the ability
with which they defended the point of view
of this House, and upon their success in
draughting a new amendment which does not
destroy the principle for which the Senate
contended.
I should like te know whether the Bill is
now before us or before the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Before us.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We insisted
upon our amendments and sent the Bill back
to the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand it. and according te the information I
bave froa the Clerk, the Bill is before us.
Whether it has been before us continuously
from the time it was returned with the request that we agree te the position taken by
the other House, or only from the time that
thf Conference was asked for, I do not know.
At any rate it is in our hands now. It will
be sent te the other House, for the proper
motion there, as soon as the prescnt motion
is carried.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I asked the
question because I did not recollect the form
of the mes-age that came te us from the
Commons suggesting that a Conference take
place. Did the Bill accompany the message?
The lon. the SPEAKER: We sent a
messagc to the House of Commons with our
amendments and we afterwards received a
mesige ;nforming ls that the Commons did
not agre with our amendments. We insisted
upon our amendments; the Commons replied
that thev did not accept thea. and then the
Conference was proposed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We notified
the House of Commons that we insisted upon
our amendments. and the Commons sent us
a message asking for a Conference.
My
question is whether the Bill accompanied that
message.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand the position, the Bill was in our hands
when we insisted upon our amendments. Our
insistence did not transfer the measure te the
Iiglit lon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

other House, but it remained in our custody.
If the present motion carries, the Bill will
be sent te the House of Commons. In that
House a motion will be made, analogous te
the one before us, for concurrence in the
report of the Managers.
The motion was agreed te.
FARMERS' CREDITORS
ARRANGEMENT BILL
SENATE

AMENDMENT

NOT

INSISTED

UPON

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
That the Senate do not insist on their amendment te clause 17 of Bill 92, intituled an Act
to facilitate compromises and arrangements
between farmers and their creditors.
He said: As the Bill reached this House
it contained a clause-of course within the
federal jurisdiction with respect te interestthat if the mortgagor under a farm mortgage
bearing more than 7 per cent tendered the
principal with three months' interest by way
of bonus in lieu of notice, the mortgagee must
accept. the money; if Pe did not, from that
time forward the rate became 5 per cent.
The amendment made by the Senate was te
the effect that in such a case if the mortgagor
tendered the money without any notice at all,
and it was not accepted, thereafter the
mortgagee would draw only 7 per cent.
Our reason for the change seems te me
very plain. If a mortgage interest of more
than 7 per cent must upon tender go down te
5 per cent, surely a mortgage interest of 7 per
cent should on tender also go down te 5 per
cent. The man who gave a mortgage at a
-high interest rate because perhaps his land
was in a far-away district should not be in a
position te reduce his interest te 5 per cent
while the man who gave a mortgage for 7 per
cent in a btter district gets no relief. However, the other House takes the ground that
the reason of the 5 per cent provision is te
compel the wiping out of high-rate mortgages,
and that if the rate remains at 7 per cent
the mortgagee will always decline te take
his money, knowing Pc can get 7 per cent.
While this is true, it does not in the least
impair the logic of the Senate's position, that
the effect should be the same in all cases.
But inasmuch as eur amendment appears te
put this House in the position of seeking to
maintain a rate of 7 per cent as against 5 per
cent-and I say "appears" very emphatically
and very significantly-I do not think it
would be the part of wisdom for this House
te insist on the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: The reduction te
5 per cent would apply only on mortgages
over 7 per cent.

JUNE 29, 1934
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
At first sight
the Bill as it came froma the Commons wus
somewhat attractive. It was heralded throughout the country that farm loans could be
reduced to 5 per cent; but when we examined
the text we found that only loans bearing
a higher rate of interest than 7 per cent were
affected. As the Huse of Commons had
apperently approved 7 per cent as a fair
rate, we wondered why it was that ln certain
cases the rate eould be brought down to 5 per
cent. I agree with the honourable gentleman
that the Senate's view was the more logical.
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR: I d-id not gather
from the remarks of the right honourable
gentleman whether the other Ho-use insisted
on reinstating the three months' notice which.
we struck out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We reworded
the clause, striking out the three months'
notice and changing the 5 to 7 per cent. The
Commons have dechined to accede ta the
amendment and have given their reasons. If
we do nlot insist on our change, the whole
clause is resltored; which means the three
months' notice is restored.
bon. Mr. SINCLAIR: lias the right honourable gentleman the reasans given by the
Commons for non-concurrence in aur amendment?
Right lion. -Mr. MEIGREN: Yes. They
were read yesterday, but I will state them
again.
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think it was ta-day.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGliEN: The Commons
said, in effeet, that the purpose of the 5 per
cent provision was ta ensure the paying off of
mortgages carrying aver 7 per cent, and that
if the 7 per cent were retained mortgagees
would nat desire to be paid off.
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR: It was rather ta ensure acceptance by the mortgagee of his principal.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. The
honourable gentleman would not aay it was
logical. The Commons gave no reason in
respect of the three montha' notice, but I
fancy if a mortgagor's interest la reduced from
8, 9 or 10 per cent to 5 per cent, the three
months' interest in lieu of notice is probably
not a very great hardship.
bon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think we ahould
admit that the Commons are more practical
le their viewpaint. bigh rates of interest
are a burning question with agriculturiste.

When the rate goca over 7 per cent it
becomes veryj lard for the mortgagor ta
pay. Under the companian measure ta
this Bill, the ameedmeet ta the Farm
Loan Act, we are making it possible for
farmers ta borraw moeey at 01 per cent
on first mortgage. On second martgage the
rate is raised by 1 per cent. I think this is a
mistake. Only farmers with goad security can
borrow under the Farm Loan Act. I would
go further, and suggest that the farmer -paying over 61 per cent should be permitted ta
tender the principal if his martgagee will nat
accept a lower rate of interest.
bon. Mr. CALDER: To what point?
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR: I suggest 5 per
cent. Possibly this would not bring about a
reduction ta 5 per cent, but when the borrower
la given the right ta tender the principal, a
medium of negotiation is ýopened between hlm
and bis mortgagee. I do not imagine that
many farmers could borrow money mucli below
6ý per cent, but they can secure money at this
rate from the Farm Loan Board. When the
mortgagee la tendered his principal he is flkely
ta ask, "How much cheaper can you get the
money?" The mortgagor replies, "I can get
it at 6ý per cent." Then the mortgagce la
very likely ta say, "Ail right, since you can
get it at 61 per cent I will accept the same
rate." I think this will be the effeet of clause
17. It gives the farmer an opportunity ta get
his interest reduced ta a reasonable rate. I
think anything over 7 per cent is unreasonable.
lion. Mr. CALDER: It strikes me that if
the present trend continues the time will
probably came when the Government will
have ta take aver the farm boan business.
I am quite ln faveur of the principle that
agriculturists should get their money at the
very lowest possible rate of interest.
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR: bear, hear.
bon. Mr. CALDER: We are a little slow
le that regard. I know that some years ago
the farmers of France, Belgium, Holband, Denmark, Gerna.ny and other European countries
were, through indirect state assistance, getting
their money at from 3 ta 3j per cent. We
are providing for a state aystem of farma
boansg at 6j per cent.
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR: On first mortgages.
ban. Mr. CALDER: Yes. Under this Bill,
if a man has been paying 7ý, 8, 8ý or 9 per
cent, andhle tenders principal and interest, the
mortgagee mnust accept payment, or the rate

wi]i be reduced to 5 per cent. But why put
the man who happens to have borrowed bis
money, say, at 8 per cent in that position,
and flot the man who has borrowed bis money

but if you have made a fairly gond bargain
and are paying oniy 7 per cent, we wihl jet
you sfay where you are, We won't help you
ouf at ail; we wibb heip unly the other fellow."

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN,': Neither can I.

Hon. Mc. SINCLAIR: I do 00f agree with
the right honourable genflemnan. H1e is dealing
with generalities. Let us argiue on the Bill
before us and the Farrn Loan Act arnending
Bill. The Facmn Loan Board accepfs only the
very best ciass of rnorfgages.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: IJnless the state is to
prox ide the boans which agricltiiris.s require,
we must proceed carefuliy, for the mooey must
corne frorn those who have money to lend,
from loan and trust companies. We must
be careful not to drive them out of business,
because if we do it is quite possible the farmer
may find himself in a stili worse plight. In
other words, bias the Lime corne when the state
should provide nil the rnoney agriculturists
require, at a lower rate of interest than is
chargcd by boan and trust companies? I doubt
the advi.sabiify of the state ernbarking on this
business. Me ail know it is dangerous. If
farmers get their Jeans through a state systern,
eventuaily poiitics is bound f0 enter into the
business.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Part y polities.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Ycs; you cannot keep
if out. In this ciass uf legisiafion we should

farmer-and we ail wvish to heip him-we may
go ton fac and do him harm.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Is there nt very great
danger if we do ot go some distance?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Bill
stops where, if does just because if we foiiowed the bine laid down by the honourable
senafor fromn Queen's (Hon. Mc. Sinclair) we
should preftt*v soon have ýail tarin rnortgages
un our hands.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: No.
Right Hon. Mc. MEIGIIEN:
Some mortgagees would reduce the rate of interest rather
than lose their mortgages, I suppose. But if
the farmer cao get money frorn the Goveroment af 64 per cent, even though his mortgagee offers f0 reduce the intercst frorn 7 f0

SUSPENSION 0F RULES
MOTION

Right Hon. Mr. MEtOH.EN: Hlonourable
members, I beg ta move that rules 110 and
119 be suspended for the remainder of the
present session. These rules read as f ollows:
110. No petition for any private Bill is
received by the Senate after the first three
weeks of each session; nor may any private

621

Bill be presented te the Senate after the first
four weeks of each session; nor may any
report of any standing or special committee
upon a private Bill be received after the first
six weeks of each session.
This rule, rule 107, and rules 111 te 122,
both incl.uded, do net apply to buis of divorce
or te petitions for such bills, except in cases
where no special provision is hereafter made,
and which fall under rule 151.
ý19. No committee on nny private Bill
eriginating in the Senate (of which notice is
reqluired to be given), is te consider the same
until after one week's notice of the sitting of
sucli cemmittee bas been posted up in the

lobby; fer, in the case of any such Bill
originpaXing in the flouse ef Gommons, until
after twenty-four hours' like notice.
I presume there have been frequent precedents for the suspension of these rules towards
the end of the session, but on this occasion
it is asked for a special reason. There is now
before us, I think, or will be in a moment or
two, a Bill fromn the other flouse providing
for the general regulation of Joan cempanies.
Another Bill, for the purpese of incorporating
a Joan cempany, was presented te the Gemmens in the regular way, but the petition was
net submitted te this Heuse, the intention
being te submit it only if the general reguhating Bill to which I have referred went through.
That regulating Bill having been passed, those
interested now desire te submit the petition
te the Senate. It is quite true the petition
might have been submitted seener, but I am
informed by the solicitor for the company,
Mr. MacTavish, it was ýmerely threugh inadvertence that this was net dene. I see ne
reasen why the rules sheuld net be suspended
te permit a Bill which bas passed the other
flouse te ceme inte this flouse.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am quite in
accord with the heneurable gentleman in
regard te the suspension of the clause which
governs general procedure 'from day te day,
but I amn at a Jass to understand why at this
late heur the clause relating te private legielation should be suspended. I have flot quite
caught aIl the remarks of my right honourable friend. I understand that a private Bill
bas gene through the Commons, but that the
petitien for it has flot been laid before the
Senate.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes; and it
would not have corne ta this flouse but for
the passage by the flouse of Commons of a
general Bill regulating companies such as the
one which it is sought ta incorporate by this
private Bill.
The motion was agreed ta.

TELEGRAPH AND EXPRESS

JOINT OPERATION-NOTICES OF MOTIONS

On the Notices of Motions:
By Hon. Mr. Casgrain:
Pending further action by the Parliament of
Canada, in the opinion of the Senate an equal
number
of Canadian National Telegraph
officials should meet an equal number of
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company Telegraph
officials, and co-operate together by using the
saine premises and officials.
Pending further action by the Parliament of
Canada, in the opinion of the Senate an equal
number of Canadian Pacifie Express officials
should meet an equal numiber of Canadian
National Express officials, and co-operate
together by using the same premises and
officials.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: His Honour the
Speaker bas just called the two notices of
motions given by my absent colleague, the
honourable senator from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain). I am not moving the
motions, but rise simply to express my great
regret that the bills announced by the Minister of Railways for joint administration by
the two railways of the telegraphs and express
companies have not been proceeded with.
Everybody seems to be agreed that there
should be joint administration of the telegraph business and also of the express business. In fact most of the people in our large
towns and cities have been scandalized in
recent years by the duplication of premises
and officials by the separate companies, while
it was felt that in a financial sense our best
blood was oozing out through all our pores.
I believe that one of the best moves the railway companies could make would be to join
their efforts in the telegraph business, and
also in the express business. Such a move, I
believe, would meet with not a single opposing voice in this Senate or its committees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I find myself
sufficiently employed in dealing with legislation that does reach us; so I do not spend
much time in lamenting what fails to come
hcre. As to the bills referred to, I am sorry
to have to admit that I know of them only
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN,

from what I have read in the press. My
presumption is that it was decided they would
have to await the greater illumination of the
public mind, the better appreciation by our
people of what the real situation is. It may
be that in this Chamber there would be little,
if any, objection to the co-operative arrangement, or whatever it may be termed, as
provided for in the bills. But there bas been
a considerable roar in the country. There
are still those who see in every step to save
money a movement towards amalgamation.

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE- Honourable mcmbers, it will be remembered that this Bill

624

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am afraid J cannot fall into line
with the recommendation of the committee,
for these reasons: (1) There is no occupant
of the position now, and I have no information that an occupant is necessary. (2) The
Bureau for Translations Bill having been
enacted, it would seem a very inopportune
time to appoint a man to a post where at
least be would be designated as a translator.
(3) I am not aware of the amount, if any, of
the translation work to be donc, but I am
very much of the opinion that the man proposed to be appointed could not translate
two words.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I agree absolutely with the reasons given by the right
honourable gentleman for opposing concurrence in this report. Some years ago, if my
recollection serves me well, we gave the
position to the chief translator whom we were
then appointing. He had the right to corne
to the Table, but it was agreed he should
not do so. It was felt that if the Hlouse of
Commons. with 245 members, could do with
two officials at the Table, the Senate could
as well do with two. I have yet to hear one
good reason advanced for filling the position.
There may bave been times when we did not
know wbat to do with our surpluses, but teday we are trying to reduce expenses. The
other two reasons given by my right honourable friend appeal to me as being sound.
The motion was negatived.
BANK OF CANADA BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate resuimed from yesterday consideration of the report of the Standing Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 19,
an Act to incorporate the Bank of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, of the amendments made by our
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, the only one with which the Senate
cannot be said to be in complete accord is
an amendment which affects the language
section.
As originally presented to the other House
this provision read:
The form and material of the notes shall be
subject to approval by the Minister.
In Committee of the other House this was
amended to read:
Provided that notes in either the English or
the French language shall be available as
required.
The amendment carried in the Senate conmittee, by a vote of seven to six, is now
before us, and reads:
Hon. Mr. SHARPE.

Provided that each note shall be printed in
both the English and the French language.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That carried in our
committee?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In our committee, by seven to six.
Yesterday I requested that the matter
stand until to-day so that I might have an
opportunity to examine the point at issue
and acquaint myself with the circumstances
surrounding various steps which have atWe all
tended the progress of this clause.
recognize that it touches a question which is
supposed to be inflammable, or subject to
conflagration, and that there are strong feelings in different sections of this country on
both sides of the question. I must confess
that I have never been able to get under the
spell of this feeling at all, on one side or the
other. A Government, however, must take
conditions as they are; it must have concern for the honest convictions of great
masses of the population, and then seek to
direct its course so that it will not deviate
from souînd principle and will contribute most
to harmony and accord, and least to friction.
As one considers the whole history of this
subject one finds in it a most curious commentary on human nature and political
machinations in Canada. When the pact of
Confederation vas under review this question
had to be faced. The conflict of sentiment
inviolved in it had to be met in some way and
definitely resolved before we could have a
country at all. Thoe now known in veneration as the Fathers of this Dominion faced
the question bravely and resolutely. The
section of the British North America Act
ombodying the compromise agreed upon is
compact in form, exceedingly lucid, and
impossible of misunderstanding by anyone
who reads with intelligence. So lucid is it
that, so far as I know-and I am confident I
am right-not a single question raised thereunder bas ever gone to the courts of Canada.
The provision adopted stated, not that we
should have a completely bilingual system in
the sense in which it obtains in Switzerland
or some other countries, but that in this
Dominion English should be everywhere
recognized and official, but the claims of that
very considerable portion of our population
whose native language is French should be
recognized to the extent that in the province
of Quebec, where those people predominate,
their language should have absol-utely equal
rights with English in the courts and in the
Legislature. It was enacted that processes
and arguments in the courts and speeches in
the Legislature might be in one language or

JUNE 30, 1934
the other, and that the journals and records of
that Legisiature should be in bath. The Act
provided also that in this Dominion Parliament the righfs of the two) languages should be
equal-a member could speak in one or t.he
other-and, that our "J ournals and records"
should be in both languages.
That the letter of the Constitution has been
definitely and entirely followed I do not think
any serious person ini Canada will djeny. Of
course there are the more excitable, on bath
sides, who argue to the contrary; but if one
reads recent debates, or even debates ais far
back as 1907, one will find that no serious
person has ever alleged t.hat the letter of the
conmpromise has flot been completely fulflled.
There are, however, those who contend that
we are flot in fullest compliance with the spirit
of this compact unless we go the whole length
of complete bilingualiam. Wifh thaf position,
of course, I cannat agree. I do flot think
anyone could vcry seriously argue in ifs
support. If such had been the spirit and
intent, the expression of the terras of the
compact would have been entirely different.
The spirit and intent was that where Frenchspeaking people predominated-then almost
wholly in the province of Quebec--they
should have the right to use their language
in courts and legisiature, and, one rnighçt add,
to have the insignia of nationality expressed
in their own language. I do not thinc such
contention, even in its latter phase, is an
unreasonable one.
Let us now corne to the working out of
this plan. There are -those who said long
ago that inasmuch as the journals and records
of Parliament had to he in both languages,
if followed tlhat both languages should bc
used on coinage, 'postage stamps, and so
forth. No one would suggest with a sober
face that bank notes are journals and records.
When sucli a proposaI was made in 1907, for
the first time so far as I know, by definite
resolufion in the Commons, if was resisted by
the Governmenf headed by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. Sir Wilfrid himself said it did flot
follow from the compact of Confederation,
either that our bills and notes should be
printed in the two languages, or that somne
of them should be printed in English and
some in French. He expressed the view that
it was better not to make any change in this
regard, but to continue the use of the English language alone on Dominion notes. He
definitely opposed a motion to the contrary,
and of course 'his resistance prevailed.
I arn not aware of any point at which, in
the long interval sine, the issue in respect
of Dominion notes definitely emerged. In

625

this connection we mnusf rernenber that from
the day Canada became a country the Dominion Governmenit has issued what have
been known as Dominion notes of hiand.
These have always been legal tender in every
part of Canada, àncluding Quebec. As a
matter of fact, banks had no power to issue
the smaller notes, but could print only denominations of five dollars and upwards.
Smaller notes were distinctly national, and
wifhout modification, qualification, or change
of any kind, they were just as much an issue
of the nation as is an Act of Parliament,
though, of course, they were no part of records
or journals of Parliament.
One begins to wonder, therefore, how it is
that this is -the first time we have been asked
f0 issue notes in the two languages.
Indeed,
it is tihe first time we have even been asked
to issue part in one language and part in
the other. Is the Bank of Canada more
national than the nation itself? If is much
less so. Indeed, the chief crificism of this
measure is that this new Central Bank is not
national enough. The main attack made upon
if, not merely by one party in Canada, but
by two, has been that if should be a national
bank and nothing less; that while Government will have great powers of control, neyerfheless the bank is t0 be owned by private
persons and is t0 be a private bank. If this
is so, it will certainly be much less national
than the nation itself. It is only when we
corne f0 the issue of notes of.an institution
far less national than the Government of
Canada that we are faced with a dernand that
we depart from what we have done since
Confederation wifh respect to the printing of
Dominion notes by the Governent itself.
1 arn making that comment quite frankly,
hecause if goes f0 the very roof of the purpose
of those who are raising a controversy in this
country ýat fhis time. How is if, may I ask,
that this vexed question is unearthed and
pressed t0 the front now, and was not given
attention at ail when honourable gentlemen
opposite were in office and when Canada
was issuing her own notes in English alone
and circulating them. througLout the whole
Dominion?
Let us corne to the miore particular history
of the subjeet. I gave the formi in which this
clause .5tood, when it was introduced. Anyone

SENATE

But no! In the committee of the House of
Commons a question was raised and a
motion made much in the terms of the
amendment now before us, namely, that each
bill be printed in both languages. What was
the result? The amendment was defeated by
a considerable majority, some members from
the province of Quebec voting one way, and
some another.
Then the Minister of Finance moved to
substitute for the clause in its initial form,
as presented to Parliament, the following:
Provided that notes in either the English or
the French language shall be available as
required.
Vhat reception did that proposal meet with
n the committtee? It was immediately reteived with the warmest hospitality and was
supported by every member, including the
gentleman who I'ater moved against it in the
House of Commons. The proposal was carried by twenty to nothing. One can understand why it should be. If there were anything still wanting in the carrying out of the
spirit of Confederation, surely it would be
that those who use the French language,
where it was specially protected by the terms
of Confederation, should be able to use it in
respect of Dominion notes. So for the first
time in the history of Canada this was
granted. Does any lawyer in this House
think that through all these years during
which our Dominion notes have been issued
in English only, not a single one being
printed in French, or bilingually, anyone could
have gone to our courts and asked for a
mandamus to compel the Government of
Canada to issue those notes in two languages,
or rto issue part of them in one language and
part in another? Undoubtedly if it could have
been dont it would have been dont. It could
not.
But after a unanimous vote, twenty to
nothing, had been cast, reflections arose in the
minds of certain people and they thought it
just too bad to miss an opportunity which
offered such possibilities of disagroeing with
the Government and the committee, and
repentant members quickly came into the
House and moved that every note be printed
in both French and English.
The first comment I make is with regard to
the right of everyone in this Parliament to
speak English or French. Surely no one will
ver again point a finger at me as an enemy
of the French language. Surely no one will
think that I have ever endeavoured in any
way to prevent the spread of that language
wherever as well the English language is
known. Surely there is living evidence to the
tight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

contrary. In this Parliament we can speak
either language, but let every one take note
no member is compelled to speak both. In
the courts anybody can speak tither Janguage, but no one is compelled to .speak both.
The journals and records of this House are
printed in both languages. But in no journal
or record are both English and French used.
An English edition is issued for those who
want it-the larger proportion; a French
edition also is issued for those who want it.
Then comes this Bill in full accordance with
the provisions of the Act of Confederation,
and in the spirit of that Act overtaking circumstances and meeting conditions which
have developed through these years.
It
says, for the first time, "We will give you
French bills if you want them." Now, I ask
honourable members to inquire in their minds
as to the inner purpose of those who
say, "Though we expressed satisfaction and
voted unanimously for your clause, we are
springing into the ring again to see if we cannot in a struggle to get further results make
some case against you."
A question arises as to what the practical
effect will be if the amendment that came
to this House is confirmed. In our committee objection was raised that the chartered banks would be put to enormous
expense; that every teller would have to
keep on one side a pile of bills of $1, $2,
$5 and other denominations, in English, and on
his other side a similar pile, in French,
because, it was alleged, every customer who
came to a bank would have a right to demand
bills printed in either language. I did not
think it was reasonable that customers should
have such a right. It did not seem to me
that an English-speaking person anywhere in
Canada should be able to go to a chartered
bank and ask for notes in French. And of
course if he had such a right, he would also
be able to demand French notes from any
private citizen with whom he had traded a
horse or made any kind of deal whatever.
So I looked into the measure, and my conclusion is that it would not have any such
effect. This Bill applies to the Bank of
Canada and to that bank alone. rt defines
the rights of people in relation to the new
Bank of Canada, and it says that at that
bank and at every agency of that bank, at
every office of the Receiver General, any
chartered bank and any citizen shall be able
to obtain bills in English or French, as
desired. Not only is that as far as this Bill
goes, but it is as far as it tcan go. If our
legislation were intended to go farther in this
respect-and I certainly would not be agree-

that question in the negative.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN: I answered
that clearly both in the cornrittee and here.
I said that this is a Bill dealing only with
the Bank of :Canada and with the relations
of the chartered banks and the people to that
bank, but not with the relations of the people
to the chartered banks. And 1 stated that
a change would have te be made in the Bank
Act if it was desired to compel all bankers
t0 keep ýconstantly available two classes of
notes. Under this Bill the chartercd banks
and the public have the right te ask for notes
in cithier French or Englishi, as desired, frorn
the Bank of Canada or any of its agencies,
that is, any office of the Receiver General.
But the meaisure does not entitie any person
to rnake a dernand of any kind whatever
upon a chartered hank. It is the Bank Act
which governs relations between the public
and the cbartered banks.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members. 1 desire to join issue with rny right
honourahie friend on the interpretation that
hie has just given to section 24 of the Bill,
and particularly to subsection 4. He has told
us of what took place in a cornrittee of the
Houco of Cornrons. I rnight perhaps have
dernurred to his rnakinig thiat staternent,' inasrnuch as we here have no right to take
eognizance of the prDceedings of the Coinmons or any of its committees. I{owever, I
do not intend to follow him into that field,
hecause, except for what 1 have learned frorn
newspaper head-lines, I arn unaware of what
was donc witb this Bill in another place. I
shaîl rernain on our own ground, dealing with
whiat has taken place within our own
precincts, the material which bas corne frorn
our own committee, and the staternent of
rny right honourable friend.
I had taken it for granted, as I helieve
99 per cent of our people had, that after the
passing of this Bill any person could dernand
of anyv bank in Canada notes in either the
French or the Englisb language, as hie pleased,
and that his dernand would be honoured. I
subrnit that the wording of section 24 bears
out rny conclusion. I will read tbree subsections only:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend has made a remark dealing
with history, I Fihould like to tell him that
we are now creating a private bank. Hie says
that many people bave objected to the private
ownership feature. I desire to point out to
hirn that at the present tirne there are banks
in the province of Quebec which print humigual bills, but that in the course of time the
privately owned Bank of Canada will take
over the printing of bills for the whole Dominion. So if this arndment is not adopted
a right which has 'been enj oyed by banks in
the province of Quebec will be wiped out.
The arnendrnent seeks not to confer a particular privilege, but rather to preserve an
existing right.
My interpretation of clause 24, that ýanyone would be entitled to demand a note in
English or in French, as desired, at the head
office or a branch of any bank, is in accordance with the opinion generally expressed
throughout the country. I have received
from an English-speaking banker in Montreal
the following letter-, which ie dated. June 18:
Dear Senator Dandurand,
I notice by the press that the Committee on
Banking and Commerce has voted in favour
of two kinds of notes, English and French,
for the Bank of Canada, rejecting the principle
of the bilingual note.
You probably do not realize ho-w pregnant
with trouble ie such a measure, apparently so
innocent looking. Apart f romn the additional
cost of printing seven kinds of bills (1-2-5-1020-50-100) in two different languages and the
constant annoyance to which the Central Bank
would be subject, the work of sorting and
counting these bills would juet be doubled, not
only for the Central Bank but for ail the other
banke. Moreover, the English-speaking people
nught and could refuse Frenchi notes, the
French-speaking people, Englieh notes. In the
event of exhaustion of supplies or delay in
printing, the Central and other banke would
or rnight be in the unenviable position of
being onable to satiefy the legitimate requiremente of their olients.
The bilingual note would obviate all this,
and, once engraved, no one would notice the
change any more than they do the bilingual
postage stamp or railway ticket. The advantages of the bilingual bill would, arnongst others,
be the following:
1. Immense eaving in the cost of printing.
2. Do away once and for aIl with a contentioue subject not only for the Central Bank
but for the Government and alI concerned.

eafeguard againet counter3. Additional
feitere. This would be doubly difficuit.
4. Give legitirnate satief action to a large
section of the population without prejudice
te any other section.
5. Cut in haîf the work of the Central or
other banke in the handling of circulation.
Youre faithfully.
This is the view held by bankers with
whorn I have corne in contact in Montreal.
They feel they will be obliýged to have at
every wicket two sets of notes, English and
French, in order to answer the demands of
the public.

correct. Who ie the writer, please?

argument my own.
We have been told that this is not the
intention. Apparently one series only will be
issued for each comrnunity. The banks will
be the sole judges a.s to the application of
this clause. Whatever may be rny right honourable friend's interpretation or my own, I
think in practice the clause will be found
to be cumbersome and rnost annoying. The

right honouraible friend, provides that the
notes shahl only be available as and when

as the language question has been raised in
this Parliament and especially to-day in this
Bouse.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. CHAPAIS (Translation): Hanourable members of the Senate, I must first beg
the indulgence of my honourable Englishspeaking coileagues for my use af the French
I thought, perhaps, in a dehate
language.
where the question of the rights of the French
language arose, it was quite proper to make
use of my maternai tongue.
My first word must be one of congratulation to my honourable friend, the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). The
last part of his speech, where he referred s0
eloquently to the French language, where he
recalled so many historical memories and set
before our eyes the great figure -of Jacques
Cartier, was. indeed, a justification of the bill
under consideration, because such a measure,
as I hope to demonstrate, is an undeniable
recognition of the rights of our language in
this country.
The section of the bill under consideration,
section 24, raises the whole question of the
"status" of the French language in Canada.
If such be the case, it is perhaps flot out of
place to establish first on what foundation
is based the right of this language ta be
recagnized as an officiai language in the
Canadian Cunfederation.
The right to our French language is
primordially, first and last, above ail constitutions and statutes, an historical right.
The French language is official in Canada
because for one hundred and fifty years our
country wvas a French country. We referred,
a moment ago, to the name of Jacques
Cartier, the fearless navigator of St. Malo
who, four centuries ago, took possession of
this country on hehaîf of Christian and
French civilization. After a lapse of threequarters of a century, in 1608, another
Frencbman hv the name of Champlain
founded Quebec.. Agaîn, a little later, in
1642, another Frenchman by the name of
ýMaisonneuve founded Montreal. And during
one century and a haif this country of ours
was evangelized, enriched, colonized, civilized
by a galaxy of men and w«nen of the French
race and language, pioneers, aposties, warriors,
administrators and educators: Lavai, Talon,
Frontenac, Marie de l'Incarnation, Marguerite
Bourgeois; and those undaunted explorers,
Joliette, Marquette, La Salle, La Vérendrye,
who pushed their prodigious explorations to
the south, north and west, beyond the Great
Lakes, as far as the first spurs of the Rocky
Mountains. Yes, for one hundred and fifty

631

years this soul was a French country, a
country speaking the French language, bearing and handing down to history the beautiful
name of New France.

allegiance. H-owever, they neither ahdicated

Their language! The officiai use of their
language was not guaranteed, at first, by any
written text. Such a right, as I have stated,
was an historical right. Our flrst constitution
under the new regime embodied no provisions
relating to the French language. The Quebea
Act, in 1774, made no mention of it; neither
ddid the Constitutional Act of 1791. However,
in practice, common sense prevailed, and our
public documents were printed in both
languages.
We come to a gloomy period. The events
af 1837 and 1838 obscured our horizon. Our
language suffered a sad setback. The Act
of Union in 1840, by virtue of section 41,

apening of the 1849 session, Lord Elgin,
one of the most illustrious of our British
governors, delivered the speech from the
Throne in French and English.
Finally, in 1867, aur country entered a new
historical epoch. A new constitution creating
a Canadian Confederation was worked out by
our most outstanding statesmen.
And the
constitutional recognition of the French
language received a memnorable consecration.
Section 133 af the British North America
Act read as follows:
Either the English or the Frenc.h Language
mýay be used by any Persan in the Debates of

the Courts ai Quebec.
The Acts of the Parliament af Canada and
of the Legisbature of Quebec shaîl be printed

Thus under the new constitution, under the
constitution which is aur Canadian Charta,
the two languages have been placed on a
perfectly equal footing. In the Quebec Legis-

Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS (Translation): In the
Dominion sphere, the British North America
Act is entirely adhered to. The speech from
the Throne is delivered in both languages:
the English and French versions.
The
Debates are published in both languages:
the English and French Versions.
The
Journals of both Houses are published in the
two languages: the English and French
versions. The Statutes are issued in both
languages: the English and French versions.
The sessional documents are printed in the
two languages: the English and French
versions. However, there was a sphere where
this equality was not, in practice, recognized.
It was in connection with the legal currency
and Canadian bank notes. More than once
an endeavour was made to introduce the rule
of the dual languages. And here, honourable
colleagues. I wish to assure you that I harbour
no mental reservation from the political
standpoint. Long ago, I dissociated myself
from what is known as party spirit. I simply
wish to remind honourable gentlemen that, in
1907, for instance, an endeavour was made,
and again later, to stipulate that the rule of
the dual languagcs would apply to currency.
It failed.
To-day, at last, the bill under consideration
sets forth the consecration of the principle
of the dual languages applied to the legal
currency. Section 24 of the bill under consideration stipulates as follows:
The fori and material of the notes shall be
subject to approval by the Minister: Provided
that notes in either the English or French
language shall be available as required.
Faced with this text, I ask this honourable
Chamber: Is it a setback or a step forward?
Is it a retrogression or an advance? The
answer, with all the clearness of the evidence,
is thrust upon us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (Translation): I
never stated that it was a retrogression.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS (Translation): Certainly not. My honourable friend is too
intelligent to hold such views. However, it
has been stated and written.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

Referring to section 24 of the bill, I state
that this measure, after sixty-seven years of
federal rule, is a supplementary act, a new
proclamation, in a new sphere, of equality in
both languages.
I am pleased to be able to quote the words
of a man whose evidence cannot be doubted.
The following is what Mr. Henri Bourassa
stated in a recent speech:
I think the amendment as framied by the
Minister of Finance conforms strictly to the
letter of article 133 of the British North
America Act.....

It was stated that this aumendmîent of the
Minister of Finance is a step backward. Of
course. I have a very simple niind and a
liumited experience both in reading law and in
parliamentary government: but J cannot get it
into my head that the fact that this legislation
declaring for the first time that bills and money
shall be printed in French, is a backward step
in the acknowledgment of the French language.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE (Translation): How
did Mr. Bourassa vote?
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS (Translation): I refer
to Mir. Bourassa's views; they have a particular weight.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE (Translation): Which
is expressed by a vote.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS (Translation) : Now, I
hear tremulous voices-some are sincerely
moved-exclaim: "We not only request that
bank notes be printed in French; we want
bank notes printed both in English and
French.'
To this one might reply: "De
gustibus non disputandum." You prefer bank
notes bearing both French and English
inscriptions, we prefer bank notes bearing
entirely French inscriptions. With the utmost
goodwill, I cannot sec how the recognition of
the righsts of my language is more complete
with a bank note printed half in French and
half in English than with a bank note printed
entirely in French.
Perhaps, in practice, the working out of the
two-note system would create some inconvenience. That is possible. However, let us
await events; there will always be time to
remedy such a system. At present. for my
part, I only look at the principle, at the
official recognition of the rights of the French
language.
I look upon the rest as of
secondary importance, a matter of modality,
a question of shade. Shall we quarrel, shall
we fight over a matter of shade, when the
principle which is dear to us is wholly
recognized?
We are told that the French note offered
to us will have the effect of limiting its
usage to Quebec.
I cannot admit this.

JUNE 30, 1934
What! the French bank notes will be limited
to a section of Canadian territoryl Why,
in practice, that would be entirely impossible.
The moment they leave the official press,
they will take their flight across the whole
country. Who will be able to trace the
evolution and migration of bank notes from
their birth to their death? Ours, the bank
notes entirely printed in the French language,
will have the same value, the same power of
purchase, or payment, or quittance,-the
same legal value-in a word the same
"status," as the English notes. They will be
like the others, "legal tender." They will
purchase, acquire, pay and be deposited, from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the 45th
parallel to the far-flung regions of our Arctic
domain. Here are two bundles of bank
notes for an amount of $10,000 each: notes
printed in French and in English. You may
send your notes printed in French, to Halifax,
Saint John, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa,
Torouto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Vancouver and
Victoria. Everywhere your notes printed in
French will have the same face value as the
others. Parity, equality for the French
printed notes as legal tender, from one end
to the other of this country, this is what for
the first time this bill provides. That is
why I feel bound to accept it. I accept it
because it is a proclamation of the right of
French in a sphere where this right was not
yet recognized. I accept it because it places
in the Statutes of Canada's Parliament a new
assertion of the equality of the two maternal
tongues of our history and civilization. I
accept it because it amplifies the act of our
great statesmen of 1867. I accept it because
it rallies in a common adhesion all those who
have at heart the union of the two races in
this country. I accept it and request my
colleagues to accept it in order that all of
us, in leaving this Chamber, may go over
on Parliament Hill and pay our respects
before the statues of Macdonald and Cartier,
and say to them: Be content with us; we
have followed the path which you traced for
us, we have completed the work in which
you were the moet illustrious leadenrs, a work
of justice, peace and national harmonyl
Honourable memHon. Mr. PARENT:
bers, I wish merely to ask a question. Assuming that the Government is right in authorizing the Bank of Canada to print bills in either
language, some in English and some in French,
is there any reason why both languages should
not be used on the face of all bills?
At 1 o'clock the Senate took recess.

633

The Senate resumed at 3 o'clock.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable senators, from my point of view this
discussion is much ado about nothing. I
want to make it clear, though, that we are
not responsible for the introduction of the
language question. A Bill, a Government
Bill, was presented to us with the language
question in it. In a word, the question was
thrown at us.
There is no need for me to endeavour to
convince honourable members or the people
of Canada that as a student of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier I have always been a strong advocate of unity and harmony in this country.
That was his life-work. A good many years
ago I was seated with three or four others
in a Pullman car when Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
with his usual desire to secure the views of
others, joined us and asked this question:
"What will be the subject under discussion
ten years from now?" Mr. Moore, now the
member for Ontario, thought it would be
the question of the East and the West. He
was partly right. But Sir Wilfrid thought that
certain people would still be discussing the
racial question, and there would be extremists
on both sides taking strong positions. I
regret to say that this is the case, particularly
this year, when, as my leader said, we are
celebrating the laonding of Jacques Cartier in
Canada. We ought to-day to be striving for
unity rather than for discord.
This Bill was sent to us by the Government of Canada. No matter what may have
taken place elsewhere, that is the situation.
The Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce discussed the Bill without the least
rancour.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It was a very
friendly discussion. The French and the English-speaking members did not seem to be
trying to bite one another. We were really
doing what we thought was right. Is our
committee's recommendation the best solution? In my humble judgment the question
was sent to us in a very clumsy form. From
the economie standpoint, everyone will concede that the issuing of two series of notes,
one in each language, will be more expensive
than the issuing of one series in both
languages. From the standpoint of utility
my leader made it quite clear this morning
that, as I know from conversations I have
had, bankers do not favour this double series
of notes. It strikes me the method is wrong.
Now, as to the other method. I think the
right honourable gentleman referred to the
fact that we have our records printed in

SENATE
separate volumes.
But lie forgot to state
that we lie side by side in Hansard.
No
harm is done. Any person can take Hansard
and read the debates in either language
column by colum.n. I repeat, no harm is
done. The two languages mingle in Hansard
without hurt to anyone.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Is the right hionourable gentleman referring to Revised Hansard ?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am referring
to Hansard as I get it.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: As it is spoken.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
sard?

Unrevised

Han-

Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Unrevised Hansard. Have it any way you like.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: Does the right honourable senator advocate bilingual notes?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I shall fot, as
is sometimes do-ne, sit down without acquainting the honourable gentleman with my position.
I come now to the question of a bilingual
note. This question was handed to us; we
did flot introduce it. It is our duty to
decide xvhat form of note would be most
convenient and most economical, and bear
the strongest national characteristic.
It is
conceded that one series of bilingual notes
would be much cheaper than two series of
notes in different languages. Some person bas
said that the two series would make French
notes available to the French-speaking districts and English notes to the English-speaking districts. That is granted. But these
notes are not going to remain in those districts.
Once they are issued in the course of business
they will be distributed aIl over Canada, and
outside of Canada. So that will not bring
about union between the races.
In discussing unity of feeling between the
two races. it runs through my mind that we
should be very careful to do nothing and say
nothing that might lead any person even to
suspect that we are trying to keep apart
instead of endeavouring to become one people.
We must remnember that &t ýone time strong
allurements were he.ld out to those who had
recently passed from French rule to British
rule to go elsewhere. But they remained true
-they stuck loyally by -the Union Jack and
the nId British constitution. I ask honourable gentlemen if they would bave done likewise under sinilar cîrcumstanmes We cannot
forget that.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAm.

It is our duty to build up a united Canada.
Will a bilingual note convey to the world at
large that we are one people or that we axe
flot? I maintain that the printing of notes
in each language separately will tend to raise
the suspicion that we have flot been mixing
very much; that each rare is going its own
way. To my mimd it will show to the world
that the English-speaking people of Canada
are opposed to the French, inwardly at least,
and that the French-speaking people want te,
be by themselves and do flot want to be
associated with ot.her Canadians. These bank
notes should flot be French notes or English
notes; they should be Canadian notes, and in
the interest of harmony the two languages
should be used side hy side.
I have no prejudices, political or other,
in regard to this matter; I ar nfot caring
what any person thinks; but from. the national
standpoi-nt I believe it would be in the interest of Canada to have but one issue of
notes, such issue hearing both languages.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourablc members, I think I can approfich this subjcct withotit heat and without feeling. To me the
problem is a very simple one. Me have agreed
on the principle that both languages shaîl be
recognized in the printing and the circulation
of these notes. We differ in regard to detail,
but the detail of any subject is not as serbous
as the principle.
It ham been admitted, as the last speaker
said, that the printing of two series of notes
would be more expensive than the printing of
but one; and, though I knew nothing about
the letter, I was quite prepared to hear the
statement read by the honourable leader on
this side of the House from a letter written by
a bank manager in Montreal. I do not know
whether that was a Frenchi bank or an English
h,)ank,-and it would not make much difference.
The statement made in that letter was that,
s0 far as the chartered banks are eoncerned,
the two series of notes would be inconvenjent
and expensive. There is no doubt about that.
That is the view the banks take.
Having agreed on the principle, surely it is
better for us to adopt the more inexpensive
and more convenient method in carrying out
the details. Some of us think that is what we
ought to do. Others for some reason seern
to think we ought to adopt the more expensive and more inconvenient way. That,
it seems to me, is the whole situation.
When we agree on the principle that both
languages are to be recognized and that the
notes are to be published in both languages,
I can see no logical reason why we should

JUNE 30, 1934
adopt the two-series system. I arn satisfied
that if this question were left to the bank
managers and bank tellers of Canada it would
be settled in five minutes, and in the way
the Committee on Banking and Commerce
has suggested.
There is some sentiment in this matter, and
a littie heat, which is unfortunate; but the
sentiment is not ail on one side, I presume.
Hon. Mr. CAILDER: There is no heat.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: At ail events there is
heat in the atmosphere.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is a warm
day.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: There is heat in the
Chamber and outside. However, I think it
is a real pity that we cannot agree. I was
very much impressed with the statement of
the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) that if the
Bill were to go through in the formi which the
Government apparently desires, it would advertise to the world that we are divided.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why not leave things
as they are now?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In my opinion that
would be better. I think the Government
would -have been more logical if it had not
agreed to the two languages at ail. But, the
principie having been adopted, I can see no
reason in the world why each note could
not be printed in both languages.
Hon, W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
what I have to say on this question will be
very brief. As I see it, this question arises
beeause there are in this country some people
who do not want French to appear alongside
English on the Central Bank bis. I do not
helieve there are very many in this House who
would not favour the adoption of the simplest
and most econornical system-the systemi that
wouid best meet the needs of the country,
baving in view the fact that we have people
who speak French and people who speak English.
We have heard Borne very interesting and
illuminating statements from the historical
as well as the racial point of vie-w. I, as one
member of this House, have accepted them
ail in the spirit in which they were offered,
as throwing light on something that, it seems
to me, we should sornetirnes discuss. If the
discussion on matters of this kind can be
carried on in a calm, and reasonable way, I
do not see what harma cani corne of it.
Hon. Mr. HOOKEN: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I do not look at this
question frorn the language standpoint at
aIl; I consider it rather with a view to attaining the best metbod of meeting the situation.
As one who speaks the English language,
but who unfortunately does not speak French,
I rnay say that in going around the country
I have corne upon many centres of population where the Engiish and the French
peoples are living together in perfect peace
and harrnony, without any differences in
regard to reiigious matters, sehools, or other
subjects of a like character.
One cannot help being impressed by the
rnethods adopted in those comrnunities, and
the example set us by the big corporations
of the country. The Canadian Nationaýl
Railways and the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
two of the largest corporations in the world,
are large employers of labour and are interested in the welfare of the public. When
they want to informn the public about anything, what nethod do they adopt? Wherever you go you see the pool trains advertised
in the two languages. The people are advised
in the two languages how to get fromn one
place to another. The railways have adopted
what they think is the best rnethod of doing
these things.
It strikes me that the question before us
is sirnply one of method, and nothing else.
The honourable the leader on this aide of
the H-ouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) referred
to a letter that hie received from a bank
manager. For sorne ten years I worked in
a bank, and on occasion I have served the
public at the counter. Frorn this experience
I know that a banker in a community with
a mixed population will have to meet the
wishes of his customers as to the kind of
rnoney they want. I think many of the
people who are serving the public wiI4 be
inclined to curse the introduction of a measure
of this kind. The right bonourablîe leader
on the other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
said the banks would not be compelled to
pay out the money in question. True, they
will not; but they will be governed, as we
are, 'by the public, and at aIl times will have
to give to thern what they want. If the
banker does not meet the demnands of bis
customners hie will tose them.
As the right honourable the leader on the
other side bas said, Dominion notes in
denominations of ones, twos, and fours, and
in the larger denorninations for interchange
between hanks, have always -been printed in
Engiish. It rnay be quite true that there bas
been no dernand for a change, but a change
is being made now by reason of the in-cor-

636

SENATE

poration of this Central Bank, which is going
to furnish currency to the other banks. There
is also a further change. In the past the
chartered banks issued their notes in French,
in English, or bilingually, as they wished.
That privilege will be taken away from them
as the years go by.
I could sec no difficulty at ail in the twoseries system of bills but for the fact that,
as has been pointed out, the money will not
be confined to a certain area. The French bills
issued at tfhe request of a bank in a French
community w-ill flow over into the English
centres, and people who understand only English will find themselves in possession of them.
The onily knowledge they will have of the bills
will be frorm the figures on them. Frenchspeaking people who come into possession of
English bills will be in a similar position.
It is true that the question of cost enters
into this matter, but I do not think it is of
very serious consequence.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It

is the inconven-

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: If I were to disregard
the question of expense, I should advocate
a three-bill system. Then the man who
wanted a French bill could get it; the man
who wanted an English bill could also get
it; and those who wanted a practical bill that
would meet ail conditions could secure it.
Hon. H. C. HOCKEN:
Honourable
sena'tors, we were told by the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that this amendment, passed in the
Banking and Commerce Committee, was inspired by the idea in the mind of the honourable senator from Prince Edward Island
that there would be some confusion in the
handling of bills printed in accordance with
the provisions of the measure now before
us. I venture to submit to my honourable
friend the leader on the opposite side that
a simpler and more effective method of
avoiding confusion would be to follow the
constitutional practice that has prevailed in
this country ever since Confederation. This
Bill, I think, asks for a little too much. There
is neither law nor practice to support the
request for notes in both languages. No one
will argue that the Constitution provides for
anything of the kind, and ever since the
passing of the British North America Act
the practice of the Government has been to
issue ail its paper money in one language.
Why make a change? The only reason there
can be for a change is a desire to please the
sentiment of one province. Were it not that
French-speaking people wanted to have their
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

language on the currency, the notes would be
printed in English only, in strict accordance
with the Constitution. If it is felt that two
kinds of bills would lead to confusion and
dissatisfaction, I suggest that some honourable member on the opposite side should
move that the English language only be used.
That would be advocating, not a new departurc, but simply a continuance of our usual
policy.
The occasion seems to me to present a
highly appropriate opportunity for placing on
record a statement of just what are the rights
appertaining to the French language in the
Dominion of Canada.
I take honourable
members back to 1840, when the Union Act
was passed. Section 41 of that Act provided:
And be it enacted that from and after the
said reunion of the said two Provinces, ail

writs, proclamations, instruments, for summon-

ing and calling together the Legislative Council
and Legislative Assembly of the Province of
Canada and for proroguing and dissolving the
same, and ail writs of summons and election,
and ail writs and public instruments whatsoever relating to the said Legislative Council
and Legislative Assembly or either of them,
and ail returns to such writs and instruments,
and ail journals, entries, and written or printed
proceedings of what nature soever of the said
Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly
and each af them respectively, and ail written
or printed proceedings and reports of committees of the said Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly respectively, shall be in the
English language only.
That Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament, and it shows that Canada started
as an English-speaking country. Provision
was made for the use of the English language
only.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Act of 1791 before that.

But there was

Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: The Act of 1791
had nothing to do with the Dominion of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: But the Act of 1867
did.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: The Act of 1840
superseded the earlier Acts, surely.
The
French members of the united Legislature felt
that the Union Act was hard on them, for
many of them could not speak English. So
in the session of 1845 there was passed an
address to Her Majesty praying for an
amendment to permit the use of the French
language in debates and in the Journals and
Proceedings of the House. Mr. Gladstone
sent word that the Queen had been graciously
pleased to consent to the change. That is
how the French language came into use in the
Parliament of Canada, by way of a concession. Originally, as I have shown, the

respective records and journals of those houses;
and either of those languages may be used by
any. person or in any pleading or process in
or issuing from any Court .f Canada established under this Act,' and in or from ail or
any of the Courts of Quebec.
The limits of the Act are narrow. But the
Engiish-speaking province of Ontario, in trying
to show that it wants the bonne entente, has
madle very large concessions to please the
French. Yet can it be said that the bonne
entente has madle progress in the province of
Quebec when for twenty-five years there has
not been an English-speaking mayor elected
in the city of Montreal? Prior to that time
there was a plan of alternations.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Has Toronto ever had
a French-speaking mayor?
Hon. Mr. HOCREN: A man who belongs
to either party may be elected in Toronto.
It depends upon the personality and ability
of the individual. A Liberal has as good a
chance of election as a Conservative has
there.
1 agree with rny honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) th-at the circulation
of notes in both languages is likely to lead
to confusion. 1 submit to him that the only
reasonable and simple way of overcoming
this is by having ail bis of the Bank of
Canada printed in one language.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: In French, with the
fleur-de-lis on each bill.
Hon. Mr. HOOýKEN: My remarks are
being macle in the kindest spirit possible. I
concede to no one a higher appreciation than
I have of the good qualities of French Can-adians. Thcy are kindly, industrious, lovable
people.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is the chocoliste
coating on the pili.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: But, unfortunateiy,
it appears to me they are led into unwise,
courses 'by their leadiem. I arn not going to
specify any particul-ar leaders. I feel quite
sure th-at if French Canadians were left to
go along in their own way and were flot frequentiy having their language rights brought

being invadied and diestroyed, they would be
very much more easily got along with than
they are now. I should like to express kind-ly
a warning te my French Canadian friends.
They are goîng too far, and they should di&continue the agitation whieh has been going

on from 1840 to the present time. We have

it was claimed that this restriction imposed
a hardship, the Queen and ber advisers
thought it well to be generous to the minority.
The French

time.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: 1 have not looked
it up and I do not know that. Whether or
not they were a mai ority, this was an Englishspeaking country under the British Crown.
And it was so stated in the Act of Union.
What were the

Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: 1 arn not discussing

It is interesting to go back to the discussion that took place in the House of

prophetic vision he deprecated the tendency
the measure would probably have in raising
up "a permanent barrier between two portions
of the country." What is being attempted
to-day is just what he forcsaw and predicted.
You can take my word for it that neither
bilingual notes nor French notes can be circulated very far beyond the limits of the
province of Quebec without causing very
serieus protest.
The men who framed the British North
America Act were close to the proceedings of
the Union Government, and it was thought
that the Act which they framed would he

It was framed not by Sir John A. Macdonald
and George Brown only, but also by Sir Hector

assisted in the work. The limitations which
they prescribed for the use of the French
language in this Dominion have been very
far exceeded, as my honourable friend who
leads the other side will admit. Not only
Hansard and the Journais9 and records of each
House, but ail the publications of the varicus
departments as well, are printed in both
languages. That ýcertainly is a concession far
beyond the limits of the British North America
Act. I wili read clause 133, though I acarcely
need to do so, for I have no doubt that all
honourable members are familiar with it. It
provides:

friction, and in ail that time the Englishspeaking people in the varjous provinces,
notably in Quebec, have been making concessions and compromises in order that harmony
mighit prevail between the two races. What
have our French Canadian citizens ever conceded to, the English majority?
Nothing.
Even at this late date they are demanding a
privilege that would carry thejr language into
every home, every store and every pocket in
Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. -GRAHAM: Not every
pocket. There are many pockets tuat conta-in
no bank notes now.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: The English-mspeaking
citizen is the mokst tolerant person on earth.
He will compromise on almost anything for
the sake of harmony, but there is a limit
beyond whichi he will not go. And I suggest
to my honourable friends of the Frenchspeaking race that they are in danger of exceeding that. limit eow. Once it is exceeded,
there is ne more stubborni class of human
beiegs than English-speaking people. If this
language issue continues to be forced, day
after day and year after year, as it, has been
in the past, the time may corne when the
En glish-spea king s.entiment will be aroused
and Frcnch Canadýians may ]ose some of the

eow bave.
The other House was told with a great
fl'ourish, whien 1 was a me-mber of it, that
the Statute of Westminster gave Canada
equal status with Great Britain. The Prime
Minister of the day said, "I wiIl lay the
Statuite on the Table." The acting leader of
Qhe Opposition, Hon. Hughi Guthrie, replied,
-You will do nothing of the kind," te which
the Prime Minister retorted that hie would do
se on the following day. But what happened?
It was ncver laid on the Table by that Prime
Minister. Why? Because it would have given
Canada power to amond its Constitution. My
henourable friends from Quebec did net want
that, and they do net want it to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: I venture to say that
there are net many French-speaking Canadians as broad-minded as the honourable
gentleman is. The Statute of Westminster
was not laid on the Table until an amendment was made s0 that the right of Canada
te change the British North Amnerica Act
depended upon action by the Imperial Gevernment. My honourable friend knows that.
As long as that situationî continues Canada
hm. net the status of the Mother Country nior
Hon. Mr. HOOKEN

of New Zealand or Australia. Canada te that
extent is still a colony and will remain se
wvhile we have net power te amend the Constitution.
I am net a prephet ner the son of a prophet,
but 1 say this. If the Parliament of Canada
hiad power te amond the Constitution, as it
should have had under the Statute of Westminster, there would be trouble awaiting my
French Canadian friends that they do not
apprehieed at the present time. This Country
is net always geing te be governed by the
provinces of Ontaneo and Quebec. It neyer
bas been governed very much by Ontario.
There is a great West growing up, sentiment is
changing, and public opinion will make us
keep close to the limit in matters suchi as this.
The rigbit honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) Isys on the
Gov ernment responsibility for this Bill. He
Ns perfectly correct. Why did the Gevernment agree te the printing of bank notes in
French? I do net think there cau. be any
doubt, as te, the reasen.
The pressure of
French influence brought the Government te
that peint. I think the Government showed
an cxceediegly generous-to my mind a tee
generous-spirit. What did the Government
get in roture? Opposition in the House and
in committee. Our own committec amended
the Bill and tnied te force throughi something
that could net get threugh the other House.
In what interest Ivas that donc? Net in the
interest of harmony. Net te premote a bonne
entente. It was purcly and solely in the interest of a movement in the province of
Quebec, where the people are stirred up te a
fronzy wvheever they are led te believe their
r)rivileges are threatenod. They forget they
enjoy three or four times as much as they
wvould if the Act of Confederation were strictly
enforced. I de net think there is any doubt
about that.
I gathered frem the remarks of the right
honourable gentleman from Eganville that
there is geing te be a great deal of dissatisfaction and confusion in regard te, the two
series of hank buis, that some of the French
series wvill circulate in ail the provinces and
in the United States, that some may even
reachi England, and that a bad im.pression will
ho created.
I gathered that my honourable
friend frem King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) would
prefer a ene-language bank note. In view of
this sentiment from such an influential quarter,
I venture te meve:
Thiat ail the words after the word "M'ýinister"
in suhsection 4 of setion 24 bc struck ouît and
that the following words be substituted: "and

I do not know whether I can get an honourable member with sufficient nerve to second
this amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: IJnder the rules

There is no constitutional issue at stake
in this case. It has been admitte-d elsewhere,
and it is admitted bere, that it is a question
of cboosing the best metbod of applying a
principle aýcoepted by aIL 1 enjoyed the
speech by the rigbt honourable leader of the
flouse much more-may I say it candidly?than that just delivered. The rigbt honourable gentleman's speech sbowed a broad vision of what should be considered the proper
Canadian outlook. I noticed bis allusion to
past political events in wbicb hie was a very
important actor, and tbe heat and emotion
with which hie said bie hoped in the future
no one would again point a finger at him and
acouse him of being antagonistic to French
Canadians.
I arn confident bis expression of feeling was
inspired by a sincere conviction that we must
ahl work for national unity. But I regret
tbat my rigbt honourable friend to-day let
pass a unique opportunity to redeem himself
in the eyes of those who were accusing him
yesterday.
Several honourable memnbers have referred
to the attitude adopted by a former leader
of the Liberal party, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. I
would remind the House that times have
cbanged, and tbjere are to-day in Quebec and
outside-for I may inform. my honourable
friend from Toronto that Quebec is considered as an Indian Reserve only by narrowminded people-almoet a -million loyal
Frenech-speaking Canadian citizens. Even in
Toronto tihere are a good many, but as yet
they have been unasble te influence my hionourable fTiend and bis friends.
Right Hon. Mr. GR.AHAM: There neyer
wae a French-speaking mayor of Toronto?

639

Hon. Mr. LACA&SE: No. It may be
true that Montrent has flot elected an English-speaking mayor for several years, but it
is equally true that two English-speaking
men important in the political hisbory of this
country, niamely, Mr. Baldwin and Mr.
Stewart, who were once lef t without a seat in
Ontario and in Alberta respectively, were
generously accommodated in Rimou»ki and
Argenteuil by French-speaking electors. On
one occasion I proposed. to a friend of mine
in Toronto, belonging to another party, that
his city might well repeat that generous gesture in favour of prominent French-speaking
Tories repeatedly defeated in Quebec, but hie
doubted very mu.ch whether it was possible.
No public man can ignore the fact that
to-day there is a very strong feeling among
Freneh-speaking Canadians, a feeling which
nothing can stop, against real or apparent
encroachments upon their rights and privileges
wbich have been-to use an expression fallen
from the lips of my honourable fricnd from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Chapais)-consecrated
by natural right and historical tradition. Some
people in Toronto may believe that the
supreme triumph of the British cause was
the hanging of the patriots of 1837. That
apparen'tly, in their minds, is where political
history begins in the ne*w world. Well, it
may be necesry to remind tbem once in a
while that thbe hîstory of Canada goes back
to its discovery by Jacques Cartier-whicb
event will be solemnly commemoratcd this
year ini Quebec and tbroughout Canada. As
1 say, there is a strong feeling ainongst al
Frencb-speaking Canadians against any encroachment on their rights and privileges, s0
much so that a few days ago four members
of another flouse took the decisive step of
secedîng from their party when this Bill was
under discussion tihere. They t.ook that
definite course because they know they are
responsible to the eleetors, who before long
wilI be called upon to renew their confidence
in them, and because they are fully aware of
the strong sentiment obtaining in their respective constituencies in this regard.
We have been told îndlirectly by the right
honourable leader of this House that this
opposition to the Bill is a political move.
The word "political" was flot used by him,
and again I admnire the right honourable gentleman's ability to express his mind *without
This

adToitness is flot due to fear, for I recognize
him as one of the most fearleoe of our
political leaders. In spite of strong denials,
however, I believe that my honourable friende
opposite will show in a moment or two, by
their unanimous voting, who are the real

640

SENATE

partisans in this case. The issue was forced
upon us more or less, and we have to face it.
One other point I wish to bring forward is
that other parts of the Empire have already
donc what we are advocating to-day without
endangering the security of the British Crown.
Not only in Canada but in other self-governing Dominions there are bilingual, excise
stamps, and, notwithstanding, the King bas
been just as healthy as he ever was. Then
we already have also postage stamps telling
the people of this country and of other
nations the true complexion, from a racial
standpoint, of the population of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN:
those who have microscopes.

Only

to

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: In honour of the
celebrations which will commemorate the discovery of this country by Jacques Cartier, the
Postmaster General is issuing a new stamp
which-to the scandal of my honourable
friend from Toronto-will be in French and
English. I am very sorry for him, but in
my capacity as a physician I freely offer the
stimulant which in due course may be necessary to revive him.
Studying other interesting precedents, I
find that in 1827 there was bilingual money
in this country. It is inscribed, "Bank token
-one penny." In 1855 there was issued by
Molson's Bank, from Toronto too-what a
scandal!--money bearing an inscription in
French. In spite of the French words, it was
usually honouredl
Do we not also find that in South Africa
and in the Irish Frce State they have
bilingual money? True, those two countries
havc each-what we have not as yet-a
distinctive national flag. But let us hope this
will come some day.
My right honourable friend said that a
bilingual bank note would look somewhat
awkward. That is a very light argument,
especially from such a source, and not up
to the usual standard of my right honourable
friend's arguments. I hold in my hand the
only $5 bill I have left. It is issued by the
Banque Canadienne Nationale.
It is in
French and has a very artistic appearance.
One may observe that there is plenty of
room for the duplicate heading in English.
I was reliably informed a day or two ago,
and I give the information to the House
for what it is worth-I admit it is hearsay
evidence, something which certainly would
not be admitted in a court of law-that the
plates and engraving for bilingual money had
already been prepared before the question
came up in the other House. As I say, I
give the information for what it is worth.
lion. Mr. LACASSE.

If such is the fact, I should like to know
who or what was responsible for changing the
plans.
As I have already said, this is not a constitutional issue. I agree that from the
standpoint of French-speaking Canadians the
issuing of two sets of notes is a big gain.
Hon. Mr. HOCKEN: A big gain?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I admit that, although it deprives the two French banks, La
Banque Provinciale du 'Canada and La
Banque Canadienne Nationale, of the privilege which they have hitherto enjoyed of
issuing notes in French. They will be deprived of the right to issue any notes at
all.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: When?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Not for ten
years.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: By that time probably the feeling to which I have referred will
be strong enough to hasten a definite solution
of the problem.
Now, honourable senators, I wish to stress
one more point, which is suggested to me by
the surroundings in which I live. I happen
to live in a district which geographically is
American. The territory to the north as well
as to the south of the county of Essex is
American; so geographically, and in many
other ways as well, we are more or less
Americanized. That is probably the reason
why I feel that we should not lose this new
opportunity to affirm that we are citizens of
a different and distinctive nation. I say we
should not allow this occasion to pass without making an effort to stimulate national
pride by stamping on our bank notes something that is characteristically Canadian.
I appeal to my honourable colleagues in this
House not on the grounds of constitutionality,
but for the sake of peace and justiceHon. Mr. HOCKEN: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I think I understand
the word "peace," but it would seem that the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hocken) bas his own personal, original and
exclusive way of interpreting the meaning of
English words. For the sake of peace, justice,
harmony, convenience, common sense, broadmindedness, courtesy and economy, I advocate
the issuing of bilingual bank notes, and I
intend to vote in favour of the amendment
recommended by the Banking and Commerce
Committee.
Coming back to the honourable senator from
Grandville, I may say, before taking my seat,
that I do not think it is was quite fair of

JUNE 30, 1934
him to bolster up his case by a quotation from
the remarks of an eminent public man, when
that very man took exactly the same ground
that we are now taking. I invited the honourable gentleman to inform this House how
that particular gentleman had voted, but he
declined my invitation because he knew the
answer would weaken his case.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I have triedsuccessfully, I believe-to treat this rather
ticklish subject as quietly and as coolly as
possible, in order to avoid scandalizing honourable gentlemen, especially those who do not
remember the days of their youth, when they
were active and impetuous. If I have
trampled on forbidden ground, I apologize
with all due respect to those who are sincere
in not sharing my views.
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, I have neither the vocal capacity nor the
oratorical ability of the previous speaker; nor
have I the historical knowledge possessed by
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hocken). I may say in passing, however,
that I believe I am more tolerant than either
of those honourable gentlemen, for I have
reached a time of life when I have learned
to take the middle ground in some matters.
I do this not because of a lack of back-bone,
but because it is a matter of common sense.
We are here for only a short time, and I think
we shall make more progress if we do not
make mountains out of mole hills.
The honourable senator from Toronto spoke
of the provision contained in the Bill as "the
limit," from which I should infer that he
meant it was the last straw that was going to
break the camel's back. I do not so regard
it. Furthermore, I think he is farther from
the opinion of his own leader than he is from
that of the speaker who bas preceded me.
It bas been said that this amendment proposed by our committee is the idea of the
honourable member from Prince Edward Island. There is more than one senator from
that province. I may say to the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hocken)
that I agree with the honourable senator from
Prince Edward Island, as, I believe, many
others do, and I am convinced that our view
will receive more support than that of the
honourable gentleman from Toronto. The remark as to one honourable member from
Prince Edward Island receiving more consideration than anybody else is in my opinion
entirely uncalled for.
There is another matter in respect of which
I think the honourable senator from Toronto
went a little too far. Since when bas the

641

Senate of Canada been precluded from
exercising its prerogative as a revising body?
Why should the honourable gentleman say a
minority are trying to force through something rejected by the other House? The
questions that come before us are discussed
on their merits.
It bas been suggested that the question we
are discussing is a political one. I may say that
so far as I am concerned it is not. I have
been much impressed by some of the arguments
advanced, particularly that of the honourable
senator from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster).
I happen to have some investments, and now
and again I receive financial statements. These
statements are in both French and Englisha very sensible and economical plan-for the
French-speaking stockholder and the Englishspeaking stockholder are both able to understand them. I have never seen the two
versions issued on separate sheets.
I should like to inquire as to one or two
points that have not been touched upon in
this discussion. Is there any obligation imposed on a bank teller to ask a customer what
kind of money he wants, or is he at liberty to
hand out either? The Bill says the form and
material of the notes shall be subject ta
approval by the Minister, but nothing is said
about the size of the notes. In the United
States bills of different denominations are of
different sizes. Is the size of our notes to be
dealt with by those directing the affairs of the
new bank?
I am learning a little French from bilingual
bank notes. I have a note of La Banque
Canadienne Nationale.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Give me one.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: It is a bigger
note than the one referred to by the previous
speaker (Hon. Mr. Lacasse). On the left side
of my note there appear the words "will pay
to bearer on demand," and on the right side
the words "paiera au porteur sur demande."
I also have a note of La Banque Provinciale.
The two languages appear on this bill in positions which are the reverse of those on the
other bill. On the left side I find "Dix dollars à demande au porteur," and on the right
side, "Ten dollars on demand to bearer." That
money is just as good to me as if it were
printed entirely in French or English, or in
Norwegian, Scotch or any other language.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
I will take it.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I have also a
Canadian quarter. This bears an inscription
in Latin.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is bilingual.

amples as these, I bave corne te tbe conclusion
that I must support the amendjment.
One argument made by tbc right bonourable
gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Meigben) impressed me. Ho asked why this question bad
not cerne up ycars age, and wby this agitation now. I think the logioal answer is that
nover before bas there existcd, in regard te
banking matters, exactly the same situation
that prevails in tbis country to-day. Four
years age the Bank of Canada was net even
rnooted. This idea came frorn the left, wbere
they are werking- in close harmony. I may
say that tbe mai ority of ban.kers do net think
a Central Bank is necessary. Nevertheless,
the new order is, I believe, one reasen why
this question bas becomne acute at the present
time. It is my intention te vote for the
arnendment.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD:
te the amendment?

The amendment

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Net the arnendment te the amendment. I arn going te vote
fer the proposal to put the French language
oe one side cf the bill witli the Englishi. The
principal thing te ho eonsidered is wbether
we can get cash for these notes. The rnajerity
of people do net care a heot about anything
else. If yeu issue two series of bilis you are
going te muitiply the werk of every officiai
of every bank. There is one tbing that has
net yet been deflnitcly settled. I have net
yet heard whether this amendrnent is ultra
vires or net. If it is intra vires, I arn in
faveur of it.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, one remark of the honourable gentleman wbe bas just taken bis seat causes me
te say a word. I arn inclined to look at this
whole question from the practical standpeint.
I realize that there is a good deai of sentiment in conneetion with the prohlem, and
naturaliy se. The same question bas been
raised many times in the histery of Canada,
and though we rnay try to shut our eyes te
the fact, we cannot deny tbat it bas a political
significance as well. However, I arn net going te consider tbe sentimental or the political
side of the subjeet.
I have istened attentive]y te tbe debate
in ouler te discover what is the practicai sirIe
of the probiern, because, after al], that is the
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

essential feature. As far as 1 can see, only
one point bas been raised, namely the bother
or inconvenience and the expense that will
be involved if we adopt the proposai coming
from the other Huse. I arn sure that every
member in the House, if he stops to consider
for a moment, wiIl agree that the question of
what language or how many languages shall
appear on our buis is of very littie interest
to the people of Canada as a whole. Tbe
honourable gentleman who bas just taken bis
seat says tbat the language on tbe bill does
not make any difference to him; tbat be
woul(1 accept good money if it were Norwegian, Scotch, Italian or French. Is flot tbat
the position taken by tbe average man in tbe
s treet? Do you suppose lie bothers about
this language question at ail? In my opinion
it does not concern bim in tbe slightest degree.
Almost seventy years have passed since
Confederation and 1 have neyer beard of any
real agitation in any part of tbis country,
not even the province of Quebec, to bave the
French language on bank bis. If there bad
been anytbing of that kind I think I sbould
have heard of it. I and tbousands like me
are not in the ieast concerned as to what is
on our money so long as it is good. Tbat is
the main point. If I go to Europe and travel
about, I accept the Englisb pound, the Frencb
franc or tbe currency of Italy or Belgiurn,
s0 long as it is good.
I grant tbat the cost of engraving two plates
to print bills in two different languages would
be greater tban the cost cf one plate for hilingual bis, but tbe difference would be inYou can print hundreds of
finitcsimal.
thousands, yes, millions of bis frorn one
plate; so I tbink we may eliminate the question of expense.
Now let us corne to the actual ivorking out
of the proposai te provide bills in eitber
language for those wbo want tbern. I ar n ot
going hack to tbe days of tbe old Moison's
Bank, hecause conditions existing then may
have been different. ýSince 1867 Canada has
iiad contrul of its currency and wte bave
printcd our Dominion notes only in English.
But tbat is only haîf tbe story. If there bas
been any demnand by tbe people of Canada
for bills in any language other tban Englisb,
wby bas tbat demand not been voiced by the
banks? We bave had in tbis country as many
as thirty banks, all doing business with tbe
people in tbe province of Quebec. Tbe Bank
of Montreal, one of tbe strongest in Canada,
wvitb headquarters in the city of Montreal,
doing business there from year te year, has
nover issued one note printed in French or
Frencb and Englisb. Wby is this? If there
was a demand on the part of any large section

SJUNE 30, 1934
of the people of the province of Quebec for
buis printed in French, or in the two languages,
does anybody think the banks would flot have
met that demand?
As I have said, this question is flot practical
at ail, but sentimental and semi-political. If
it were flot for the sentimental and political
factors it would flot be before us. From a
purely practical business standpoint there is
no necessity for doing anything different froco
what bas been done in the past.
Now, how is this plan going to work out?
If the law as it bas corne from the other House
stands, what will happen? If I were a banker
in the city of Montreal I should have the right
to go to the Central Bank and ask for currency printed in either the French or the
English language. What should I do? Should
I ask for both kinds? I doubt it very much.
The banks wiIl carry currency which, with very
minor exceptions, will be the same as they
have carried for the last seventy years. In
remote places where there are flot the same
facilities as exist in the cities, but only small
brandi banks dealing entirely with French
Canadian people-there are a great many such
communities in the province of Quebec-I
dare say ail these branch banks will be supplied with French notes. The people of the
province of Quebec are familiar wîth the
bilingual situation, but out West the condition
is entirely different. While it is true that between La *ke Superior and the Pacifie Coast
there are a number of French settlements,
the people out there, as a whole, are not
aocustomed to the use of bilingual documents.
If notes printed in French were circulated
in the West we should have a repetition of
the same kind of thing that took place prior
to the last election and became an issue in
a large section of Saskatchewan. As I understand it, money orders printed in the French
language were sent out to, residents of entirely
English-speaking communities. The greatest
care should have been exercised in a matter
of that kind, but it was not, and a grave
inistake was made, from. which considerable
trouble resulted.
My point is that in the practical working
out of the law the managers of banks wilI
have the authority to go to the Bank of Canada and ask for notes in English or Frenclh,
as desired. These bankers will know their
own business and no difficulty whatever will
be encountered in the matter. I think that
the amount of French notes dTifting into
English-speaking communities, and English
notes into French-speaking communities, wilI
be so srnall as to be easily taken care of.

Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable senators,
I arn possibly the cause of this debate,
because the arnendment for bilingual notes
was moved by me in the Banking and Commerce Committee. The discussion we have
had here would seem to indicate a belief in
somne quarters that in brînging this matter to
the attention of my colleagues I was actuated
by prejudice and partisan motives. I want to
assure honourable members that no sentiment
of the kind influenced me to tie slightest
degree. When I rnoved my amendment I
had in mmnd only some representations that
had been made to me, to, the effeet that it
would be more economical to have ail our
bank notes printed in both languages than to
have some in Eng]ish alone and others in
French alone. I acted in good faith, and was
convinced, as I still amn, that it would ha in
the best interest of Canada that ail the notes
of this new bank should be bilingual.
I think the case for the amendment bas
been well expressed by honourable members
on this side who have spoken, and 1 do flot
desire to add anything in that connection.
But I should like again to assure honourable
members that I arn n guilty of any of the
improper motives that have heen irnputed.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
the Rigit Hon. Senator Graham, seconded by
Hon. Senator Little, that the arnendments
made by the Committee on Banking and
Commerce to Bill 19, an Act to incorporate
tie Bank of Canada, be concurred in.
In amendment it is moved by the Right
Hon. Senator Meighen, seconded by Hon.
Senator Calder, that the committee's amendment No. 9 be flot concurred in. Arnendment No. 9 reads:
Page 12, lines 35, 36 and 37. For the words
"Provided that notes in either the English or
the French language sh ail be available as
required" substitute, "Provided thait each note

That is to say, if interest upon securities of

another, and whereas the new set bas not

not yet an Act at all.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is not even

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is applicable
generally as adding this class of investment.
I was certainly under the impression that the
Act of this session repealed and re-enacted
with revisions the Act of 1932; but I must
have been wrong.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. This
Bill can have effect only when the Dominion
Elections Act of 1934 passes, because it simply
authorizes a continuation of the Representation Act for the purpose of enabling returning
officers to be appointed under the authority
of the Dominion Elections Act of 1934.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 116, an Act to amend

The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: This Bill is very brief, and I may
have to crave the help of honourable senators
in having the House understand exactly its
effect. The object is to amend the Representation Act of 1933-what we call the Redistribution Act. The single section reads:
1. Section seven of The Representation Act,
1933. is amended by adding at the end thereof
the following:"Provided that for the purpose only of
authorizing and enabling the appointment
pursuant to the Dominion Elections Act, 1934,
of returning officers. this Act shall be dermed
to be now in force."
The Representation Act of 1933 is deemed to
be still in force for the purpose of enabling
the appointment of returning officers pursuant
to the Dominion Elections Act of 1934.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 124, an Act to amend
the Customs Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: This Bill amends the Customs
Act. Section 1 repeals the amendment of the
second session of 1930 as to fair market
value.
Section 2 provides:
The Governor in Council, whenever it is
deemed expedient to do so, may order that
excise duties and excise taxes in whole or in
part shall be d'isregarded in estimating the
value for duty of goods of any kind imported
into Canada from any specified country and
may vary or rescind such order.
I cannot conceive of any objection to this
amendment, for it simply permits a reduction of valuation for duty purposes.
Section 3 provides for the repeal of paragrapli a of section 225 and substitutes therefor the following:
(a) by any contrivance gains access to
bonded goods in a railway car, or to goods in
a railway car, upon which goods the Customs
duties have not been paid; or breaks or aids

PENSION BILL
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 127, an
Act to amend the Pension Act.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
On section 1-Pension Act amended:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is this
Bill about?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Pensions.
The Huse understands that none of these
bis arc of major importance; they are mainly consequential. This also is a short Bill.
It provides:
Section three of the Pension Act, chapter
one hundred and fifty-seven of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, as enacted by section
two of chsapter for-ty-five of the Staitutes of
1932-33, is amended by inserting the following
subsection immediately after subsection three
thereof:

shall, notwithstanding any statute to the contrary, be paid his salary as a judge and a per
diem allowance of fifteen dollars."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Has this any
relation to the rumour that the present Chairman of the Pension Commission is likely Io
be appointed Chief Electoral Officer? It
would seem to be paving the way for him to
resign.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I do not
know anything about the rumour, I know
nothing about its relations. It is quite apparent that the retirement of the present
chairman is contemplated; and inasmuch as
only a judge may be appointed in his stead,
the Bill is another evidence of the Government's exalted sense of duty rather than its
desire to serve its friends.
My right bonHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend has spoken of Colonel Thompson resigning the chairmanship of the commission.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
chairman, I understand.

He is still

I have occaHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sionally heard criticism of the chairman by
people who thought he was somewhat stern
in protecting the Canadian treasury against
applicants who came before the Commission.
I may say that for a number of years I had
relations with the Commission and its chairman, Colonel Thompson, in connection with
amendments made to the Pension Act, and I
found Colonel Thompson to be one of the
m.ost zealous officers I met during the time
I occupied the position which my right honourable friend now fills. I have always felt
that his qualities especially fitted him for his
position, and I should be sorry to see him displaced by someone who would have less
courage than he has displayed during his
career as chairman of the board.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have a
great deal of sympathy with the view expressed by my honourable friend. I hope I
did not intimate that Colonel Thompson was
being removed. I do not believe that is the
case. I should be very sorry if it were so.
Not only has Colonel Thompson had a distinguished career as a soldier, and held an
honoured place in the record of great names
in Canada, but in guarding the Canadian
treasurv he has been, I think, one of the
most zealous officials we have ever known.
He has frequently been attacked from all
sides of politics. I think I can say that over
a period of fifteen years he has maintained
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

an unbrokenly consistent record of refusing
every single thing I ever asked of him.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think that
for a decade and a half I have had nothing
but a stern and unwavering negative to every
appeal. Nevertheless, I regard Colonel Thompson very highly. I know he is actuated by
nothing but the sternest rectitude, and I can
accept a negative from him better than I can
from most officials. It may be that continued attacks have altered his disposition.
I hope not. I do not know the facts relating
to his retention or retirement.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I had the
pleasure of presiding over the Department of
Pensions for many months, as, indeed, I
have had the pleasure of presiding over almost
every department of the Government at one
time or another.
Colonel Thompson is not the austere, distant
man one might take him to be; on the contrary, he is a most genial man. When a
friend came to us to enlist our help we were
all inclined to think we had a case, and it
was necessary for Colonel Thompson to
become a second edition of himself, a sterner
man than he is by nature, in order to enforce the law. If the Law wa.s unfair, the
fault was ours, not that of Colonel Thompson.
I sometimes thought he was a little too strict;
but one must remember that a weak man in
his position would have allowed our pension
expenditures to reach proportions far in excess
of the legal requirements.
I used to enjoy sitting down and being
abused by Colonel ThompsonSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: -and abusing
him in return. as well as I could. I may say
that I alwav had the utmost confidence that
Colonel Thompson would go as far as the
law permitted him, but not one inch farther.
If he has never acquiesced in any requests of
the right honourable leader of this House, I
may consider that fact as an additional qualification for the other office that we expect him
to take.
Section 1 was agreed to.

DOMINION FRANCHISE BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 101, an Act respecting the
Franchise of Electors at Elections of Members
of the House of Commons.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, three purposes are served by the present Dominion
Elections Act: first, it determines the qualification of voters; secondly, it provides for the
preparation of voters' lists of all qualified
electors; and thirdly, it provides for the holding of elections and for the making of returns
of the persons elected. If honourable members will keep these three purposes in mind
they will find it easier to follow the disposition
that has been made of that Act by this
Rigit lion. Mr. MEIGHEN.

measure and the companion measure, Bill 115,
an Act respecting the Election of Members
of 'the House of Commons.
The objects of the Franchise Bill correspond
to the first two of the purposes served by the
present Dominion Elections Act, regarding
qualification of voters and preparation of
voters' lists. The Elections Bill contains
provision for the holding of elections and the
making of returns.
The Franchise Bill is divided into six parts.
Part I is of general application and provides for the administration of the Act
under a Commissioner. Under the scheme
there is to be a registrar for each of the
245 electoral districts. It is appropriate to
men'tion here that the Chief Electoral Officer,
whose title will hereafter be the Commissioner,
will no longer appoint returning officers. These
appointments are to be made by the Governor
in Council.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Not permanently, but for
each election?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, for each
election.
The Governor in Council can
appoint and rescind.
The registrars in the various divisions are
to make out the electoral lists. Consequently
there will be 245 lists made up and superintended by those registrars, who will follow two
processes. The first process will be used only
once, for the making of a basic list. In the
past iýt was the custom to use the old provincial lists, but hereafter, under Part II of
the Bill, a basic list is to be made. Part III
provides for the second process, that is, the
annual revision of .this basic list. The lists
will be printed once a year, at Ottawa, and
are to be closed lists. The idea of the change
is that a shorter period of time shall intervene
between dissolution and an election. Instead
of ten to twelve weeks being required, as in
the past, four weeks will be ample.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is it intended
that the type for those lists shall remain
standing from year to year?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am unable
to answer that detail, but I presume it would.
The lists are to be made under the registrars or enumerators very much as is now
done, except that the registrar for the electoral district will revise the lists in urban
polling divisions and the enumerator will
prepare the lists in rural districts, the major
feature being that an appeal may be made
from both the registrar and the enumerator
to a judge.
Part III, which provides for the annual
revision of lists, is the very eserncr of the

JUNE 30, 1934
Bill. For each electoral division there is to
be one registrar who will travel, and will sit
as a court of revision at places previously
advertised, and at set times. He will conduct
all the processes of adding, amending and
striking off of names.
Part IV provides for appeals to a judge
from an enumerator in a rural district and
a registrar in an urban district.
Part V deals with offences and penalties,
and Part VI has to do with a variety of
matters, such as printing of lists, fees and
expenses of officers, franking of franchise
materials, the report to Parliament and the
time when the Act shall come into force.
This review covers only the Franchise Bill.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Does this Bill
deal with the troublesome question that I
hear bas been discussed, as to making it
compulsory for the applicant for registration
to affix his signature?
I think that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
requirement -has been eliminated.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I thought it
had been amended, but not eliminated.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sorry
I cannot answer the question. I thought that
this House would not be interested in more
than an outline of the main scheme, since
elections have not the same interest as they
used to have for honourable members. We
should like to be acquainted with the principal features, of course, as with those of any
other measure that we are asked to pass.
While I am on my feet, perhaps I may
explain the Dominion Elections Bill.
Which is not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
before us now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. But
what I have to say about it will facilitate
the understanding of the Franchise Bill. The
Elections Bill, as I have already intimated,
is the re-enactment, with changes, of that
portion of the old Dominion Elections Act
not covered by the Franchise Bill. That is
the portion having to do with the holding of
elections and the making of returns. There
are two major changes. The first is the one
I mentioned a few moments ago, namely,
that in future the appointment of returning
officers shall be made by the Governor in
Council instead of by the Chief Electoral
Officer, or Commissioner, as that official is
to be known henceforth. The other change
bas to do with the holding of advance polls,
which from now on are to be open to a
wider range of voters, including fishermen,
miners, sailors and lumbermen. I have here
a concordance showing what happens to every

651

one of the sections on transfer from the old
measure to the present Bill, and I think I
can answer any detail within reasonable time.
I feel that a sufficient explanation of both
measures lias been given to enable honourable
members to form a general and accurate idea
of the changes made by the other House in
the election machinery of our country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the right
honourable gentleman explain why it bas been
deemed advisable to transfer the authority for
the appointment of returning officers from the
Chief Electoral Officer to the Governor in
Council? I may say that when the present
law was passed I thought it was fair to the
parties contending for election, because it removed the appointments from the political
field and placed them in the hands of a permanent official, whose duty it would be to
select men of perhaps greater independence
than would be possessed by appointees of
the Governor in Council. The habit in former
times had been for the Government to appoint
its own friends, but I think that the Chief
Electoral Officer was given authority to select
returning officers from among adherents to
either party. I do not know whether the
present law has worked out to the satisaction of the candidates in the various ridings,
but it contains an element of fairness which
I consider commendable.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I had to do
with the passing of that law, and I, too,
thought it was commendable. I make no pretence of repeating what was said in the other
House, for I do not know what happened
there, but to my knowledge there has been
no press comment in strong opposition to this
feature. My own view is that no opposition
lias been expressed. The Chief Electoral
Officer necessarily resides in Ottawa. He knows
nothing at all about the constituencies of
Yale, or Cariboo, or Cape Breton, for example.
While he is not subject to the interest of candidates, a great variety of influences are
brought to bear on him and he is not in a
position to measure the value of any of them.
He is unaware whether any recommendations
made to him have an honest origin, and he
usually acts without determining this point.
Indeed it would take him an impossible time
to make such decision with respect to the 245
constituencies. That is my criticism of the
present law. And, as I believe that no party
has opposed the change, I think it is probably
a wise one. I ran in several elections in the
days when returning officers were appointed
by the Governor in Council, and I got not a
bit more advantage when the nominations for
these appointments were made by a Gov-

when they were made by a Government which
I opposed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
state what I deemn to be the attitude of this
Chamber on such bis as these. I have aiways
felt that legisiation of this kind, concerning
principally the lieuse of Counions, shouid
bc interfered with by the 'Senate only if there
seemed to have been a gross abuse of mai ority
action in the ether lieuse. We should endeavour to maintain an even scale as between

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second roading of the Bill.
He said: Honourahie members, I think this
is the onhy Bill as to, which we can make any
substantial complaint with respect te the other
House. The Bill is quite extensive and deals
with about a score of clauses of the Crirninal
Code. It was introducod in the other House
on the 20th of June. Ton days have been consurned in its consideration, and we are expected te deal with it in the course of a few
minutes. This is entirely unfair. I know it is
impossible for a Government te bring down
alI its legislation in the earhy part of the sessien. As circumstances devehop it is nocessary te introduce particular measures towards
the end of the session, and there is ne way of
avoiding it. The bills we dealt with this afterneon were bills of that character. But this
Bill is different, and I know of no reason why
it could net have roachcd us a considerable
time bofore this.
I can make a pretty full explanation of the
measure and thon leave its disposition with
honourable members.

Hon. Mr. COTE: I think there is more
merit to the amendment than the honourable
gentleman states. Previous relation with the
accused is part of the same offence. He should
not be acquitted on the plea that he has committed the same offence before with the same
person. The two offences really constitute
one crime.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The indictment has to eertify when the offence was
committed. The indictment says John Jones
on such a date seduced such and such a girl
of previously chaste character.
Had the
authorities known of the first offence the
accused would have been charged with it.
John Jones replies that a year and a half

Hon. Mr. PARENT: It comes down to a
question of fact. The womnan in question
has or bas not done this or that, and it is
a question of fact whether she is of previously ehaste character. If in fact she is not of
previously chaste character, why declare her
to be so?

Section 10 was agreed to.

That is exactly what it

Hon. Mr. PARENT: The words here are:
Proof that a girl has on previous occasions
had illicit connection with the accused shall not
be deemed to be evidence that she was not of
previously chaste character.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It is "illicit connection
with the accused." That is turpitude of the
accused, and he should not be allowed to set
that up as a defence.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: A girl can accuse
a man, and the fact that she has on previous
occasions had illicit connection with him shall
not be deemed to be evidence that she was
not of previously chaste aharacter. For the
protection of our citizens generally, of both
sexes, I think that such a law should not be
passed.
I believe my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend does not realize that this
is to prevent the accused from pleading that
she was of previously unchaste character because of having had illicit connection with
him on previous occasions. I am not inclined
to be much disturbed by this section.
Hon. Mr. FAUTEUX: But no distinction
is made as to whether the previous occasions
were two days or two years prior to the date
of the act charged. A girl could easily blackmail a man, if we passed such a section.
Surely if a girl has been having illicit relations
with the accused for two years she should
be deemed to have given sufficient consent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand the matter, consent does not enter
into the case at all. I have not the Act
before me, but I feel the crime provided

against is one in which consent is not a factor.

had nat been chaste with him a year before?

'On section 11-used, reconditioned or rebuilt goods or things:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This section
reads:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
who sells, exposes or has in his possession for
sale, or who advertises for sale any goods or
things which have been used, reconditioned,
rebuilt or remade, and which bear the duly
registered trade mark or the trade name of any
other person who owns or is entitled to use
such trade mark or trade name, unless full
disclosure is made that such goods or things
have been so used, reconditioned, rebuilt or
remade for sale, and that they are not then
in the condition in whieh they were originally
made or produced.
I presume this is to cover such a case as
where a man takes a Ford car which is out
of condition, but which bears a trade name
or trade mark, puts it into shape by the use
of considerable materials and sells it, still
bearing the Ford name, without disclosing
that the car is not in the condition in which
it was originally produced.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Should that

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not to recondition it, but to offer it as a genuine
article of that name when it is nothing of
the kind.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about turning
back the speedometer on a car to show ten or
fifteen thousand miles when as a matter of
fact the car has gone perhaps thirty-five
thousand miles? I am told that sort of thing
is a common practice.
Rfght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am told it
is. However, that is covered by the present

law, for any man who does such a thing makes
a false representation, and on conviction may
be sent to the penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: It is a case of
caveat emptor-let the buyer beware.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is an argument against buyihg second-hand cars. Is
there any danger that in yielding to repre-

sentations which are received from time to
time we may go too far and make the criminal
law apply to cases that should be nothing
more than causes of action for damages?

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That danger
always exists. But in the complicated age in
which we live the development of machines
and the increasing complexity of social life
make it necessary to keep creating new
classifications of crimes. If this were not done
there would be a great deal of wrongdoing for
which no punishment was provided. The
cases covered by this amendment come very
near to those which ought to be subjects
of civil action.
Section Il was agreed to.
On section 12-intimidation:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Section 501
of the Code covers the case of intimidation
by violence, threats, and so on, and provides
thnt the offence shall be punishable on indictment or on summary conviction at the
option of the accused. There is no reason
whv it should be at the option of the accused,
and the amendment, which is inserted at the
roquest of the At.torney-General of Manitoba,
strikes out that option.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is a further
amedment in my copy of the Bill. This copy
is not marked, but it bears a typewritten slip
indicating that after the word "thereof" at the
end of section 12 of the Bill the following is
to be added:
-and
by adding. at the end thereof, the
following as paragraph g:
(g) Attending at or near or approaching to
sncb ibouse or other place as aforesaid. in order
nerely to obtain or communicate information,
shall not be deemed a watching or besetting
within the meaning of this section.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
copy which the honourable senator bas must
be the correct one, for that further amendment
is initialled, although it did not appear in
my copy.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is that further
amendment applicable to strikes?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not know.
I suggest that we pass to the next clause, and
in the meantime I shall be glad if the honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Coté) would look into the question.

On section 13-applicant remains in custody
or gives recognizance or makes deposit in
court:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The change
here is very unimportant. It bas to do with
cases in which there is an appeal. The appellant shall, "in cases in which imprisonment in
default of payment is not directed, enter into
a recognizance in form fifty-one with two
sufficient sureties, as hereinbefore set out, or"

It permits the recognizance as an option to

Section 13 was agreed to.
On section 14-right of appeal not waived:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is one
of the few sections that make better provision for the liberty of the subject. It says:
No p rson shill be deeined to waive the
right of appeal provided by the next preceding
section merely by paying the fine imposed on
bis conviction without in any way indicating
an intention to appeal or reserving the right
to appeal; and the rigbt to appeal so provided
payment and

failure to indicate such intention or reservation, be decIned to continue up to the expira-

tion of the time, or any extension thereof, for
filing the notice bereinbefore required.
Section 14 was agreed to.

On section 15--right of appeal to continue
to expiration of time for filing notice:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All that is
done here is to add British Columbia to the
list of provinces in tihe section. It reads as
follows:
When any person is charged, in the provinces of Alberta. British Columbia, Manitoba
and Saskatchewan before a police magistrateThen it goes on to specify the proper judicial
offieors in the other provinces.

On section 16-certain charges disposed of
in summary way in the Yukon:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would
appear that a complete copy was sent over

wrong copy.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This section
is intended to simplify criminal procedure in
the Yukon Territory by providing a summary
trial in cases where the magistrate feels that it
would meet the ends of justice.

accrues, and the officer who appears for the
corporation can make the election.
Section 18 was agreed Vo.
On section 19)-Attorney-General of Quebec,

If it appears that a jury is nlot going Vo be
necessary at an assize, and it is known at a
certain time before the assise that there will
be no jury, a man who is entitled Vo a trial

not intended Vo apply anywhere but in the

venue.

Hon. Mr. PARENT: I bave not quite
sized tsp the remarks of the right lionourable
gentleman, and I should like to know if he
ias any suggestion te make with reference
to section 18.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I explained
section 18. It is merely te give a corporation
the right of election as to the mode of trial,
the same as a person would have.
As te section 19, 1 should be abl.iged if the
honourable gentleman would. look at it carefully, because I arn not familiar with the
situation in bis province. We will pass over
19, and I shall explain 20.

may, in the manner bereinbefore provided,
obtain, at any time after the decision net to
summon the jury bas been rendered, an order
that the trial be proceeded with ini some other
district within the eaid province named by the
court or judge.
This bas ail corne so suddenly I should like
the right hionourable gentleman to give us a
few words of explanation. He ba-s said the
explanation .might corne from a lawyer of the
province of Quebec. There are some on the
other side of the House, and also on this
side.
The OHMIRMAN: I understood the right
hon-ourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) to ask that section 19 be suspended until the honouraible member fromn
Kennebec (Hon. MT. Parent) had time to
look inito it.
The right honHon. Mr. DANDUR.AND:
ourable gentleman suggested thiat a Quebec
barrister couid explain Vhs more easily tban
he could. My honourable friend will find
that. the only addition is the following:
-at any time after the decision not to sumamon
the jury bas been rendered.
This seems quite logical. So long as there
has heen no order Vo dispense wit-h a termn of
the criminal court in a district, the aocused
is subject to that juirisdiction; but the moment the Attorney-General decides that no
court is to be held at that place the acoused
bas the riglit to move to have bis trial transferred.
Hon. Mr. CALDER- Othe-rwise he would
stay in jail without a trial.
Section 19 was agreed to.
On section 20-definition of "ýcourt" in sections 1081, 1082, and 1083:

Section 22 was agreed to.
On section 23-coming into force:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Section 23
is the section which calls into force on the
first day of September, 1934, all the provisions
of this Bill except section 3, which shall come
into effect on proclamation by the Governor
in Council. Section 3 is the one which makes
compulsory the registration of everyone who
bas in his possession a revolver or a pistol.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Would the right
honourable gentleman tell me if there is any
distinction in the Act between pistols and
rifles, or between shot and ball and shells,
or whether anybody who is in possession of a
pistol or a rifle is liable ta a fine? The
reason I ask is that there are pistols and
rifles intended for the shooting of plover and
small game, and which do not cause bodily
harm.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am afraid
I cannot give a very satisfactory answer to
that question. The honourable gentleman
will find "offensive weapon" defined in the
Code. It has to be a weapon that will do
harm.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Bodily harm?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
pistol that cannot do bodily harm.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
We lack
the experience of the honourable gentleman
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), who
last year drew a very fine distinction between
revolvers and pistols. I think the weapons
referred to must be capable of doing bodily
harm.
Section 23 was agreed ta.
On section 12-intimidation (reconsidered):
Hon. Mr. COTE: Section 12 contains an
amendment to section 501 of the Criminal
Code, which deals with intimidation. Undoubtedly it would apply to picketing, which
might amount to intimidation. Section 501
provides that everyone is guilty of an offence
who does certain things wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to compelling any other person to abstain from doing
anything which be bas a lawful right to do,
or to do anything from which be bas a lawful
right to abstain. There is given a list of acts
which may be regarded as intimidation, and
this includes paragraph f, which is as follows:
-besets
or watches the house or other place
where such other person resides or work's, or
carries on business or happens to be.
That wording is rather broad, and I am told
it bas been decided by one or two judges
that merely calling at a house-not watching
it, but merely calling there-might come
under paragraph f. This, of course, would
be going a little too far, and it is prorposed
to amend it by adding subsection g.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
adopted in the Commons?

Has that been

Hon. Mr. COTE: Oh, yes. It reads:
Attending at or near or approaching to such
house or other place as aforesaid, in order
ierely to obtain or communicate information,
shall not be deemed a watching or besetting
within the meaning of this section.
This reduces the scope of the section in what
I think is a very reasonable manner. My own
interpretation of the section as it stands in
the Act would exclude the mere attending at
or near the house-that is, just making one
call-to find out who is working there. Under
the amendment it is made clear that this is
not an offence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Or any number of calls for that purpose would not be
an offence.

JUNE 30, 1934
The clause
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
which has just been read by the honourable
gentleman was in the Act many years ago.
In 1887 I sat for a month in the place of
a magistrate in the city of Montreal. At that
time the question of picketing came before
me. When a strike is declared men are
appointed by the strikers to, stand by and
inform people who would go to work, or
strike-breakers, that a strike is in progress.
This clause covered that situation. But years
ago, when it was found desirable to consult
that clause, it could not be found. Nobody
kneýw what had become of it. It had been
dropped in the revision of the Statutes. Now
it is coming back.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I thinlc you will
find that in Montreal, and also in Toronto,
if I arn not mistaken, there was a case in
which a judge or magistrate held that a picket
who was simply maintaining a kindly supervision over what was going on had violated
paragraph f of section 501. This new paragraph g is for the purpose of giving the
strikers' pickct the right to maintain proper
and reasonable supervision for bis own protection and for the protection of the rights
of those who are on strike.
Section 12 was agreed to.

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill contains the procedure for the conduct of elections?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I explained the two major changes; the others are
trivial.
I have more
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
than once advocated in this Chamber three
important reforms to insure the orderly conduct of elections without any large expenditure
of money, namely: compulsory voting; the
appointment of permanent returning officers
in cities of 50,000 population and over, to
keep the voters' lists up to date; and that
the day after nomination every elector be
notified where hie is to vote.
This Bill does not provide for compulsory
voting, but it does provide that the votera'
lists be kept up to date and that the day
after nomination the returning officer shaîl
notify the elector of bis voting booth. This
is a great improvement.
In the city of Montreal its more than 200,000
municipal electors are notified by card, in due
time after nomination, of the place where they
are to vote. The card implies that the recipient is on the voters' list. This system
simplifies matters and saves candidates a great
deal of worry and expense.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My honourable friend
lias touchied on one large expenditure in the
conduet of an election. The other is the
preparation of the lists. When an election is
in sight hoth parties must spend an enormous
amount of money on this work. Under the
proposed legislation the Government provides
two men at each polling division to represent
each of the major parties. This provision,
together with the notification to the electors
of where they are to vote, will save candidates
very heavy expense.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCX: The Bill provides
that the Government shall notify each voter
where he is to vote.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
officers.

No; the returning

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Very well. That
would be very satisfactory if we could be
assured it would be done, but I will wager that
a good many votera will flot receive advice
as to where they are to vote. Both parties will
rely on the official notice going forward. Later
on, who is going to prove that the notice was
sent out, if for some reason it did not reach
the voter?

660

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Any returning officer
who does not carry out his duties is subject to
very severe penalties.
Hon. Mr..MURDOCK: That may be. But
is there any possibility of proving that notices
to Jim Sykes and Tom Jones did go forward
as provided for in the Act, although those men
may say they never received such notices and
consequently did not know where to vote?
My judgment is that the responsibility should
have been left with the party organizations.
They should be sufficientiy interested to see
that the voters are notified. It seems to me
there may be a great deal more dissatisfaction
under the new procedure than we have had
under the old.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We cannot go further
than impose severe penalties on any electoral
officer who does not do his duty. I am not
going to say that what the honourable gentleman fears may not prevail to a very limited
extent, but I believe the great majority of
those in charge of elections will carry out the
law. We are getting further and further away
from the old election ideas. The new provision is accepted as a very marked advance
in election law. It dSos not prevent a candidate from sending out notices to the electors.
I admit that it

looks the proper thing to do. I hope it works
ont as the honourable gentleman believes it
will, but I fear it may not.
The Hon. Mr. SPEAKER:
is on the third reading.

The question

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
we have gone over the Franchise Bill. I am
referring to it by way of explanation as to
what the House may decide to do with this
Bill. These Bills have been reprinted since
being passed in another place. Here is a
reprint of the Franchise Bill. I do not know
how many other copies are available. This
is the House copy that was transmitted with
the message to us, and the other copies are
identical except that they are not initialed
by the Clerk of the Commons. I think it
can be safely said that the members of the
Commons are intensely interested in the provisions of this Bill and desirous that they
should be correctly stated. During the recess the legal gentleman who had charge of
drafting af the neasure, and I,made a careful
check to see whether all the amendments
made to the Bill last night or earlier were

inserted.
exceptions which are not at all material.
It is a question whether, when we come to
deal with this Bill, we should put in these
minor amendments that have been left out.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

As to the Elections Bill, probably twenty
minutes would be time enough for us to go
through it and see whether there is any major
omission. From the discussions I have had
with the lawyer who prepared this Bill, I feel
sure that there is none.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I understand that the
honourable gentleman has in his hands several
copies of a Bill which bas not been distributed.
It would be more generous on his part to
give us copies.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My honourable friend
bas misunderstood me. I have here simply
the House copy, and if I bad any other I
should be only too glad to pass it to the honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would my honourable friend state what Bill lie is referring to?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Bill 101, an Act
respecting the Franchise of Electors at Elections of Members of the House of Commons.
I am quite aware that we were dealing with
another Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
ask the honourable gentleman if the errors to
which he refers were with respect to amendments made by the other House.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Let me outline one of
them. The right honourable Leader of the
Opposition in another place moved an amendment to paragraph xii of clause 4, on page 5,
dealing with the Doukhobor vote in British
Columbia. I remember his making the amendment. With a view to greater clarity he moved
that the words "in the province of British
Columbia" be transferred from the position
in which they now appear in that paragraph
to the beginning of the paragraph. The
amendment was agreed to by the Minister of
Justice and carried, but it is not in here.
There bas been a slip on the part of someone who had charge of the Bill. Should we
not nake the necessary change here? If the
leader of the Opposition in the other place
finds that the amendment is missing, will he
not be disappointed?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think we
should go into Committee of the Whole and
at least put the Bill into the form in which the
Commons intended it to be. I suggest that
the motion now before the House be withdrawn, and move that we go into Committee
on Bill 101, the Franchise BiLil. I hope that
while we are considering this measure the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) will endeavour to give the same
valuable service with respect to the Elections
Bill as he as given on this one.

DOMINION FRANCHISE BILL
CONSIDERED IN OOMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Cornmittee on Bill 101, an
Act respecting the Franchise of Electors at
Elections of Members of the Bouse of Cornmons.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
The CHAIRM AN: Honourable members,
in view of the Iength of this Bill and the
staternent that was made before 6 o'clock by
the honourable gentleman frorn DeLorimier
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that it was not the
praotice for the Senate ta give minute
scrutiny ta bis regarding ele-otions, I suggest
that instead of taking the sections one after
another we consider only those ta which
attention is drawn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: Our real purpose in going inta Comrnittee is noV ta make
changes of aur awn in the Bill. I do noV
know that we ought ta make such changes
unless there appeared ta be something
seriously wrang. Our intention now is rather
ta amend the measure sa as ta make it conform with what the Bouse of Commons intended it ta be. That is ta say, we should
correct such slips as have occurred-. The flrst
is:
Page 5, sub-subclause xii of subelause c, lines
32 and 33: transpose the words "'in the province
of British Columbia" ta the flrst part of sub.
subelause xii.
As the clause naw stands it reads:
Every Doukhobor persan in the province of
British Columbia, andi every descendant of any
such persanand sa an. Apparently the Leader of the
Oppositian in another place thaught it would
read better in this way:
In the province of British Columbia every
Doukhobor persan, andi every descendant of any
such persan,
If I may express an opinian, I think he i
right. I mave that that arnendrant be madie.
The motion was agreed to.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: On further
consideration, I arn inclined to leave this as
it is, "qualifled person." I do not like to

Hlon. Mr. MURDOOK: I think the words
"qualified person" are right. If a change were
made, hall a dozen aliens might show up and

Right Hlon. Mr. MEIGRIEN: I think the
honourable senator is right. I will not move
that amendment.
The next is:

The wording is "as in the good judgment of

cannot be assumed that the judgment was
good.
The motion was agreed to.

amendment is:

word "polling" and before "division."
It should read "-polling division" and not

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Suppose there is not
a post office in the polling division?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One would
more lîkely be in a division than in a subdivision.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: The last part of
the paragraph reads:
or, if there is no post office therein, then in
the post office nearest thereto.
The motion was agreed to.
The Bill, as amended, was reported.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the third tirne, and passed.
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE BILLS
BURDEN OF PROOF

Right Hon. Mr. METOHEN: I mave that
we now adjourn during pleasure; but it will
be necessary for us to meet again bel ore
prorogation takes place. There are some bills
to corne from the other Bouse, and we have
before us a number of bis to which we have
not given final consideration.

662

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: Honourable members, I express regret that I was not here
prior to the evening sitting. I am told that
Bill 124, an Act to amend the Customs Act,
was passed here to-day. May I ask the right
honourable leader, or some other senator who
is a lawyer, if it is not a principle of British
justice that an accused person is deemed innocent until proved guilty? .I have always
understood that to be sa, and therefore I
should like some explanation with regard to
the last clause of this Bill, paragraph 2 of new
section 218A. The first paragraph provides
that no person shall make any signals for
the purpose of giving notice to anyone on
board a smuggling ship, and the second paragraph, which has to do with onus of proof,
reads:
If any person be charged with having made
or caused to be made, or for aiding or assisting in naking, any such signal aforesaid, the
burden of proof that sueh signal so charged
as having been made with intent and for the
purpose of giving such notice as aforesaid was
not made with such intent and for sueh purpose, shall be upon the defendant against whom
such charge is made.
I am heartily in sympathy with the objects
of this Bill, as I understand them, but it
seems to me that the paragraph I have just
read is a reversal of the principle of British
justice.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think I can
state clearly wby the paragraph is justified. It
is one of the cardinal principles of British
law that the subject is innocent until proven
guilty. But the paragraph to which the honourable gentleman refers has to do with the
procedure to prove guilt. At this point may
I say to my honourable friend that in our
Criminal Code, as in the British and American
codes, there are similar dispositions of the
burden of proof in certain cases. What is the
case intended to be covered here? A man is
charged with signalling from the shore, by
radio or otherwise, a vessel engaged in smuggling, with intent to advance a smuggling operation. The Crown, first of all, has to prove
that signals were made to the vessel. That
might not be difficult, but if the paragraph
were changed to read as the honourable gentleman thinks it should read, it would be necessary to prove what was in the man's mindthat he signalled with intent to belp that
smuggling vessel. Proof of that would be impossible. His intent may appear to have been
wrongfuh, but he may have had an honest
motive. It having been proved that ho did
the signalling, the law says that the onus
is now on him to show what his intent was.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

This shifts the onus from the Crown, which in
such a case could not possibly discharge it, to
the party who can discharge it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I see the point
more clearly. Now I wish to ask the right
honourable gentleman ta define the difference
between this question and the one we were
considering a few days ago, when the right
honourable gentleman was insistent that the
owner of an automobile shoul.d be entitled
to get back possession of his car if it was
seized.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In that case
I was on the other si-de. In faaet, as I explained to the Committee, I had bad some
experience of persons being persecuted. That
question did not concern our Criminal Code,
but had to do with a man who under the
present law forfeits his automobile if it has
been seized after being used by someone else
in an effort to defeat the revenue statutes.
The owner of the car, or a person who had
a mortgage on it, however innocent he may
have been, or however -careful ta see that the
machine did not get into the hands of someone likely to use it for illegal purposes, vas
penalized by losing his property. I objected
to that law. The history of revenue laws is
such that stringent enactments are almost
universally made to assist the authorities in
enforcement. My submission was tha.t if the
owner of such an automobile, not accused of
an offence, established beifore a judge that
he was innocent, that he had not been in
collusion with the offender, that before letting
his car out he had taken reasonable action
to see that the person to whom he was letting it was not likely to use it for illegal
purposes; or if a mortgagee or lien-holder
proved that before taking the mortgage or
note he had made all reasonable inquiries to
assure iimself that the mortgagor or liengiver was not likely to use the machine
illegally; tlen such owner, mortgagec or lienholder should be entitled to his property. The
Senate accepted my amendment to that
effect, as the other House later did. In that
case, as in the one referred to by the honourable senator, I was in favour of the full onus
being on the subject, but I felt that a man
who had obeyed the law to the extent I have
indicated should not forfeit his property
merely because, against his wish, someone else
committed a crime.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The onus of proof
is on the subject in both cases.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
establish that he is innocent.

And he must

Tbe amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: A very large section
was added to the Bill, but tbere was a failure
to give the numbers of tbe sections of the
Act, and of the forms. The figure 42 wili

members, the adjournment until this morning was requested in the belief that the business of the other bouse was concluding on

Royal Assent and formaI prorogation. I regret the misunderstanding. The other House
meets at Il o'clock. As conceivably it may
not conclude its business before 1 o'clock, I
think our proper course is to adjourn until
3 o'clock.
BUSINESS 0F PARLIAMENT
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: bonourable menabers, may 1 be permitted a few minutes only
in which to register a protest respecting the
system that now obtains, and bas obtained for
too long a period? I refer to, the order in
which legislation is prepared and presented to
the two branches of Parliament. I believe
that the greater blame rests on the other
bouse. We have beard a lot about reforma-

JULY 3, 1934
ing the Senate, but the circumstances now are
such that it would appear the House of Cornmons needs reform.
In the atternpts to, prorogue Parliament we
have seen undue delay and many annoying
incidents, resulting in added expense to the
country, as well as expense and inconvenience
to about 310) members. These experiences
are becoming too frequent, and surely some
method can be devised that will preclude their
repetition.
The King's representative is requested by
tbe head of tbe Government to be in readiness
at an approximate time to dissolve Parliament. To many, especially those in th
crowded galleries, it means m.uch te, see the
brilliant pageant, the officers of the militia,
naval and air forces, ail resplendent in their
uniforms, accompanying His Excellency. To
say the least, it is sornewhat discourteous that
lis Excellency should have to be informed
there has been a false alarm; but when this
is repeated several times in a few bours it
can only be described as a contretemps.
The right honourable gentleman who leads
this House spoke very plainly a few days ago
respecting the annoying delays occasioned by
the translation vendetta between officiais of
the two Houses, and we bave hopes that
bis strongly expressed resentment will result
ini a better situation in that particular branch
of the public service.
This matter of prorogation should, I believe,
be considered of at least equal importance,
and I respectfully submit to the right honourable gentleman that he might suggest to
the Prime Minister wben tbe legislative programme is being prepared tbat Bis likely to
be more or less contentious sbould be introduced during the early part of tbe session, and
minor legisiation should follow. If this suggestion were adopted, bene4lt would, I arn
sure, accrue to the country and to ail concerned. As the custom. is now, members corne
here early in the year fresh and ready for
business, but work is carried on in a desultory
manner and much time is lost. Then, wben
the warrn weather approaches and members
becorne restless and impatient, the most important bis are presented for their consideration during extra and longer sittings.
It would appear therefore that if the usual
order were reversed better consideration could
be given to legislation, with the resuit that
time, money and energy would be utilized to
the best advantage.
We witness to-day, by the slim attendance
in both FTouses, what the present system involves. Many mernbers left on late trains
Saturday night, believing that Parliarnent

665

would be prorogued before midnigbt. This
situation was accentuated by the fact that the
Chief Accountant of the other Hlouse had
paid the members the balance of their indemnities. But the Chief Accountant of the
Senate-he rnust be Scotch I-is cautious. Re
is waiting until everything is over before
issuing cheques.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, while not wishing to be in any way
derogatory of the honourable member's complaint, 1 may intimate that I have heard
sometbing of the same nature before. This
is to be said of what be has suggested, that
it bas already taken cffect, but has not proved
a complete cure.
It is true that towarcLs the end of sessions~
this one notably, others as well-exasperating
and unexpected delays occur, accompanied by
confusion, if not discourtesy as respects the
representative of the Throne. Nevertheless,
this is inherent in the liberties we have. These
liberties would have to be curtailed, and curtailed in a manfler whîcb I know would bring
the stoutest and most persistent opposition,
before anything in the nature of contrai could
be obtained.
We havee now flot two parties, but, speaking
rougbly, four. This involves a certain lack
of discipline or of such control on the part
of a few members as was possible under the
bi-party system. This is one ingredient of
the situation.
Another ingredient is this. Our closure system is a slow working devine.. It doem not
enable ail the legislative work to be accomplished within a certain time. 1 know of no
way .to, cure the, situation of which the hon aurable gentleman complaina, and make sure it
is cured, exoept such a system as has been
found essential in France, in the United States,
and in England. 1 arn not saying that -the
difficultiee we encoirnter are such that the
time has corne wihen the more drastic procedure would be justified.
As to bringing down contenitibus measurea
carlier, that cure was wholly applied this
session, if ever, and I bhink it can be said it
was applied also asat session. Nat only conte-ntious measures, but t.hose that had any
prospect of beting oontenetous, were introdueed
at an early otage. The Bank of Canada Bül
came ýto us st, but it waas introduced hn the
other House early in February. The difficulty
is, there are not less than twenty-three banking
and financial experts in the Commons, wibile
we 'have only one. This is a great truth wbidh
the honourable member should fully compre-

00

SENATE

hend. With so many experts, four menths
proved little enough time in which te dispose
of the Bill.
The only Bill which might bave been introduced sooner was not contentious at all-the
measure to amend the Criminal Code. It
was introduced into the other House nearly
three weeks ago. Why it took so long to reach
us I do not know.
If the honourable gentleman's influence in
his party is at all commensurate with his
capacity, I hope he will do something with
members in another Chamber to see to it that
more expedition is given to the legislative
business of the country.
At 1 o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at 3 p.m.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, there is still no business for this
House to deal with, nor any intimation as
to when the final business of Parliament will
be presented. I move that we adjourn during
pleasure, to meet when the bell is rung, at
the call of His Honour the Speaker. I anticipate that we are not likely to be called before
six; but as to .that I cannot speak with certainty.

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After sorne time the sitting was resumed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Honourable

rnembers, all I can say, on 'the best informa-

tion obtainable, is that it will be necessary for
us to conveine at 8 o'clock. I believe that the
seemingly inevitable discussion in the other
House shows signs of terminating.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I am compelled to move again for
an adjournment during pleasure. I understand there are still some items of the Supply
Bill to pass the other House. I will make no
statement as to when they may be passed.
Never having been in the newspaper profession, I am not a success at gathering news.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There is no
scoop in that.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting was resumed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that he had .received a communication
from the Secretary to the Governor General,
acquainting him that His Excellency the
Governor ýGeneral would proceed to the
Senate Chamber this day at 10 p.m. for the
purpose of proroguing the present session of
Parliament.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 129, an Act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for the

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE moved the
second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I suppose I might become greatly
disliked if I were to proceed to criticize the
contents of this Bill. The reason I desist
is not that the measure does not deserve
criticism.
This is probably the last opportunity I
shall have to speak at this session, and I want
to say it is my prognostication that before
this House meets again we shall bave had
a general election. When we finish this evening honourable members, of the Senate will
not be nearly as nervous as hbonourable members of another place, who have to go home
and report progress- or the opposite.
The passing of supply is principally, though
not altogether, the prerogative of the House
of Commons. Particularly at this late hour, I
have no objection to raise to the giving of
second reading to this Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE moved the third

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
After which His Excellency the Governor
General was pleased to close the Fifth Session
of the Seventeenth Parliament of the Dominion
of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I desire to express my appreciation of the
careful attention you have given to the various
measures submitted to you for consideration
during the present session, and to congratulate
you upon the extent and importance of the
legislation enacted which vitally affects the
economic and social life of Canada. It is a
source of profound satisfaction that the
improvement in economic conditions in Canada
which was in evidence when you commenced your
This
sessional labours is still apparent.
is reflected in substantially
improvement
volume
increased national revenues, a greater
of inter-Empi-re as well as foreign trade and a
betterment in employment conditions throughout
the country. Our favourable trade balances
have strengthened our external exchange
position and our national credit was never
higher. The enactment of legisl.ation incorporating the Bank of Canada to operate as a
Central Bank will permit of the exercise of
a sound measure of public control over credit
and currency in the interests of the economic
life of the nation and will secure to Canada
a greater measure of freedom in the exchange
markets of the world. The decennial revision
of the Bank Act has been completed, and
necessary amendments made to improve our
monetary and banking institutions.
Legislation bas been enacted to improve the
methods and practices of the marketing of
natural produets. I express the confident hope
that this legislation will provide the means by
which the producers of primary commodities in
this country may exercise over the marketing
of their products a degree of regulative control
which will inure to the benefit alike of producer and consumer. The Companies Act will
provide greater security for investors in Canadian enterprises. The decline in world commodity
prices experienced in past years has borne
heavily on the producers of primary products,
and the farming population bas been faced
with a great burden of debt. By means of
the legislation which has been enacted speedy
adjustments withou't expense to the farmers
may be made with creditors, and authority has
been granted to the Canadian Farm Loan
Board to extend its operations so as to provide
the farmer with additional capital by advances
on farm mortgages and also by providing intermediate credit. Under the provisions of the
Statute of Westminster legislation bas been
enaeted to make effective extra4erritorially
the laws of Canada relating to navigation and
shipping. The provision for the construction
of publie works and undertakings widely
distributed throughout the country will, it is
believed, further serve to stimulate economie
recovery by providing emplcyment in various
lines of activity.
Among other important measures passed
were: an Act to provide for the Franchise of
Electors at Elections to the House of Commons,

SENATE
an Act respecting the Bureau for Translations,
a consolidation of the Excise Act, measures
affecting fruit, dairy, live stock and live stock
products industries, and an Act affecting Canadian and British insurance companies.
The exploratory work of the Committee on
Price Spreads and Mass Buying bas awakened
publie conscience to the need of preventing
unfair trade practices and exploitation of
workers and price manipulation which unfavourably affects the consumer. Legislation is
necessarily deferred until the work of the
Committee bas been concluded.

Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have made
for the public service.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The progressive improvement of general
economie conditions in Canada which is
presently much in evidence gives every indication of continuing in increasing measure. I
commend the initiative, enterprise and indomitable spirit of the Canadian people and,
for the many blessings that have been bestowed
upon our Dominion, I join with you in heartfelt
thanks to Divine Providence.
