Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Since last you met for deliberation, al
countries have corne to have a clearer conception
of the magnitude of the present confiiet and
ita menace te civilization. Âddjtjonal nations
have been threatened with war, or have become
involved in war. But little of freedom is now
left in Europe. Force and fear have been
supplemented by subtie intrigue. International
tension hias been heightened by the formation
cf an alliance between the Axis powers and
Japan.
While these events have added enormously
to the uncertainties of the world situation,
other events of even greater significance have
served te confirm our confidence in the ultimate
outcome cf the struggle. First and foremoat
has been the magnificent resistance of the

the forces cf aggression.
The spectacular
advance of the enemy bas been halted by the
indomitable spirit cf her people.
The destruction cf freedom throughout Europe
han awakened, in the western hemiaphere, a
f uller conscicuanens cf the Nazi menace. , 'n
the face of the common peril there have arisen
a dloser association and an increasing measure
cf co-operation between the United States cf
America and the nations cf the British
Comnmonwealth.
You have been summoned at this time that
opportunity may be afforded for the fullest
consideration and discussion cf Canada~s war

effort and cf national probiems which war han
served to intensify or-create. You will be
fully advised cf international developments;
cf

Canada's

co-operation

with

the

United

Kingdom, and cf relations with the United
States. The measures which will be submitted
to you are such as eem necessary to my advisers
for the welfare cf the country, and for the
prosecution cf the war to the utmost cf our
strength.
Members of the Houe of Commons:
Yen will be asked ta make financial provision for expenditure caused by the staté cf
war which now exista. The estimates for the
current fiscal year will ýbe duly submitted ta you
for your consideration and approval.
Honourable Members cf the Senate:

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of bis Excellency the Governor Geners l's
speech at the o'pening- of the session.
bon. ATHANASE DAVID moved that an
Address *be presented Vo lis Excellency the
Governor General to offer the humble thanks
of this bouse to lis Excellency for the
gracious speech which hie has been pleased
to make to both Houses of Parliament.
He said (TranslIation): Honourable mcmbers, alm*ost every one of you present here
to-day has enjoyed a long and often very
fruitful career in politics. Therefore I deemi
it superfiuous, upon rising to address this
bouse for the first time, to point out týhat any
experience prcviously acquired in the Legislature, on the campaign platform or in the
lecture rooma counts for very little at such a
moment, and that the emotion which grîips
me now is very much akin to that which I
experience-d the first time I spoke in public.
.However, your knowledge of men and life
bas, I am quite convinced, developed in you
a great sense of leniency, and, gazing upon
me now, you realize that I face quite alone
a past beyond my reach and a present of
crushing weight.
The past is made up of a thousand inspiring
yet also saddening memories. In this very
House, how numerous are those who have
passed on after long and magnificent years
of service. How many others also, at the
end of a career characterized by scif-denial,
have relived here, through the friendship of
surviving contemporaries, the pleasant mecmories of their youth. Why not confess tbat
there returns Vo my mind at this moment the
figure of him whose naine I bear and who was
long among you?
Believing with an unshakcable faith that
those who bave passed on still observe, judge
and at times criticize our actions, I know that
my father cannot remain indifferent to the
attitude I shail adopt to-day.

NOVEMBER 12, 1940
How bitter and difficuit are the times we
are now living, how enormous the sacrifices
deinanded *of each one of us. We are beginning a chapter of history to be written under
the titie of self-sacrifice: happiness, pleasure
and well-being are dôamed, and there already
appear here and there uneasiness, mortification, self-denial and, in certain cases,
indigence.
That our generation should be called upon
ta pay so dearly for the errors that have
stigmatized world politice during the lait
hundred years may be regarded as equitabie
after ah, especially if we are concerned with
ensuring the happiness, security and contentment of thase who wili follaw in, our footsteps.
How unfartunate appears ta me the lot of
our present-day youth, who, although acquainted with ahl the hardships of a difficuit
situation, have not experienced, as we have,
the carefree jays of other days, the family
life of aur childhood, and are flot even sure
of attaining the -pleasures of maturity. Al
the more hanour ta aur Canadian youth:
setting us ail a great example, they are the
living symbal of an imperishable faith. With
what enthusiasmi did they not respond ta the
variaus appeals their country has made ta
them. They accepted withaut a murmur the
national registration, and ta-day they ifill ta,
overflowing every training camp ini the land.
They realize that after ail they are shaping
their own future, and that their present
efforts may well determine the entire course
of aur national life.
Who cauld abject ta my making a few
special remarks here about the province of
Quebec? I have at times, believing it my
duty, toid my feilow citizens of French
descent certain truths which were unpieasant
and may have appeared ta same ill-timed. It
is therefore only fair that in speaking to-day
ta the entire country I should proclaim the
deep satisfaction we experience in seeing aur
French Canadian youth respond ta the cail
of national duty with that same feeling of
deep attachment and sincere loyaity that ail
aur aid Canadian traditions command.
Wherever yau may go, honourable members, whatever training camp you visit, the
officers in. charge will tell you that their
ranks were rapidly filled wben the cail was
made. On the training graund aur youth,
aithougb they are at an age when other
pursuits might conceivably appeal ta them
more strongly than the bearing of arms, have
demonstrated a lave of self-discipline that
augurs weil for the future.
Our present attitude establishes, I believe,
ta the satisfaction of ail other groupa i
14879-i

3

the nation, that we are fully aware of the
peril ta, aur country resulting from that
succession of triumphs over small nations
which bas made Hitler the master of Europe.
Passessing certain qualities inherited fram
aur Motherland, as well as certain faults
which we have in comman with its people,
we have too, often, perhaps, displayed in the
past a dangerous and harmful individuaiism.
But there naw arises an occasion, and we
seize it eagerly, ta unite with others in a
mass movement which will ensure on au-r
part a better disciplined effort, an effort
much mare apt ta achieve the end in view.
We have always been a peaceful people.
It would be irrelevant ta state bere the
reasons for this. Let us note, bowever, in
passing, that, having been taught from the
very first ta respect the clauses of the treaty
whicb aur fathers signed on aur behaîf, we
laid down our arms, taking tbem up again
on only twa occasions, eacb time ta defend
aur country against invasion.
Moreover,
strong in aur belief, we had the utmast faith
in the guarantees given us, and if on one
occasion there appeared in Quebec a movement which was termed a rebellion, it is wel
ta remeinber that this mavement also found
favour in Upper Canada and that its professed aim wai the establishment of such
respansible gavernment as we enjay ta-day.
But ail thae is behind us, and if we now
flnd in Qxuebec a striking unanimity of
thougbt on the subject, it is due ta the
fact that its citizens realize how difficuit
their position would become should tbey nat
attempt deflnritely ta acbieve a stronger unity
than ever with their fellow citizens of English descent, convinced that only i such
unity wiIl they flnd the means of ensuring
a post-war period unmarred by quarrels and
discontent, wherein we shahl resume together,
as better friends than in the past, aur jaurney
along the various ways that lead ta the
greatness of aur country.
Honaurable members wha share with me
the same traditions and the same faith, and
speak t/he same tangue, will understand thet
I shouid now address in their own language
the mai ority of those wbo very kindly do
me the honaur of listening ta these remarks.
(Text) Honaurable members, again in this
year of 1940 we are cailed ta meet and ta
discuss laws affecting aur country, and more
particularly ta determine what can be done
that Canada may remai a land of freedom
and liberty.
May I, speaking here for the flrst time,
admit righ-t away that I feel greatly flattered
by the honour conferred upon me of proposing this address. Yet I do nat minimize the

4

SENATE

difficulty of the task, wbicb would perbaps
have deterred me had I flot felt that I
could depend. on the benevolence of men of
great experience who now do me the favour
of listening to my very humble and modest
remiarks.
W-hatever may be the tenor of what I shall
submit to your judgment, may I declare at
the outsct, in order to prevent misunderstanding, that I arn glad of the sentiment
now prevailing in my native province of Quebec. Surely every honourable senator has
noticed the great difference between the feelings and attitude of Canadians of Frenchi
origin in 1917 and to-day. Tbrough better
understanding, and also tbrough a desire to
study Canadian problemns as sueh, what is
now asked from my compatriots of Quebec
as a necessity is regarded with tbe greatest
moderation and the greatest calm. We, on the
banks of the St. Lawrence, know that, as
is acknowledged in the Prairie Provinces,
Canada to-day is fighting for bier existence as
a nation. We know also what the fate of
Quebec would be if to-morrow-but God wil
not permit this--England should be defeated.
Very often in tbe past those coming from
my province were described as idealists, unable
in the economic field to achieve the success
others had attained. This was due to the
fact that our systemn of education bad to be
accommodated to the form and quality of
nientality we had to devehop. We wanted to
remain truc to our origin, and sn our educational institutions encouraged pupils to study
for the professions rather than for finance,
industry and commerce. But to-day wc reahize
tbat we must so plan education that our
youth may be better equipped to take their
place in the financial, industrial and commercial activities of the Dominion.
Yet tbis ideal that has been developed in us
dorninates the youýng men of my people and
makes tbemn desirous of keeping unfurled a
flag under wbich sometimes we have feht
uneasy, but wbicb is a symbol of defence and
protection of the traditions to wbich we nnw
and ahways will adbere.
Furtbermore, this ideal, whicb has been a
tower of strength for our province, makes us
realize that to-day perfect unity of this
country is more than ever essential. At ail
times, as honourable senators will admit, we
have proclaimed ourselves profoundly attacbed
not only to the province of Quebec, but also
to Canada. It may welh lie that, moved by
the words of small minorities among us, you
bave tbougbt at tirnes that our loyalty was
flot siich as was openly declared hy mir public
men. Yet when the day came-it was only
six montbs ago-to prove tbat for Canada
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

Quebec bas always been and will always be
ready to do bier full sbare of duty, see
answered the cahi to the satisfaction of ail
those who reahly place Canadian patriotismn
above every other.
If, in the past, Quebec, proud of the
prestige and influence of France, took a
position wbich displeased some, rnaking tbem
believe that even politicalhy we were inclined
mucli more towards bier tban towards England,
tbis was a profound error. But let tbis be
forgotten. Quebec to-day bas no illusions;
sbe knows lier true position, and if ever a
criais in our national hife lias commanded bier
to appeal to reason and moderation, it is the
one we are passing tbrough now.
Wbo will not admit that wbat bas been
going on for tbe last year in Europe lias very
materially cbanged our way of looking at
American or Canadian security? Up to now
rnany bave believed tbat the ocean between
an aggressor nation and our two countries
was in itself sucli a defence that our common
tcrritory was safe from attack. But wbo
to-day would so afflrn wlio bas read of the
ligbtning attacks on Pohand, Finland, Norway,
Denark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland and
France? Who doubts that, dominating Europe
as lie does to-day, the German leader may
bave the ambition of one day subi ecting to
bis power Canada, and even the United
States? I miglit at this point refer to an
article by Walter Lippman entitled "Wake
Up, America!" wliicb, if 1 remember correctly,
appeared in the Press hast September. In it
lie stated tbat no one in the United States
bad the riglit to dlaim the Atlantic ocean to
be any longer a defence for tbat country.
Let me ask bonourable members: If the
Athantic ocean can no longer be regarded as
a defence for tbe United States, how can it
be relied on by ourselves?
And, if I miay repeat, how couhd we bie
blamed when, as we know, our powerfuh neiglibour the United States feit perfecthy secure,
depending, like ourselves, on tbe Atlantic
ocean, which was considered as a national
defence? But what a chiange ini opinion bas
corne about in face of the kind of war that
Germany can and does make 1 Now it is
acknowhedged in tbe United States that tbe
Atlantic ocean is no obstacle to invasion,
and Americans welh know that if to-morrow
Germany liad command of the sea-let us
hope and pray tbe British Navy will continue
ini control-their tardy defence preparations
wouhd not permit tliem toi view witli serenity
the future of tlie American continent.
But Hitler, once master of Europe, wouhd
not need even to invade this continent to
reduce it to complete and entire economie
dependence. Yet, perliaps bis desire to affirm

NOVEMBER 12, 1940
a doctrine which for him hau to-day, as it
had at the inception of his movement, the
full force of a religion, may incite hiin to
corne here and try to destroy the last great
democracies that would then remain. That
man would hate the continuance of a eomparison between two systeme: hie own, based
on the will of a dictator and the ensiavement
of his own and conquered peoples; the other,
that of the United States and of this country,
based on communion of ideas of millions of
individuals exercising the prerogatives of free
men.
Some have spoken of revolution ini Europe.
This may happen, but surely not while the
powerful Hitler proceeda from victory to,
victory. The only tbing to-day that can
leave us some ray of hope is the magnificent
attitude of the English people. Therefore
we remain face to face with' reality, and
whatever may have been our opinions ini the
past, the peril of invasion is not to be lightly
put aside. Hence, I repeat, it is the duty of
Canadians flot to hesitate to make the
sacrifices our country is asking from us in
our common effort to win the war. In this
way we shail fulfil our greatest duty after
our duty to God-to be useful to our country.
Let us therefore continue to supplement
and strengthen Canadian faith. Let us respond
with enthusiasm to, the appeals made to us,
for nothing can better satisfy our national
pride than to, feel that in this moment of
Canada's danger we can do our duty. Let
me at once reject a reasoning which has
been given expression occasionally, that in
case of attack we can depend on our neighbour to the south. 1 cannot refrain from
qualifying such an attitude as unpatriotic.
Wben we celebrate our national festivals we
declare and sing that Canada is our Mother
Country. Would a son have the right, when
his mother is in danger, to depend on someone
else to defend her, and not on his own courage
and bis own strength? Any passive attitude
would be disloyal and would carry witb it
no beauty, no national sentiment, and no
reason.
Without in the least desiring to create a
divergence of opinion in this House, but for
the sole purpose of .trying to strengtben, if
possible, the unity that exists, may I look
into the past and try to see why at times
there has been a lack of unity? In the past
there have been difficulties between the two
peoples composing the mai ority in Canada.
Let us try to remember and sec wbether
polities have not bad a great deal to, do with
these difficulties. It seemed to some that to,
provoke English Canadian resentment against
the province of Quebec was a happy mode

5

of obtaining success, ephemeral though it
migbt be. In ail sincerity I muet say that
such temporary success has been the cause
of reaction, and sometimes worse than reaction, among my own people. But let the
past be the past.
In recent years we have perhaps been
astonished to see, or rather to, feel, a lukewarm attitude between Great Britain and
certain allies of years ago. We may also,
have feit that certain concessions made to
Germany were detrimental to the peace of
Europe, in that they allowed that nation to
recuperate, to arm and to prepare for war.
Other nations were marking time and trying
to reimburse tbemselves for the big advances
and loans that had been made. But here
again I arn speaking of wbat is past.
I would not and do not hesitate for one
second to declare that I am to-day overwhelmed by the dazzling spiendour wbich
streams from the Crown of England, and that
neyer in the midst of ber pre-war power waB
England greater tban sbe is in the turmoil
of the actual defence of wbat is worth baving
and worth fighting for.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: How often, on looking
at tbe very short communiquée tbat are given
to us by the war ministries of England,_ bave
I imagined mysell in the middle of London
wbile Geranan aviators were spreading fire
and death. I can sec familiar places, buildings and admirable monuments crumbling
into ruine. But at tbe same time I see
emerging from, tbese ruins men and women
looking up to the beavens, sbedding tears
perbhaps, but murmuring a prayer to God that
their heroismn and stoicism may save not only
England, Great Britain and- ail parts of the
Commonwealth, but also the liberty of the
,world, that life may continue to be a bearable tbing to human beings.
May I speak for a moment of that poor,
desolated and crucbed coun.try, Frante? That
country, w'bich wath yours was the glory of
the world, is to-day under German domination. Her eword bas been broken, but in
ber mioe>-ry prayer remain-s -to, ber. Sbe bas
neyer ceased to addTess berself to Godý, and
more Vban ever she wiil prove to the world
the eternal truth that so long as au ideal
remains in the heýart of a people no one bas
the righbt to, deepair. After England bas
vanquisbed the enemy, France wiil one day
-wben, is God.'s secret-come back into ber
own and continue to -illuminate 'the world
with the radiations of ber ooul and her mind.
This is a light that the world cannoct dispense
with. Poor France! She was beaten during
the years preveding the first day of the war.

SENATE

Politics and rnmities had caused those who
had had the firmness and courage to raise
their voice, to speak no more. Defeatism
and pessimism were the reasons attributed to
the frankness of their language. There she
was in all her brightness, intellectuality and
beauty, slowly but surely scuttled by those
whose mission it was to direct her to even
greater splendour. For years the army, not
only in France but in England also, was aware
that new methods of winning a war-much
more efficacious, dangerous and rapid-would
be used; still they were thinking as in the
years 1914 te 1918.
Among the intellectuals of France another
disease was penetrating which caused the
members of her élite to believe in the expressed
desire of the master of Germany to make
friends with bis neighbour. Why did they
not read Mein Kampf? Then they would
never have trusted the man who declared he
wanted their friendship. But what is the
use of thinking and speaking of these things?
They also are of the past.
But before I leave this subject, may I say
that I feel absolutely certain in my soul, in
my mind and in my heart, that the great
majority of the masses of the people of
France every night pray the God we ourselves
pray, that to-morrow England will be vietorious.
It is now bigh time that I should speak of
the present, adding, maybe, a few words of
what we can expect the future to be. We are
now, honourable members of the Senate, by
a unity of effort, re-accomplishing after a
century and more what the two peoples composing the majority of Canada did in other
days when Canada was in danger. The enemy
of those days is our friend to-day; and of
this fact Canadians must be proud and glad.
We are endeavouring by sacrifices, which some
at certain itimes have thought to be excessive,
to help in the best possible manner towards
a finality of the present struggle.
Looking at the world, are we net tempted
to ask ourselves whether the epoch of mechanization, which 'apparently has done so much
to alleviate and render easier the work of
the everyday man, has not created, a power
which to-day does not attempt to better
civilization, but would appear to bring
humanity back te barbarism? In all corners
of the world there is war. Destruction to the
extent of millions of dollars is occurring every
day; there are populations who can bardly
nourish or clothe themselves. Still we believe
we are living in a period of very high civilization.
But this, I suppose. is astray from the
purpose of my remarks on the present. We
bave to face a situation which carries with
Hon.

Mr. DAVID.

it anguish and anxiety, yet we have found
in ourselves a new strength and a new power
of resistance.
We do know that whatever
might be the riches of Canada, however great
might bo its financial condition, whatever its
industry and private finances might be, if
to-morrow defeat had to be admitted, all
would be naugbt in the end. Would it not
be fair that I should here admire the superb
resignation of our Canadian citizens, who
without murmur accept the sacrifices that are
asked of them? Whatever may be the heroism
or sacrifice of individuals, the heroism and
sacrifice of the mass of the people will be
necessary if we are to carry on with success
the great enterprise in whieh we are engaged.
Speaking for the province from which I come,
and knowing also of the provinces from which
honourable members come, I am confident that
this generous common effort can be depended on.
We in the province of Quebec know that
defeat would mean for us the abolition and
disappearance of everything that in the past
has been a source of inspiration, and in the
present a reason for living. We know that
religion, language, laws, traditions would bu
destroyed. and that all we have cherished
and loved would be crushed. We know, moreover, the discouragement there would be
among those who have placed all their faith
in the flag which to-day, as every day, is
flying on the tower of this Parliament. We
know that this flag would not be seen again
here; that British institutions which we have
enjoyed would be encroached upon; that
liberty would be destroyed, and that we
should be treated, not as human beings, but
as mere instruments of the State. We know
that we could not depend on the respect and
admiration of the conquerors, and understanding would become a useless word.
That is why, honourable senators, I make
this appeal to you. In these days of trial,
Let you of English descent
let us unite.
accept this outstretched hand of the province
of Quebec, so that when better days come,
when the sun of peace gives us new rays of
hope. when liberty has been assured in the
world, greater friends we shall be, because
better friends we shall have become. And
this will make for a better and greater
Canada.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, it is my privilege to second the
Address which the honourable senator from
Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) has so ably moved.
At the outset I may tell you that I appreciate very much the honour which bas been
conferred on me. of being given the opportunity to second this Address. But I am

NOVEMBER 12, 1940
very conscious of the difficult position in
which I have been placed by that distinguished
orator from
our neighbouring
province who bas just spoken. I can well
understand how one s0 eloquent, flot qnly in
bis own language, but also, in English, should
have acquired that titie of distînguished
orator. Difficuit as my task may be, stiil,
with your leave, I will set myseif to it.
I intend to deal briefiy with some of the
points which appear in the Speech fromn the
Throne. May I at the outset refer to the
situation that confronted us when we last
mnet here. You will recail that there waz
then a hcavy burden upon us. The toppling
of European countries, one after the other,
before the might of Hitler, eut across our
deliberations and heset our every thought and
action; and at acljournment in August we
were confronted with the fact that Britain
was standing alone, waiting for the invasion
of hier shores and preparing to meet that
invasion. But we know the magnificent story
of the resistance she has offered to the enemy
since that time. So to-day, in the light of
that and other tbings which have happened,
I say that the way to victory is less dark,
the pattera of victory less obscure. The way
rnay stili be long and the task may take our
last ounce of effort, but, however prolonged
and exhausting it may be, we, in common
with the British people, have set ourselves
ta it. We have set ourselves to it with ail
our intellect and ail our industry and ail our
man-power, and we will not cease from that
task until those forces of evii that are abroad
ini the worid have been destroyed, and the
bdight on our civilization bas been completely
removed.
Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, hear.
Hon. M.r. HAYDEN: To-day in Canada
our industry is vying with that of the English people.
Our whole industrial life is
tuning up to an ever-mncreasing scale of production of war materials. The Goverament
is entitled to great praise for the manner in
which the industrial activities of the country have been organized. And I think in
particular it has been fortunate for Canada
that we have had as the Minister in charge
the Hon. Mr. Howe, whose leadership and
direction have given shape to a gigantic iadustrial effort.
Ia passing may I briefly refer to the fact
thýat on, land, on sea and in the air we have
made considerable progress since the Senate
ad'journed. Our Navy has proven its real
wortb, and its great expansion since the outbreak of war has enabled it to render effecetive service in our common necessity. In the
air our Commonwealth Air Training Plan

7

has proceeded with remarkable speed. Our
land forces are also being rapidiy developed,
ia Canada, Britain and other places. Truly,
considerable progress lias been made in a
military sense.
But to-night I intend rather to, deal more
particulariy with that part of the Speech from
the Tbrone which calis for "the fullest consideration . . . . of national' probleins whicb
war bas served to intensify or create." Our
war effort, I recognîze,' is without doubt the
greatest single problein confronting Parliament and the people of Canada at the
present time. However, certain probleins
wbicb have been intensifled or created by the
war must be faced and dealt witb at this turne
unless our war effort is to be barnpered or
even bogged down.
I may be venturing on strange ground when
1 talk about wbeat, but I arn going to have a
try at it. I-t is a very great problem for us
just now. Tbe war bias closed markets that
might have survived the worid-wide wave of
ecoao:ijc nationaiim. To state the figures
as to wbeat is to state the problem. At
present we have approximately 850,000,000
bushels of wheat. Our own dornestic requirements would take care of about 128,000,000
bushels, and we bave storage facilities for
about 425,000,000 bushels. We are taxing the
capacity of our public storage facilities and
also of the farmers' t:émporary storage facilities. So the problem, bas reached tbe acute
stage. How long can we go on piliag up aa
annual surplus of wheat in the expectation of
a market after the wýar?
I say tbe wbeat situation at this turne is a
very serious one for Canada. 1 do not think
we have solved the problein by saying, "Yes,
it is a serious situation, and something must
bie donc about it." Nor do we help tbe
fariner by teliing humi to, grow less wheat, to
restrict bis acreage. Wbat else can hie grow
that would give bim purcbasing power? -If
the Western fariner were to grow for bis
own needs only, then bis ipurcbasing power
wouild be so, lessened that aIl the East and
industrial Canada would suifer in consequence.
And if hie rwere to grow other agricultural
products bie would corne directly into coinpetition with the agriculture of the East.
Tbat is flot desirable, either, for whatever
we do we rnust not put the East and West

SENATE

It is a serions matter. Last year we deait
with it in a patch-quïlt kind of way by
rnaking a direct levy for the purpose of
defraying part of the coet. In ten months'
time we shall have another crop an aur
hands. Where are we goimg ta store it?
For some years Australia has had a similar
problem in connection with sugar cane. I
think the crop this year is about 900,000
tans. One state, Queensland, has attempted ta
salve the problero by .passing legisiation
providing that power alcohol developed fram
molasses must be blended in a fixed percentage with ail petrol sald in that state. I think
I can say in passing that Queensland bas
shown the only way in which alcohol and
gasoline may safely be biended, namely,
ta put bath into the fuel tank. Other
countries, such as Brazil, the Philippines and
Cuba, have been faced with the problem.
of a surplus production of this particular
commodity, which is so important ta the
life of their people, and they toa have used
their surplus sugar cane for the manufacture
of power alcohol.
In September af this year the Commonwealth af Australia appointed a committee oi
inquiry whase instructions were, in part, as
follows:
To inquire into and report upon the utilization of farm and/or agricultural products for
increased production of power alcahol with particular reference ta . . . particular circumstances of the wheat, sugar and other industries
connected with the production of commodities
used in the manufacture of power alcohol.
Now, I arn not suggesting that we should
deal with our surplus wheat by converting it
inta poweir alcohol, for, in the first place, I
arn not a scientist nor a chernist, for do 1
know whether the cost of such conversion
would be economically justifiable. 1 iancy

situation may be, I think that in dealing
with aur surplus wheat we have reached the
stage wahere we have ta face this reality: we
cannat go on yeýar after year establishing
additional distress storage ta take care af
the surplus production. Theref are at this
time it is af vital caneern ta Canada that
we inquire thoroughly and exhaustively into
whatever passible utilization there may bc
for this product if we cannot seli it as wheat.
I commend inast seriously ta the immediate
consideration of the Government the problem
af the possible utilization of this surplus
product.
The second problern which I intend ta
discuss very briefly ta-night, and as ta which
I desire ta cangratulate the Government,
relates ta its dealing with labour and its
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

recent Order in Councîl. Sa that there may
be no rnisunderstanding in case I cannot
recollect the exact words ta define my attitude
in tii regard, I shahl rather closely falluw
my notes.
Recently, as honourable members will have
noticed, the Government passed. an Order in
Council providing for the ereatian of an
interdepartmental board and presoribing substantial penalties as deterrents against the
so-called enticernent or poaching af labour
in the field of war industry. These are the
first steps taken by the Governrnent towards
dealing with a problem. of extreme and increasing gravity. In effect its abject is ta
prevent the movement of labour under a
practice by which the 'highest bidder gets the
man. Inevitably this practice leads ta increased production costs and marks the road
ta inflation. Production for war purpases
must proceed expeditiously, and costs must
not be made excessive. Discipline in war
industry should surely include labour as well
as every other contributar.
Such regulation or discipline is ess'ential if
war production is ta, be done efflciently and
at reasonable cost. nhe supply af labour and
its mast efficient emplayment are the twin
needs af war industry and the country to-day.
Some war industry cannot be expected. ta
pioneer in training men ta work efficiently,
only ta find that its trained men are taken
by -another iudustry coining into the field at
a later time. It is unfair that one industry
should be made the constant training-ground
from. which other industry draws its trained
staff by poaching or eniticement. 1 think it is
fit and proper that the penalties provided for
in this Order in Council should deal severely
with the ternpter, the employer, rather than
with the warkman, who, after ail, shows only
a very human weakness in gaing ta the job
that offers him higher pay.
But in my opinion this regulation must ga
further and must encompass aur whole industrial production. The tendency ta, higher
wages is now clearly apparent. The peril
inherent in this labour situation, unless clasely
regulated 'by the State in co-operatian with
worker and employer, is that it must inevitsJbly lead ta higber costs and inflation. One
begets the other. In the futile chase of
wages and prices, like the pussy cat chasing
its tail, there devel-ops the vicious spiral of
inflation. No one reafly benefits. The wage
earner neyer catches up with the rising prices
and is always discontented, business is upset,
and relapse and depression follow as an
inevitable consequence.
The struggle in which we are engaged is
the comman cause of ahl aur people. Labour
must and will do its part. Bottlenecks in

NOVEMBER 12, 1940
skilled labour, under a proper aystemn of
control, neod no more lead ta higher wage
oosts in those times than bottieneek8 in commodity production need lead 'to higher commodity prices. The War-time Prices and Trade
Board hss in many cases regulated prices of
essential commodities. Excess profits taxes are
designed to, prevent inordinate profits out of
our national necessity. Wages are subject to
no control but strike or lockout and the law
of supply and demand. UJnreasonable wage
increases without, some regulation, fair but
firm, are hound to break down this governmental control and *price-pegging: which we
have set up, and they will oporate to the
injury of the worker and inevitably lead ta
economic chaos. The Governîment is so, much
in business to-day in war production that,
directly or indirectly, it bears t.he brunt of all
wage increases under its contracte with industry; which means an additional burden
upan the taxpayer. 1 am flot advocating any
standardization of wages. I realize that is
impracticable. I am advocating Governrnent
rogulation with the co-aperatian of the
interested parties. I suggest that in this
emergency the Government rnake this labour
regulation wise, but complete. Labour's
obligation to the State in war-time is fia less
definite t.han the obligation of the employer,
or the soldier in the field, t)he taxipayer or
industry. Their respective energies are al
directed down a comman road to a comman
goal.
In view of the approaching conference between the federal and provincial governmonts, I Yant to refer briefly ta Dominionprovincial relations. I do flot intend ta weary
the Bouse wîth references to the report of
the Sirois commission. I start with the principle that financial solidarity is essential if
our war effoirt is to be oantinued, and at an
increasing pace. The war requires large sums
of money, which can came only out of the
earningsand savings of the people of Canada,
s.nd I think the mare goveruiments you have
tapping the sources, the less there is for the
federal authority. If the recommendations
of the royal commission which studied, the
problemns af Dominion-provincial relations can
accomplish this salidarity, and if by putting
into effoot those recammendatians more and
more of the national income and control of
the national purse wiil be left ta the Federal
Governnient, then, in my opinion, the conferenoe is a very important one and it.s
deliberations ought ta ho assisted as much as
possible.
I .am sure it is abviaus that aur Constitution, as interpreted by thé courts, has in many
aspects beoome outmoded. The spectacle of
nine provinces operating aIl the machinery

of a natianal government within the respective provincial limits and competing in many
services and in taxation with the federal
authority, is no credit ta. aur political genius,
and undoubtedly reveals a weakness in aur
constitutional structure.
Some Hon. SENATORSl: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: We cannot at this
time afford ta have aur country's credit
iinpaired by any possible provincial default.
We -cannot afford not ta remove strains and
stresses whore ithey exist in our constitutional
structure, ta the end that aur national unity
may become a greater and groater reality.
The Sirois report hias provided a real basis
of approach ta this problem. The time is most
opportune for the proposed conference. A
Canadian viewpoînt should characterize ahl its
deliberations. Certainly a solution of the
difficulties deait with by the recommendations
will bo welcome ta the over-burdened taxpayer, of benofit ta industry in relief from
multitudinaus provincial taxation, and really
encouraging to business expansion. The Primo
Minister is thorefare ta be commended for
urging attention ta t-his problem at tho present
time and arranging for such a conference. I
trust that its deliberatians will be .thorough,
but swif t. I also trust that any agreeinent
reached may be such as ta lead ta greater
unity and salidarity in Canada.
In closing, I wish ta refer ta just one more
point-the pronouncements which succeeded
the adjournment of this Bouse last session,
relating ta conférences by the Ganadian Government and aur Prime Minister with the
United States authorities. As will be recalled,
these conferences led ta the creation of a
Defence Board and the establishment of naval
and air bases for the protection of this continent. I think that in a particular way the
Canadian Government and the Prime Minister
of Canada have made a great contribution ta,
the cause for which. we are struggling at this
timeAn Ban. SENATOR: Bear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BAYDEN:- -by the manner in
which American thaught and British thought
were hrought tagether Snto a common bond
of understanding and friendship. As a resuit
followed transactions involving the leasing
of naval and air bases at strategical points

«United States destroyers ta the British and

of the great spirit of ca-operation whieh
now exists between Canada and the 'United
States, and the United States and Britain.

SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of lis Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. David
for an Address in reply thereto.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it is fitting at this time
that reference 'be made to the universal
feeling of sympathy in Canada for the family
of the late Prime Minister of Great Britaîn,
the Honourable Neville Chamberlain. I am
not one of those who feit it their duty to
Hen. Mr. HAYDEN.

criticize Neville Chamberlain in relation to
those major features of policy wbich brought
upon him severe rebuke at home, where it was
quite legitimate, and in other lands, including
our own, where it was less legitimate; rebuke
and derision which, I fear, re.sulted in undermining of that confidence in British might
and British honour which was so vital to us
at the time. I recognized in him, as I feel
ail or nearly ail do now, a typical Englishman
in every fibre; a man of stern rectitude and
elevation of character, and as well a man
of marked ability, particularly in the world
of 'business. I recognized in him a man who
by bard toil achieved much indeed, and
who suffered unjustly and cruelly, mainly at
the bands of those wbose policies of the past
had made imperative that step the taking of
which was ultimately to bring uponl bim
severe castigation, and dethronement from
bis high place in Britain.
While we lament bis passing and the
undoubted suffering of body and mind which
be endured, we all, 1 arn sure, with one accord
welcome as bis successor Rigbt Honourable
Winston Churchill. 1 cannot by any stretch
of aspiration dlaimi to be Mr. Churchill's
personal friend, but for a quarter of a century
I bave been bis ardent admirer. In the dark
days of Gallipoli I defended him and bis
,momenýtous proposal.
There is throughout
the world now 'a sentiment very different
from what greeted bimi at that time. Tbrough
ahl the vicissitudes of one of the fullest and
most abundant careers that men have ever

carved out for themselves, I have looked with
hope to the prospect of bis reacbing the
pinnacle; indeed bave neyer been able to
understand how a government of bis own
party or any national government could ever
justify leaving him out of its councils. To-day
hie is the leader of tbe British Empire, he is
the leader of civilization, and, so far as any
one man cen hold the titie, he is the hope of
the world.
I mention next the pleasure wbich we ahl
feel at the recovery of the bonourable leader
of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: -from a
rather serious illness which befell him in the
autumn. His rugged strength and abounding
vitality have triumphed again, and I know
it is to the advantage of Canada that hie is

with us once more.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:

séene of war adequate or nea.rly adéquate ta
Canada's etrengtb and bier honaurable part in
victory. I ask him ta reflect that if the facts
bad not been present ta warrant aur conclusion, it is unlikely that a very large section
of those who apposed us throughout the
struggle, and who had opposed us throughout,
aur political history, would have been flot only
of ane rnind with us on the issue, but, if anything, more insistent on effective action than
ourselves. I do not think Canada even to-day
realizes the, position we were in. Our ranks
overseas were depleted ta a perilous, one
rnight alrnost say a shameful, degree. All
the arts and ail the contrivances ta add ta
the resuits by voluntary response ta aur
appeal had been, adapted -and had failed.
We had virtually either ta acquiesce in the
abandonrnent of our gallant arrny or cIse ta
bring them by compulsion tbe necessary aid
and face the consequences of such schism as
migbt ensue.
It is said that very f ew reinforcernents
reached them under conscription. 0f those
who had been cornpulsorily enrolled, the
number who actually got ta the flghting line
was not large. Had the war lasted three, four
or fi-se months longer, it would have been very
large. The number, however, who reached
those depleted ranks under the shadow of
conscription was gratifying ta a high dcgree.
Régirnents reduced, sorne o! them over haîf,
sorne indeed airnost ta extinction, were restared
ta strength. But a few months ago I spoke
ta anc who had heen in commnand. He told
me of the gallant record of bis own unitbut sixty-flvc men left. Before anc man
reached them under the Military Service Act
the whole régiment, just because that Act
was passed, or certain ta be passed, was brought
up ta strength. Thus Canada marcbed abreast

The honourable senator from Sorel feels

when I say that there is nothing I have more My only suggestion ta him is this. Do not be

calls attention ta the schism w.hich arase in I think, flfty-two thousand. We have bad
1917, and contrasts that situation with the ver fcw casualties, almost noue. Had our
absence of serious schism, certainly of seriaus overseas farces in this struggle encountered the
racial schisrn, to-day. The contrast I quite oasualties which we suffercd in the saine

canscientiaus a belief as ever rnen held, a a great rnany less o! those soldiers averseas

tbat the tâire had carne when there was but very hazardous road lies ahead. Without

Address, consideration of which is now before
us. This regret I feit ail the more on reading
their speeches to-day. I congratulate first
the seconder of the Address <Hon. Mr.
Hayden) upon the very -practical and, I think,
on the whole, wise consideration he is giving
to affairs of high domestic importance at
this time. I think hie haà possibly been rnislcd
by none too sccurate statements of the Press,
and otherwise, ini certain of his conclusions
as ta our war effort, but on the w*hole his
speech was a credit ta himself and one that
this House will rernemiber.
But I corne particularly, with pride as a
Canadian, ta tbe address delivered by the
honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David). I read it to-day with admiration
and with personal joy. The hand wbich he
extends frorn the province of Quebec I should
like ta grnsp; and I doubt whether there is
anyhody in that province with higher authority ta extend that hand. I well recail his
distinguished father, once a member of this
House, as hie was in the habit of listen-ing at
his place in the Commons gallcry, ta same of
us with more or less impatience, but ta his
political idol always with pride; and I arn
sure that father would have been proud ta
hear his son's speech of yesterday.
I thank the honourable senator as a
citizen of this Empire and of Canada for the
just appreciation and splendid comprehension
which he evidenced towards the might, the
majesty and the honour of Britain-towards
the service she is rendering rnankind at this
awful hour. I follow bim without reservation
in the picture lie bas drawn of that other
Motberland of Canada, France, and ardently
I join in bis hope that the resurrection of
that nation may not be far away, and that

resort to any compulsion at ail we sent in the
last war four, five or six times the number
we have sent in this. By the compulsory.
plan we augmented our efforts. There is flot
a human being in Canada who daire say or
dare think we cannot by any possibility reach
the same pass again.
The voIuntary system, for a while anyway,
prevents schismn, the schisma we pay quite a
lot Vo avoid; but withal it is most unjust,
cruelly unjust, and every one of us knows it.
We cannot look forward to conditions which
will ensure its permanency to, the end of this
war. . We might like to, but we cannot. We
do flot know. The vision of man is short, but
the range of events is lon-, and I ask that
so, sincere and honest-mindeýd a man as the
honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David) should not feel in his heart too strongly.
too bitteriy, towards those who sustained
the responsibiiity and endured the heartbreaking pangs cd the last months of the last
Great War.
We are meeting now teo study, nominally at
least, the Speech from, the Throne. There is
littiýe in it that can be the subject of study.
It is true that while it does not foreshadow
legislation, though to do go is the historic
function of a Speech from the Throne, it
opens the door to discussion, which, if proper
information is not withheid, is a vital and
ought to 'be a valuable feature of Parliament's
being. I know-surely I ougýht to knowthat in times of war governments muist have
huge and extraordinary powers. I know that
we had such powers in the last confiict and
that we exercised them; but we sought Vo
exercise, them only Vo the extent which was
essential becausei of emergencies hetween
sessions, or, in the event of an absolutely
quick decision being required on a matter flot
of first-ranking consequence, during the session
itself. We did not exericise them as such
powers are being exercised to-day. As they
are being exercised to-day, Parliament is littie
better than n mockery.
I wonder what will be before us for review.
It will 'be so littie that it would have looked
insignificant, and probably cynical, to put it
into the Speech from the Throne. But does
that mean that important things are flot bein
done, that policies of tremendous moment
are flot being adopted? It does not. There
neyer was a time when matters more fit for
the consideration of Parliament were being
deait with; matters to which parliamentary
con'sideration is pecuiiarly essential.
May I give but one example? I read yesterday a quotation from a speech made by
Mr. Brockington, whom the Prime Minister
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

describes as his adviser, and who, I faflcy, is
even of more importance than an adiviser.
The speech was delivered in PhiladeIphia on
September 12, and from it I read the following paragraph:
A few weeks ago the idealism of our two
peopleCanada and the United States-met the realism of our two governiments.
They met in a pact between your country and
mine, hy which you agree to defend us in
certain eventualities, and we agree to defend
Yeu.

I should like to ask the leader of the Government whether that is true.
Has Canada
entered into an agreement or pact with the
United States to defend that country in
certain eventualities? Has the United, States
entered into a corresponding agreement with
us? These are the words of the spokesman
of the Prime Minister. I ar nfot discussing
the merits or the wisdomn of such -an agreement. I know, however, that for long years
our Prime Minister boasted of being successfui in avoiding any similar commitment with
Great Britain. I want ýto know, bas hie under'taken an international pact, with heavy obligations, behind the back of Parliament, without
even so much as a submission of it to the
representatives of the people of Canada.
Apparently hoe bas. Sometimes, I know, this
Ogdensburg performance is pictured as of relatively smail consequence, not warranting
consideration by the Parliament of Canada
at ail; as providing for just staff taiks between
experts as Vo wha-t to do in certain vicissitudes of attack; staff taiks like those which,
vory frequently occur between nations with
similar defensive purposes. If. the arrangement is such and no0 more, it is strange that
it is elevated to the dignity of a pact; strange
that a spokesman for the Prime Miniister
should say it is an agreement piacing heavy
respansibilities on us. If it is oniy an arrangement for staff taiks, why was it attended with
ail the suits and trappings of photography
-and pubiicity, with a showman on one -side
and a showman on the other, and photographers in between, and heralded as a great consumamation? If it is, on the contrary, what
Mr. Brocekington describes it Vo be, then the
ignoiiing of Parliament ciao neyer be forgiven, and especiaiiy the failure te, submait the
agreement to Parliament. If it is the other,
lesser thing, then the puhlicity is wh.oliy out
of place. In fact, the less pubioity the better.

NOVEMBER 13, 1M4
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have read
themn and I arn discussing this matter from
that point of view to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right
honourable friend is discussing what was said
by a gentleman who miade a speech in
Philadelphia some time ago. But the Prime
Minister spoke for an hour and a half yesterday.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very well.
1 amn discussing the matter as it has been
understood in Canada, as it has been represented by the Press time and time again.
Those words of Mr. Brockington's have neyer
been repudiated. 1 'want to know what the
truth is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right
honourable friend has read Colonel Biggar's
statement on this matter?
Right Hon. Mr, MEIGHRN: I have read
a lot from Colonel Biggar. I have read
reports of interviews given by this Joint
Commission on Defence. They fly to this
cost and that. They look at harbours and
aerodromes on the Atlantic, and i the
evening that master of publicity, Mr.
LaGuardia, gives a statement: "You do not
need to fear anything here ini the province
of Nova Scotia. We will see to your defence.
We are going to make 'proposals, and indeed
we 'have them formulated, now, under which
no enemy can set foot on you-r shores."' And
Colonel Biggar adds, in mach more modest
-terme, "We have had a successful day."
What twilight twittering this is! We are to
be defended by the work of a Joint Commission!1 There le one thing, and oniMy one, as
you can read in the speech of the honourable
senator from Sorel <Hon. Mr. David), which
can ever defend this continent until such
time as the American 'Navy is double and
the American Air Force fifty times what they
are to-day, and that is the British Fleet.
AIl this inepecting of aerodromes and
harbours on the Atlantic coast and the puttiiig
up of some guns on the Pacific, and Mr.
LaGuardia's speeches, I do not know how to
describe, 'but I do know the effect is to
induce our people to hide and seek refuge
under a delusion, to turn their eyes froni
unpleasant and forbidding truths. 0f what
value would these local defences be if the
British Fleet should lose control of the
Atlantic?
0f what value 'wouldà be any
defence produced, by the thirty days' training
of the 30,000 or 300,000 -men here, if the
British Fleet went down? If Britain fille,
at least before our strength-not our speeches,
but our strength-on this continent is multi-

plied, and that mean8 many years hence, our
fate is settled. No man can graep the logical
inference even froni the speeches of Mr.
Roosevelt and come to any other conclusion.
However hampered Mr. Roosevelt may be,
that fact hie knows. I do not take any refuge
under the newspaper interviews of Mr.
LaGuardia or Colonel Biggar. I know where
our defence is, as we all know. And we
know where the decisive theatres of this war
are, and that not one of thera is in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that.

We ail know

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Surely we
know it. Then why make these statemenýts
to delude aur people?
I corne now to the main matter of what I
rose to diseuse. What 1 fear is thçat we are
not directing our efforts to the essential,
vital end. I fear we are dissipating our
efforts and our substance in activities which
appear fine and are popular, but which wil
neyer win this war. If the history of national
confliets hae taught us anything it le that
there le only one way to win a war, and that
is by having the decisive forces at the
decisive point at the decisive time. Are we
contri'buting to that only way of achieving
victory by sending to the actual theatres
somewhat less than 50,000 men? The theatres
are flot in the West Indies, nor in Newfoundland. At some time one of the theatres
may be in Iceland. Others may develop;
poseibly the next one wiil be i Palestine.
But just now the great theatres are i Britain,
Greece and the Middle East. There le where
the war will be won or lost. There le where
our fate will be decided. And what have we
there? We have two divisions abroad. The
number of our men overseas le 52,000, but,
ao far as I know, they are in none of the
actual theatres I have mentioned, save in England. That le not a very ponderous force
for this Dominion. 1 do not think that the
focusing of the.t relatively small army in the
real theatres, and the gathering here of many
thousands of men one-half or one-quarter or
one-tenth trained, and the stationing of a
division on the Pacific and another on the
Atlantic, and ail the rest of our activity under
what we cail home defence, are doing justice
to Canada's power to win.
In emphaslzing that victory overseas le
vital, I cannot refrain from reading words
addressed a few days ago to the people of
the United States by the late Prime Minleter
of Poland:
Britain is suffering terribly, and while she
is bloody she has no friends, or no frienda who
are strong enougli, or bold enough, to offer
her help.

Without Britain the world will be a monstrous
and dark place in whieh to live.
I have fled here for sanctuary because only
here and in besieged England, or the places
controlled by England, is such sanctuary
possible. My own nation of Poland is being
systematically exterminated by brutes.
Do not be deceived.
Let these words ring through Canada.
Do not be deceived. Do not think you can
escape because you are far away. If Britain
dies, so dies America. Perhaps mine is an
old, small voice in the wilderness, but its
message is a vital message. Help Britain, help
Britain now, help Britain with all you have.
Someone may ask: Are we to do nothing
about home defence? I do not say that. But
I read the Prime Minister's speech, where
he says that at Imperial conferences, dating
from twenty years ago, it was agreed that
each Dominion would prepare its own defence,
and after that would give all the help it
could spare to Britain. And this, he says, is
what we are doing. Now, in all sincerity I
say, let us forget the resolutions of peacetime Imperial conferences. By making certain
preparations at home you may be able to do
something against a sporadic attack, here in
Canada, but even a sporadic attack of any
importance is most unlikely in the present
war, because if one of any importance were
made on us it would in all probability bring in
the United States. Of Australia a similar thing
would not be true. All these scores of
thousands of men who are being trained or
half trained-some of them, I fear, to he
bot-house soldiers, because of the way they
are treated in those thirty-day camps-these
men would not be useful against sporadic
attack. even if it came. No invasion can
come while Britain lives. That performance
is a waste of money, of substance and of
human energy. The object to which our every
effort should be directed is as plain as the
sun in heaven: to huild up and train an army
of men on land, in the air and on the sea, and
send thiem to the theatres of war so equipped
that they will be able te win.
I hope I shall be believed when I say that
nobody would rejoice more than I if there
were a veering from the direction in which
we are now moving. If the United States feel
that on account of public opinion in their
country they cannot enter the conflict, that is
their own affair, though it may some day
lead to their destruction. They seek to gather
the great proportion of their forces behind
the lines at home. To the extent that we
take of our substance to build fortresses on
our shores and to hold our men in Canada,
we are certainly fitting into the pattern of
American defence. Yet we should know, and
we do know, that if Britain falls we fall, and
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

that at present we are not contributing as
we should to that victory which alone can
save our nation and our lives. From the
selfish standpoint of Canada, our business
now is to pattern our policy into the British
effort, and, to the utmost of our strength,
make certain of Britain's victory in this con-

flict.

Those words uttered so eloquently by

the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon.
Mr. David) embody an immortal truth. I
beg this House and the Government to act
in the light of that truth, even if, as I do
not believe likely, it becomes necessary to
face some local schisms. And if any in this
country in the party I belong to are instrumental in digging up those schisms, I will
oppose them and support the Government.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let us do
what is of vital importance to this country. We
can take care of schisms here, and nobody
wilýl help more than I. The honourable
senator from Sorel pleaded eloquently for
union-union of heart and union of effort.
Of -his sincerity I have not a shadow of
doubt, and I will help to bring about this
every time I can. But I do put into his mind
this thought, which comes to me every hour:
Would union not be better achieved in this
nation if the Dominion Government itself
represented that union and thus enabled all
Canadians loyally to express themselves
within its compass and contribute to its
efficiency and its success?
We are spending uncounted millions on this
much tooted training scheme for home
defence. I have been told, and I think some
figures were given in the other Chamber to
show, that up to now, including structures
for all these camps, the cost has been approximately $35,000,000 to $45,000,000. We have
taken from the ranks of skilled labour and
other labour men essential to the industrial
contribution of this country. We are getting
little or nothing for this sacrifice. Centre on
building up men to send to the theatres where
the conflict is going to be decided, and centre
on keeping men at their posts to build the
machines to enable others to live and to win.
That should be the policy of Canada.
Under this rather enticing title of home
defence we are, I am afraid, committing a
grave and momentous sin. Home defence, so
called, originates in selfishness. It is blind
to truth; it is distinguished by insularity and
not by foresight; it seeks to pass behind and
shrink from realities that are unhappy and
forbidding, but are overwhelming all the
same. The spirit that dominated the policy
of Belgium, of Holland and of Norway is the
spirit behind home defence appeals in Canada.

NOVEMBER 13, 1940
I fear it is the spirit which too far contrais
the policy of this continent; and if the day
comes--no, if the night cames, the eternal
night when the world crashes into ruin, it will
be just because that spirit and that policy
prevaileti taa long.
The importance of this overshadows al
other niatters. I had intendeti turning to the
subjeet of aur country's contributian ini the
way of mechanisms of war, but for the present
I refrain. The time will came when this
subjeet, which is of great importance, thaugh
stiil of lesser importance, can bc discusseti.
But I cannot agree that we are doing aur
part; 1 cannot agrea that we have used gooti
jutigment and forethought. One reason, 1
think, is that we have 'been mesmerized andi
chloroformed by this papular appeal about

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, my right honourable friend
(Right Han. Mr. Meighen) has ailudeti ta the
dapartura of a statesman of world renown,
R-ight Honourable Neville Chamberlain, who
for a number of years was Priihe Minister of Great Britain. As my right honourable frienti bas saiti, Mr. Chamberlain was a
typical Englishman, a gentleman whose word
was gold, who had bean brouglit up in a
school that was incapable of making false
statements ta the public and, aspiecially ta
foreign nations. Mr. Chamberlain fell because cof his very nature,- his temperament.
H1e cauld not conceive that the represenrtative
of a great nation would enter into an agreement with other nations with the intention
of breaking it nexet day. He coulti not concaive that Herr Hitler, altbough he bati often
acteti contrary ta bis untiertakings, would, on
meeting the Prime Minister of Great Britain,
show that he tid, not -cara for his awn reputation anti intendati ta break bis word. The
Munich conference showed Herr Hitler and
Signor Mussolini in their true colours. They
went ta it with the idea of antrapping the
representatives of Great Brîtain and France
by assuring tham that Cz'echoslovakia's
independence *would be respecteti.
Mr. Chamuberlain was a public man who
dit honour ta his country. H1e attained the
pramiership of Great Britain through bis
devotion to, public life. Hie wss mayor of

and Italy had :braught about his political

demise.
I knew his brother, Sir Austen, very weil.
I had not the ativantage of knowing his father,
Right Honaurable Joseph Chamberlain. The
trio representeti an important element in the
public if e of Great Britain.
I join with the right honourable leader
opposite in expressing sympathy with Mr.
Obamberiain's family.
My right bonourable frienti has referreti in
iautiatory terms ta the speeches made yesterday by my frienti the hxonourable senator
from Sorel (Hon. Mr. Davit) andi my friend
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. fisyten). We were
most happy to hear them, because they brought
ta thîs Chamber ideas in which we are interesteti. The honourabie gentleman from Sorel
bas bad a brilliant career in lis province. He
was Provincial Secretary for a number of
years anti dit valuable work as Minister cf
Education. In this eapacity ha looketi beyand

of years my privilege to sit beside his worthy
father, whom I can now sea enj oyig the
dtays that he passeti among bis oolieagues, and
by the side of bis aid friend Senator Béique.
Yesterday waa the first time I bearti the
honourable gentleman from Toranto. I waa
very much iterested in the constructive suggestions he matie concerning the adLministration of national aiffaire, andi I am sure
that the Ministers responsible for settiing
so0me cf the questions which ha tiscusget will
take note of his remarks. I think we feel
that these two gentlemen are important
acquisitions ta this Chamber.

Most.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I arn quite
sure my rigbt honourable friend is aware,
Great Britain wants to become dominant in
the air and to retain dominion of the seas.
These are the two important areas or fields
where Great Britain needs our belp. I may
tell my right honourable friend that Canada's
effort to support the Mother Country in the
air and on the sea is comrnended throughout
Great Britain. This being so, how can my
right honourable friend despair of Canada
playing its proper role on the ficld of battie?
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Would my
honourable friend permit me? If we deny
to the British Government and the British
people, as we do, the right to criticize
Canada's policy and performance, how can we
make a virtue of their not eriticizing?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not ee
any point in the affirmation that we criticize
Great Britain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not say
that. We as a nation deny to Great Britain,
its Govornment or its people, the right to
eriticize our poiicy or to complain of our
effort. Time and again members of the
Administration, and even individuals who
were not members of it, have beon rebuked
for trying to do so. If we deny themn that
priviloge-and I do not say we are wrong un
denying it-how then can we make a virtue
of our freedom fromn criticisrn?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that

that Canada is ready to answer the eall and

Gardiner bas just corne back from Great

it was explainod to him. Mr. Raîston, the
Ministor of National Defence, is leaving this
week to confer with the British authorities,
and to find out exactIy what more we can
do to furtiier the cause. I am quite sure
that Great Britain just now is not asking
for any mon to help fill the ranks or incroaso
our man-power on the other side. It may
do so lator on, but now it asks only that we
heip as we are doing-and we are bolping te,

friend think that the Governrnont is somewhat backward in heiping the cause? We
have devoted to it ail the strength of the
country. We know what are the needs of
Great Britain, and it is bocause Great Britain
is in contact with the Governrnent at Ottawa
that wo feel secure in the efforts we are
rnaking:
Now, lot there ho no rnisunderstanding on
this point. If we are not sending more
soidiers overseas it is because Great Britain
is not asking for them and does not want
thern. If we are working and spending hundreds of millions on the development of our
air force, it is because Great Britain is vitaliy
interested in that work. If we develop our
naval force, that also is because Great Britain
dosires it. and because it is quito naturai
that we shouid do so from a sense of duty.
We have fifty or sixty thousand mon on the

Churchill stated in a telegram addressed to

done in bringing about harmony and understanding between the peoples of North
America.
Here are some excerpts from the statement
by Colonel Biggar, Chairman of the Canadian Section of the Permanent Joint Board
of Defence of Canada and the United States.
I would ask my right honourable friend to
say if he takes exception to any word that
I may read from this statement by Colonel
Biggar, whom I know to be a friend of his
and held in high esteem by him.
When two countries have a common interest
in the defence of their respective territories
the only common-sense course is for them to
study their problems together.
You cannot solve suddenly problems of common defence. All the possible dangers from
enemy operations must be the subject of profound study in advance of common action. The
governments of the countries concerned must
reach agreement as to the responsibilities each
is to assume. These responsibilities must be
carefully defined. Each government must be
satisfied that the other is capable of carrying
out the task allotted to it. There must be
an understanding about the way the forces of
each are to be reinforced by those of the other.
Troop movements must be co-ordinated; the
capacity of the available transportation facilities
taken into account; methods of communication
between the forces of each country arranged,
and points with regard to supply and the like
worked out in detail. In addition to all this
you have to provide for elasticity in the plans.
You must provide for their modification from
time to time as events require. All this takes
time, indeed it tales a long time. It is
disastrous to leave plans for joint or concerted
action by two countries to be improvised in
the face of enemy pressure. Recent . events
have conclusively proved that.
The arrangement made by the President of
the United States and the Prime Minister at
Ogdensburg meets all the necessities of the
situation. As its name implies, the Permanent
Joint Board on Defence is permanent. It is
to work continuously.
The setting up of the board imposes no
obligation on either country.
The board's
function is to study the problems which arise
and to report from time to time to the two
governments the steps it thinks should be taken.
There is nothing in all of this which need
detract in the slightest degree from the support which Canada can furnish to Great Britain
in carrying on the battles overseas. Nor is
there anything which need detract from the
assistance which the United States bas been
and is giving, in order, as President Roosevelt
recently said, to resist the forces of evil which
are bent upon the conquest of the world and
will destroy whomever and whenever they can
destroy. Indeed the activities of the board
make it possible to strengthen in some degree
that support and assistance.
I cannot understand the argument of my
right honourable friend, who says that if Great
Britain is defeated we shall go down too. I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

am not ready to admit that statement, because
even if Great Britain were defeated North
America would still be here, a continent which
will soon have 150,000,000 people. One of the
countries on this continent is the United
States, which is now providing itself with necessary protection against an invasion by Germany. My right honourable friend says all
that is of no avail. But does he repudiate
the entente, as I will call it, between the
authorities in Washington and Ottawa on
this matter of common defence? Does he
think there is no need for Canada to join with
the United States and give whatever help it
can towards defence of its own shores? Does
be not think Canada should have a sense of
its own dignity and refuse to let our neighbour do all the work? We must make ourselves ready on the Pacific, where we may have
to face an enemy, a friend of the Axis. And
we are facing possible danger on the Atlantic.
Does my 'right honourable friend say that the
understanding reached at Ogdensburg is valueless and should not have been entered into?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I never said
that. I disputed the right of this Government to make an agreement involving obligations without submitting it to Parliament, and
I deny that we have any right to rest our
hopes of salvation in this struggle on any
such agreement or any scheme for continental
defence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We all know
that Great Britain is our first line of defence,
and we are doing our utmost to strengthen it.
But does my right honourable friend believe
that if Great Britain falls we must lie down?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I never
said that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should infer
from my right honourable friend's remarks that
be considers the Ogdensburg agreement is
valueless. I want to know what his opinion
is.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not say
it was valueless. I think all nations with common interests should have staff talks with
respect to defence. It is better to be prepared
to put up a fight, if necessary, than not to be
prepared. But my point is that in the present
conflict there is only one place where we can
be saved, and that is at the scene of war.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We all agree on
that point. The United States, without declaring war, is doing its utmost to help Canada
and Great Britain. I have heard it said that
fifty per cent of its production of munitions
and other military supplies is being sent by

implies that the production of our requirements in men, weapons, equipment, clothing and
facilities for training should proceed with such
co-ordinated relation tô one another that these
components, essential in the making of an army,
should never be seriously out of proportion
to the needs at any given date. In spite of
the difficulties we must never relax our efforts
to proceed in this logical manner. And, of
course, there are great difficulties. For instance,
the enlistment of large numbers of eager men
is more quickly donc than the less obvious,
more complicated, but equally essential action
of gearing up industry to produce all the arms
and equipment they need.
At the present time these components, unquestionably, are not balanced.
We have a
large Active Service Force mobilized in this
country. We have scores of .thousands of
officers and men in our reserve formations.
No better material for a matchless fighting
force can be found in the world. But we have
some distance to go before our supplies of
armament and equipment can be brought up to
the level of the requirements of war or existing
fighting man-power.
Our present efforts must therefore concentrate
on two things. We must utilize to the full all
the skill, ingenuity and facilities we now possess
to advance the fundamental training of all
ranks now in our Army in the science and art
of their profession. We must also intensify
our efforts towards the complete provision Of
the armament required by those men before
they are calied upon to meet the enemy in
battle. I have no doubt of the ability of the
employers and employees in Canadian industry
to meet this latter and essentia] requirement.
I speak for the Army when I say that we
recognize that the provision of adequate manpower for industry is essential if we are to
make that Army fully effective.
Now, I do not wish these remarks to be
taken as an indication that there exists in my
mind any doubt whatsoever as to the vital
importance and significance of the adoption by
this country of compulsory training and of service for home defence of its man-power. On
the contrary, all my life I have firmly believed
that truc democracy means equality of service
of all, for the State, as well as equality of
opportunity for all, within the State. I should
also make it clear that the decision to limit
the initial training period for those young men
vho but recently have been privileged to
inaugurate this scheme to one month is also
based on my recommendation. There were two
important reasons which influenced me to make
that recommendation. Firstly, the short training period enabled a larger number of young
Canadians te gain a proper conception of their
national obligations within a given time.
Secondly, our limited supply of modern weapons
made it impracticable just now to carry the
individual training of these young men beyond
the basic stage, and a month or six weeks of
instruction was sufficient for that limited
syllabus. These factors, though important at
this time, are not of enduring importance, and,
as my Minister stated the other day, consideration is being given to possible alterations
in the training schedule in order to adjust the
period of compulsory training to changes and
improvements in conditions and to the requirements of industry.
It is obvious that we cannot ask the United
Kingdom to provide us these essential armaments in view of the needs of the forces now
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

facing the enemy in the several theatres of
operations overseas.
We cannot now count
largely on provision by our good neighbours,
the United States, as -that country is now faced
with its own great problem of speedily producing modern armaments for 45 divisions and
10 armoured divisions. Nor can we contribute
to the winning of the war in Europe, or
importantly to the defence of our own shores,
by mobilizing masses of partially trained men
with inadequate arms and equipment.
No one contends that in thirty days of training you can turn out a soldier. But, as MajorGeneral Crerar explains, there were important
reasons in favour of the present plan. I want
to add that the bringing together in the camps
of all these young men, many of whom had
previously never travelled far from their own
farm or village, has had a very fine effect
upon them.
They are returning te their
homes delighted with the contacts they have
made and bpnefited by the discipline to

which they have conformed, and I am quite
sure that if they are called to serve again,
as they may be, even to serve for a longer
period, they will answer the call with aiacrity.
I am informed that in many of these camps
already the military spirit has permeated the
young men to the point that they are ready
to enlist in the active forces. I believe that
admirable work has been donc under the
thirty-day plan. The ice has been broken:
the young fellows have been introduced to
military life. Because of lack of equipment
we could not pursue the training much further,
but when next called they will respond as
readily as they did at the outset, and with
considerably more enthusiasm, because they
now appreciate the advantages of the training

they have already had.
I come now to the Navy. My right honourable friend said: " There is nothing announced
in the Speech from the Throne except that
measures

will

be

submitted

conducive

to

advancing the efforts of the country towards
winning the war." But my right honourable
friend knows full well that Parliament is now
in session in order that those who desire firsthand information on Canada's war work may
get it, and I believe the Senate is interested
in getting such first-hand information.
Since the outbreak of war the development
of our small Canadian Navy has been little
short of phenomenal. Even in the last three
months its personnel has risen from about
9,000 at the beginning of August to 13,034
on November 7. At the beginning of August
we had about 130 vessels in commission,
excluding destroyers. By the end of October
the number had risen to over 140, and, as
well, 17 corvettes and 4 minesweepers of our

new construction had already been launched.

NOVEMBER 13, 1940
lni the samne period, thanirs to the arrangement concluded with the United States, aur
destroyer strength has daubled; we now have
12 destroyers in commission. It i. a tribute at
once ta the efficiency of aur Naval Service sud
ta the eagerness of Canadians ta valunteer for
the defence af their country that no difficulty
has been found ini enflisting erews for the new
vessels. Indeed, there are far more young
Canadians eager te jain than the Navy with. its
present establishment can passibly take. Some
af aur destroyers are stili participating, in
Enropean waters, in the defence of Britain
sgainst the threat af invasion. Our Navy, taa,
continues its vigilant patral of our own coasta
and takes ils part in the vital task of keeping
open the life-lines af Britain across the North
Atlantic. It was a source cf particular satisfaction for Canadians to learn af the gallant
exploit of the canverted merchaut cruiser
"Prince Robert " in capturing the German
merchant vessel " Weser " off the Pacific cost
of Mexico.
With the leave af the Senate, 1 desire ta
insert in Hansard a summary af Canadian
naval activity, which I have received from the
Minister of National Defence for Naval
Services, Hon. Mr. Macdonald. With this
statement befare them and my preceding
remarks on this subjeet, my right hanourable

SENATE

With regard to the Air Force and air
training, the Minister of National Defence
for Air, Hon. Mr. Power, told the House
of Commons last July that on July 24 the
Royal Canadian Air Force numbered 1,765
officers and 17,688 men, or 19,453 in all.
By November 2 these numbers had risen to
2,343 officers and 28,256 men, or a total of
30,599. This represents an increase of more
than fifty per cent. In addition, 3,187 men
had enlisted for training as air crews at the
beginning of August. On November 2 this
number had reached 6,884.
The Royal Canadian Air Force continues
to perform its threefold task. Its home defence squadrons continue their constant
patrols over our coasts and coastal waters.
They take their part in the escort of convoys
to and from our shores.
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary 6f the
Air Ministry, Captain H. H. Balfour, visited
Canada at the beginning of September. In
an interview with the Press at the conclusion of his visit he used these words:
I am more than impressed with the progress
made here on the Empire Air Training Scheme.
Just the other day the present Secretary
of State for the Dominions, Lord Cranborne,
said in a speech in London that the Empire
Air Training Scheme was designed to produce,
when in full operation, twenty thousand pilots
and thirty thousand air crews yearly, and he
added these significant words:
It is months ahead of schedule.
Honourable members will recall that at the
time the British Government proposed this
great undertaking it indicated that with the
facilities which Canada possessed this ceoperative effort might prove to be of a most
essential and decisive character. It is therefore a source of no little satisfaction to the
Government, as I am sure it will be to the
Senate and to the country, to have the assurance that the plan is more than meeting
the expectations of the British Government.
With the leave of the Senate, I should
like to supplement what I have just said
by placing on Hansard a statement by the
Deputy Minister of National Defence for Air.
The information it contains will, I am sure,
be of interest to honourable senators.
Canadian Air Force
Our Royal Air Force is developing far beyond
our most optimistic expectations.
We have
more men overseas, more men on home defence,
more men in training, more schools in operation,
more aerodromes constructed, more buildings
ready for occupation, than were contemplated
in our original plans.
The British Commonwealth Training Plan
will continue to be by far our greatest effort,
but our thoughts are overseas with our young
airmen, who are giving a magnificent account
of themselves.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Our Air Force is doing splendid work in
co-operation with the Royal Canadian Navy
in defence of the East and West coast waters.
More than 3,000 ships, representing a total
tonnage of over 17 million tons, were convoyed from our Eastern coasts. Not one of
these ships bas been lost while under Canadian protection on this side of the Atlantic.
These patrols and defences serve to protect
the carrying of the products of our vital
industries on which depends our capacity to
make war.
One of these industries is that of aircraft.
Before the war its production was below the
million-(lollar mark and it employed fewer
than 1,000 men.
Many millions of dollars have been spent on
capital facilities, including both plants and
tooling.
Orders totalling over 100 millions have been
issued and 10,000 men are being employed.
Within twelve months this number will be
doubled.
Per head of population, Canada is to-day
producing as many planes per month as our
neighbours to the south.
In our long-range programme we contemplate a self-contained industry producing anything from a primary trainer te the largest
long-range heavy bomber, with the possible
exception of aero-engines.
When Great Britain was suddenly faced
with the danger of invasion and had to suspend
the supply of aircraft upon which we were
dependent for the development of the Air
Training Plan, we turned to the United States,
and Canada's aircraft industry, and our appeal
was not in vain.
Our Canadian industrialists answered magnificently and the wage-earners did likewise,
with a zeal that has not faltered.
The British Commonwealth Air Training
Plan, whieh is Canada's greatest single enterprise, is moving along satisfactorily.
Pilots, air-gunners and air-observers, for
service overseas, are being trained rapidly.
There are some 6,000 in various stages of
training, and 2,000 more will join before the
end of the year.
The Air Ministry in London has lent us
the aid of a number of their most expert
officers, and they have established a Liaison
Mission at our headquarters, to keep us in
touch with all new developments in training,
as the result of actual war experience.
We have put up aerodromes and buildings,
and supplied equipment and personnel.
When we were faced with the crisis of
May last, we decided to speed up our construction programme. All buildings scheduled
until the fall of 1941 were to be erected this
year, and all nerodromes to be under development before the frost set in this year. This
is being earried out with the help of a group
of engineers furnished by the Department of
Transport.
People often wonder as to the number of
trained pilots or observers or air-gunners we
are going to send over under the Imperial
plan.
It is not advisable to satisfy that
legitimate curiosity. Even if we could, the
answer given to-day would perhaps not be true
to-morrow, because the plan is constantly being
speeded up. This, however, may be said: that
in June last we had but 500 air pilots, airgunners or observers under training; we have
now 6,000 and more, and we shall reach 8,000

NOVEMBER 13, 1940
by the end of the year. We have sorne 8,000
men whom we are training for our ground
crIews. By the end of the year we shail have
.traîned twice as many pilote as the plan
originally oontemplated, with 48 schools of
various kinda in operation, as against the 36

or
Tribute should be paid te the officers sand
men of the Royal Canadien Air Force who,
under the dynamic leadership of Air ViceMarshal Breadner, are nlot only responsible
for our home defences and our squadron
abroad, but are carrying out with such conspienous success the organization of the Joint
Air Training Plan, -and of Air Commodore
Johnson, who lias the chief responsibility for
the organization -and training of its personnel.
We owe aiso a tribute to the young men who
have answered the cal] and joined the Air
Force.
It is an impressive sight te watch our
young men from the cities and the country
striding acrose our air fields to take their
first solo flight, to watch thege young men
working over lathes and benches, over precisioin
machines, over angines and dismantled aircraft.
If you could see the faces of these
French-speaking and English-speaking Canadisais WOrking aide iby aide, yon would ask, nlot
whether young Canada la ready to do its part,
but only how, and whether the reat of us can
prove ourselves worthy of them.
With regard to war supplies, I desire to
submit a brief statement of expenditures.
Further details and subdivisions of these
expenditures will be furnished by my honourable colleagne from Inkerman <Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), li whose handa I have placed the
necessary data. This is the statement:
The moat graphic index of the progres made
in, furniahing needed munitions und other w'ar
supplies and equipment is perhaps the total of
war contracts let.
On August 12, we had
awarded, for the account of Canada, contracta
th -the total aounit of *302,000,000.
By November 14 that amount had been
inoreiaaed te more than $443,000,000. Of the
$443,000,000 worth of contracta 87 per cent
ha've been placed -in Canadu, 8 per cent in the
United Kingdom, anid 5 per cent in the United
States.
In additioni to these amounts, Canadïan

1 shall conclude my account cf Canada's
war effort by a very brief summary of our

war finance. I need net remind the House
of the principles on which the Government
lias decided that our war effort should, as
far as possible, be financed. We have relied
upon taxation and upon domestic borrewing.
Even if we desired te use them, foreign
markets are net at present availahie.
In the flrst twelve menths of the war our
expenditure was $290,000,000, or about 8800,000
a day. The collapse of the resistance te the
Nazi effensive en the continent cf Europe,
and the oliminatien thereby of many of the
pretective facters of time and space, were
fellowed by an immediate increase in eur
financial and material respensibility. *The
resnlt was a rapid and progressive rise in our
war-tirne expenditures. In June and Jnly
we were spending abeut one and a third
million dollars a day; in August nearly two
millien dollars a day; ini September our war
expenditures were sixty-six millions; in
Octeber they were ever eighty-ene milliens.
The October expenditures were at the rate
cf almost a billion dollars a year.
Our"revenues, fortnnately, are at the higlicat
level in Canada's history. Our second war
boan of 8300,000,000 was over-snbscribed. Its
subscription was broadly based; it was net
unduly concentrated in the bands of banka
and financial institutions, but many thousanda
of small investers. rallied te its support. More
than ene million war savings certificates have
been issued.
Before I resumne my seat, 1 would again say
te my right hononrable friend that if ha.would
only glance at the details of the contracta
which have heen awarded he would see the
magnitude of the Government's effort in
providing equipment and supplies for .our
troops and fer our friends on the other aide.
It is se stupendous that American journaliste
who came here on a tour cf inspection said
that the war effort of.Canada was admirable.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: They were
rather critical.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Suppose I read
the conclusion cf a statement by Mr. Baldwin,
eue of those journalists? It is as follows:
Neverthele, -an inspection of Air Force,
Ârmy, and centres from Hamilton, Ontario, to
Halifax, Nova Scotiýa, showed that Oa>nada's
defeace establishments have bean tremendously
ezipanded in a year of w'ar, that lier progranmmes
to aid Greait Britain and to defend hersei
have beeau censiderably modified, expanded and
apeeded since the German bl.itzkrieg of May
and June; and -that to-d«y the great miajori-ty
of Canada's 11,315,000 people are wholelieartedly behind the Doqninion?s; war effort.
That effort is now passing its preliminary
planning and plant expansion stage, end with
ancreasing speed will commence to prove a
factor in -the war.

24

SENATE

I could quote a number of other statements
to show the surprise of those journalists fromn
the other side at what a nation of 11,000,000
could do. I repeat to my right honourable
friend that hie need nlot worry, that hie may
as well chase away his pessirnism, for Canada
is on the job tili the last day-which wil]
be a day of victory.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will ask the
honourable senator frein Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) to present a statement on the waterways agreement. I think honourable members
are entitled to know the basis of the agreement and the expenditures it involves. As
a former Minister of Trade and Commerce,
the honourable gentleman is we*ll qualified to
deal with the subject.
Right Hon. Mr. iMEIGHEN: Perhaps the
honourable gentleman will permit me to
supplement his quotation frei Mr. Baldwin's
statement *by another, which is far more
flattering to the Government-and I know
my honourable friend wihil be pleased to hear
anything of that nature. This comes fromn
the pen of Mr. J. D. Bowersock, the Kansas
City Star's representative on the recent
3,000-mile journey in Eastern Canada in
charge of very skilful Government officiais.
Here is the compliment hie pays our war
effort, and I do not think we could ask for
more:
Buzzing wheels of industry, the sound of
marching feet, the battie of tanks, the mighty
roar of auti-aircraft and anti-tank, guns and
the rat-a-tat-tat of machine-guns in Canada
to-day are harmonizing with the hum of airplane engines to create a great training
symphiony.
What more could the Governmrent ask for
than that? I do not think anything was
wanting in the entertainment of Mr. Bowersock. "The mighty roar of anti-aircraft and
anti-tank guns--the battle of tanks." We
have not an anti-tank gun in Canada. We
have only one anti-aircraft gun, and it bas
neyer been fired. As for tanks, we have only
little minnows of anme four tons, and there
neyer was any "battie" of them. Certainly
the entertainiment did its work.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Honourable senators-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman allow me? The honourable
senator fromn Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) wil]
close my speech by adding a statement on the
waterways.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right hionourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
should know that divers parts of our equipHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

ment were to be furnished by Great Britain.
Because Great Britain declared herself unable
to furnish that equipment we have been
obliged to turn to the United States, and to
start doing the work ourselves.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: How is it
that Australia bas plenty of these -things of
hier own, of which we have none?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannêt go into
Australia's statemient, but I may say that we
have been proceeding with -the things that
were most essential to Great Britain in this
war.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
it is customary in the House of Commons,
fromn which 1 have recently come, and perhaps in the Senate as well, to extend laudatory
congratulations to the mover and the seconder
of the Address. Somnetimes these congratulations become more or less perfunctory through
reiteration by the varions speakers. I would
not ]end myself to any performance of that
kind, but, after listening to the speeches of
the mover and the seconder last evening, I
should like to say that they discbarged their
duty with a degree of excellence which 1 have
neyer seen surpassed in my twenty-three years
in the Parliament of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The right honourable
gentleman paid his compliments to the mover
and the seconder in terms which I could not
hope to rival; but sn far as the remarks
of the hýonouýrable senator fromn Sorel (Hon.
Mr. David) are eoncerned, I may say that
I was particularly impressed with his statement
of the fact-and I think it is a fact-that
since the war there bas developed amongst
the people of his province a feeling of goodwill towards the people of British extraction
in this country such as neyer before existed.
I believe bonourable members of thîs Chamber will appreciate what I say when I tell
them thýat inevitably there passed th-rough my
mind the wish that the people of the British
and French races of this country may continue
to extend -to Canadian citizens of other races
the samne goodwill and accept their outstretched hand of co-operation, no matter
what their racial origin may be.
Some Hon. SENATORtS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I believe that with very
few exceptions these people desire to be
received into the circle of national unity that
makes for an undivided Canadian citizenship.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I shýould like also to
extend my compliments to the honourable

NOVEMBER 13, 1940
senator from Toronto MHon. Mr. Hayden).
His speech was of a praotical nature. The
Gioverument xnay very weil take cognizance
of bis suggestions with regard ta economie
reforms and constitutionai changes indicated
ini the Sireis report. Perhaps what he bas to
say of certain questions, sucb as that of wheat
a.nd that of the Constitution, does flot corne
entirely within the purview of winning the
war, but, while the conduet of the war ie the
primary consideration cf t>he Government and
of Parliament, I agree that it is aiso necessary that other questions of vital importance
be oonsidered and acted upon by tbe Government and Parliament. For this reason I intend
to speak for a few minutes on two subjects
which are perhaps cf more interest to me
than to others, sinoe they pertain to the province of the Department of Trade and Commerce, with which I was associated. until only
a very few months ago.
One cf these su'bjects is that of the
foreign trade cf this country; the other is
the development of the great waterways
scheme. I need not stress the importance of
foreîgn trade to this country, and I do se
only because, after the somewhat pessimistic
address of the right honourabie gentleman
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), I shouid
like to cast a ray cf light into the situation;
for trade, after ail, is reiated to our war
effort, and the state cf Canada's foreign frade
is extremely gratifying.
The development cf our foreign trade,
especiaily our export trade, is cf vital
importance te thîs country, particuiariy in
time cf war. I have seen repeatedly in one
newspajper the statement that our expert
trade is flot realiy cf importance. I cannot
admît the. truth cf that contention, ini view
cf the fact that we in Canada bave a
tremendous surplus cf commodities which we
cannot ourselves consume and fer which
expert markets mnust be found. I refer te
minerais, lumber, meats and fish, farmn and
dairy produots, newsprint and many manufactured cemmodities, to say nothing of that
otber great asset-whicb is also a liabilitywheat.
Though our experts to the extent cf about
eighty per cent go to the United Kingdom
and the United States in almoat equal proportions, we had prior te the war a very
substantiai foreign trade witb the countries
of continental Europe-the Scandinavian
ceuntries, the Netherlands, Beigium, France,
and even Germany, our exports te which
country amounted to sorne 320,000,000 or
more per annum.
0f course, when the war began the German
mnarket was imsnediately lest and it became
necessary te find new markets or te extend

our old cnes. There was not a great deal
cf loss of trade te the Scandinavian counitries,
the Netherlands, France or Belgium until
the Gerinan armies overran those countries.
But now, in view ef the fact that we have
lest those Eurapesn markets aimoat entireiy,
I think it shouid be gratifying to, the Hous
and to the people ef the country generaliy
te learn that our foreign trade bas expanded
enorrnously, namely, to the extent ef
860,000,000 during tbe last year. Our foreign
trade last year amounted te the great aura
cf 32,150,000,000, cf which 31,150,000,000 in
expert trade. This gives us a favourable
-balance cf trade, which is aiways regarded
as desirable, cf 3160,000,000. To this should
be added exporte cf gold amounting te
$184,000,000. I see no reason why this should
flot be inciuded, because the production of
goid implies empicyment, and gold is one cf
our greatest assets. The fact that we had
a favourable balance cf trade cf 334,000,000
during the last year is reason, I think, for
optimism and encouragement.
Our importa aiso increased by about fifty
,per cent over those cf the previous year..
These consisted largeW cf raw snaterials-a
fact which implies increased activity in our
industriai establishments and ini the production cf goods for expert trade.
Our Empire trade.outside cf the 'United
Kingdam itacîf increased by M2,000,000, the
total being 3130,000,000, and this in spite
cf the very drastie restrictions imposed on
imports fromn Canada by New Zealand and
Australia. Our increase te Great Britain was
thîrty-six per cent, the figure rising fromn
3341,000,000 te 3465,000,000; and the prespect
looks bright for further increases in the
conhing year..
To the United States, whîch takes aimest
exactly the samne quantity cf goods from
Canada as dees Great Britain, our experts
încreased by forty--seven per cent, the total
being $463,000,000. In Soutb America, which
formerly provided a market for German
gocds, we have also increased our trade censiderably. Last year they took 321,000,000
worth cf cur goods, an increase cf sixty-two
per cent. Argentina and Brazil doubled their
importe from Canada. I might say, just in
passing, that the counitries of Seuth America
and Centrai America offer a great potentiai
market, whicb ought te be develeped by
the Canadian Government as mucb as possible. I arn giad te say that I knew the
Department of Trade and Cemmerce la continuing ite efforts to extend trade i tbat
direction.
The West Indies have increased their purchases froim Canada fremn $15,000,000 ta
$20,000,000, and the British West Indies frem

SENATE
$12,000,000 to $17,000,000. There were also
increases in Mexico and Central America,
the products we sent them being largely
newsprint, pulp, automobiles, meats, lumber,
fleur and fish.
Turning again to the continent of Europe,
since the invasion of Norway our business
with Sweden has fallen considerably, dropping
from $5,216,000 to $2,211,000. Our exports to
Portugal increased from $124,000 to $1,.000,000,
and to Spain from a paltry $23,000 to about
$500,000. It is perhaps well to say here that
we have a very definite assurance, as definite
as any such assurance can be, that none
of the commodities exported to these continental countries reach enemy countries.
But, with all this, wheat is still our great
problem. I listened with great interest to
what the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) said last night as to what
might be donc, although his suggestions were
necessarily not very definite. I think it the
duty of the National Research Council to do
all it can to find new uses for wheat.
This country of eleven million people has
cause for pride and satisfaction in the continued increase of our international trade, and
therefore of its enormous volume, which is
so necessary to the conduct of the war.
And now, honourable senators, I will for
just a few moments deal with the question
of the St. Lawrence development, in conformity with a duty which has been entrusted
to me by the honourable leader of the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand). As everyone knows,
this question has been a controversial one
for a great many years. I do not purpose
entering into any controversy now, and I
bespeak the patience of the House if I
mention some matters which perhaps are as
well known to honourable senators as they
are to myself. There are, of course, two
aspects to the St. Lawrence development:
one, that of .navigation, and the other, that
of power. It is admitted now that whereas
there has always been a considerable difference of opinion about the value of a deepened
waterway all along the St. Lawrence, there
can be no doubt of the necessity of developing electrical energy there.
The difficulties in connection with the whole
matter have been manifold. One has arisen,
as I have indicated, because of differences
of opinion in Canada itself, perhaps more
especially in the province of Quebec than
elsewhere, as to the advisability and the need
of a deepened waterway. There has also been
complication because of the international
character of the proposed scheme. Further,
the separate jurisdiction of the federal and
provincial governments has perhaps made the
matter more difficult than it otherwise would
Hon. Mr. EULER.

have been. Another factor that entered into
the case was the diversion of water by the
city of Chicago. Finally, there was the
problem of the heavy financial commitments
that would be necessary in the building of
the waterway.
In Ontario we have a great public ownership development called the Hydro-Electric
system. Whatever the views of some honourable members of the Senate may be as te the
value of public ownership-and I am net
going to debate that at the moment-there
can be little doubt that the publicly owned
Hydro-Electrie power development in Ontario
has been of immense value to the people of
the province. If I may say se, the district
from which I come takes a great deal of
pride in the fact, which may be known to
most honourable members, that the original
suggestion for development of Niagara power
in the province of Ontario came from a
resident of the county of Waterloo, Mr. D. B.
Detweiler, a man of Mennonite extraction,
whose forefathers migrated te that part of
Canada from Pennsylvania. Mr. E. W. B.
Snyder, also of that district, joined with
Mr. Detweiler and they pressed constantly
for action. Finally the great undertaking was
carried te completion and success by the late
Sir Adam Beck. Further honour is due to
that section of the country because of the fact
tha-t the first suggestion for deepening the
St. Lawrence also came from Mr. Detweiler.
And, if honourable members will pardon a
personal reference, I may say that the very
first public meeting called to arouse interest
in developing the St. Lawrence waterway was
held in the city of Kitchener and presided
over by the mayor of that city, who happened
to be myself. A great deal of water has flowed
under the bridges and through the rapids of
the St. Lawrence since that time, and the
waterways subject has been discussed very
often.
As honourable members know, Canada bas
for years had a canal system with a depth
of 14 feet. In 1929 a convention was signed
with the United States, providing for a
certain further diversion on both sides of the
border, and also for preservation of the
scenic beauties at Niagara Falls. That convention did not become effective, because
it was not approved by the United States
Senate. Nothing further was done until 1932,
when another treaty with the United States
was signed, providing for a waterway 27 feet
in depth and the development of some
2,000,000 horse-power of electrical energy.
That treaty received the support of a majority in the United States Senate, but was not
ratified, it having failed to get the necessary
two-thirds vote. There the matter bas rested,

27

NOVEMBER 13, 1940
although in the meantime some considerable
progress has 'been made with regard to the
diversion at 'Chicago. Representations by
the Canadian Government and pressure by
Washington itself have resulted in reduction
of the quantity diverted by 5,000 cubic feet
per second as compared wîth ten years ago.
In 1937 the United States proposed an
agreement for settling all these questions.
As> is well known, the Premier of Ontario,
Mn. Hepburn, objected to the proposai because it would mean a heavy financial outlay
for the province, hie stating that at that time
the power needs of the province were not
great enough to justify the expenditure.
H1e made a counter proposal, howeven, to the
effect that at Long Lac certain waters which
now are discharged into the Hudson Bay
basin should be' diverted by the Ontario
Hydro-Electric Power Commission into Lake
Supenior, and the flow over Niagara Falls
be thus încreased, on the understanding that
the Commission should be permitted to divert
an equivalent amount at Niagara for the
developsuent of electrical energy. But the
United States obj ected to that, pnefenning
to have the whole question of the St. Lawrence
development dealt with in a single agneement.
Nothing further was done until the war
broke out. Then the demands for power in
Ontario became so great that Mr. Hepburn.
declared his willingness to, go on with the
whole scheme of the St. Lawrence waterway.
investigations wene made, commissions wene
appointed, and conferences were held in both
Washington and Ottawa, and are stili being
held.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Thene has
been some develdpment of opinion on the
subjeet.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have no doubt of
that. Thene usually is a development of
opinion on controversial matters of this
kind.
I think I may say here that the United
States acted, rather generously when, after
the Premier of Ontario had consented to have
the whole scheme proceeded with, they agreed
that the Ontario Hydro-Electrie Commission
should be permîtted to divert immediately
a certain quantity of water-I think it is
5,000 cubie feet per second--at Niagara Falls,
on the understanding that the province should
go ahead at once with the diversion eit Long
Lac into Lake Superior. I understand the
diversion at Niagara Falls is already under
way and that the necessary work at Long
Lac is now being done.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Does my honourable friend say that the work at Ogoki is
now being proceeded with?

Hon. Mr. EULER: I understand it has
begun, but I arn open to correction on that
point. If a start has not yet been made, it
will be made very soon, I believe. A definite
understanding has been reached that as more
water is abstracted at Niagara Falls an equal
quantity must be diverted at Long Lac. As
far as Ontario is concerned, the net resuit will
be an additional 70,000 horse-power developed
at Niagara, and 50,000 horse-power on the
Nipigon river.
I think, honourable senators, it is further
evidence of the goodwill existing between
the United States and Canada that representatives of the two countries have been
able to get together and make a substantial
contribution towards solving a problem which
has been very vexatious. Two commissions
have been appointed, one by the Government
of each country, to, work with engineers in
devising the most suitable plan for developing the international section of the St. Lawrence. It is sufficient to say in conclusion
that if and when these commissions report
favourably on a plan and a treaty is entered
into between the two countries, that treaty,
despite fears to, the contrary which may be
entertained by my right honourable friend
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), will be
submitted to the Parliament of Canada for
ratification.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
senators, as hie indicated towards the end of
his remarks this afternoon, my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)- has devolved
upon me the duty of acquainting the House
with the progress made by the Department of
Munitions and Supply during the past few
months in connection with the war effort of
this country. 1 appreciate that I amn inadequately equipped to fulfil such a function,
but I cannot refrain from saying what extreme
pleasure, even joy, it gives me to be able,
if only to some small degree, to, lighten the
load which my honourable friend and leader
carnies, so gallantly and cheerfully, during
the. whole time the Senate is sitting.
Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mn. HUGESSEN: The matenial which
I shail submit to the House is derived from
a memorandumn prepared by the Department
of Munitions and Supply. That memorandum
contains certain material which I arn informed
it wouId not be in the public interest to disclose; so, of course, I cannot disclose it. But
my honourable leader has instructed me to,
say that hie will be glad to supply a copy
of the memorandum. to the right honourable
leader of the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meiîzhen), if he desires tn have it.

28

SENATE

There is perhaps one other preliminary
observation which I should make, and that is
in the nature of an appeal to my honourable
colleagues not to cross-question me too closely
about any of the information which I may
furnish this afternoon. They will realize that
though the voice may be the voice of Jacob,
the hand is the hand of Esau, and Esau does
not happen to be in the House.
By way of introduction, I may say that
the swift overrunning of Norway, Denmark,
Holland and Belgium, and the subsequent
collapse of France, reversed the industrial
war policy of Britain, and consequently of
all the overseas Dominions. These events
transformed a previous reliance upon a
defensive military policy in Europe, supported 1argely by British industry, into the
present situation of a thoroughly aroused
nation, temporarily beleaguered, and needing
an ever-increasing industrial support from
overseas, to permit her later to take a vigorous offensive. This bas involved a practical reversal of the role which had originally been assigned to Canadian industry when
the war broke out.
The work done in Canada. however, prior
to the early summer of this year, proved to
have been a sound preparation for the rapidly
expanded production which bas ensued. One
way of estimating this rapidly increasing
production is to consider figures of the war
contracts which have been let. During the
first three months of this year the average
number of contracts placed each month was
1,910, whereas during the third quarter the
average was 7,500. In September alone contracts were let at the rate of about 325 for
each working day.
Another method of estimating the increase
in the physical production of the country is
to compare percentages of various kinds as
between September, 1939, and September,
1940. For the purpose of this estimation the
production for 1926 is taken as 100. Manufacturing production in September, 1939, was
121 per cent; in September, 1940, it was 159
per cent. Iron and steel production: September, 1939, 98 per cent; September, 1940, 242
per cent.
For certain specific items I have a few
figures which may be of interest, these also
referring to the contrast between September,
1939, and September, 1940. Production of
pig-iron, in tons: September, 1939, 66,000;
September, 1940, 111,000.
Production of
British Columbia timber, in feet, board
measure: September, 1939, 229,000,000; September, 1940, 339,000,000. Production units
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

of cars and trucks: September, 1939, 3,900;
September, 1940, 15,475.
The value of exports to the United Kingdom-another measure of our war effortadvanced during the first nine months of
1940 by 56 per cent over the figure for the
corresponding period in 1939.
I desire now to describe very briefly, under
various headings, certain details of the war
effort which comes under the administration
of the Department of Munitions and Supply.
First, as to the expansion of productive
capacity, the policy of the Government has
been in general to rely upon existing plants
for all war supplies. But in many instances
the plants did not exist, the desired product
had never before been manufac.tured in
Canada, or the capacity of an existing plant
was not adequate to meet the demand. In
these circumstances this Government, or the
British Government, or the two Governments
acting jointly, have provided the capital
necessary for entirely new plants or for extensions to existing plants. The number of
projects undertaken under this heading total
146, and the capital expenditure amounts to
$255,000,000. A substantial number of these
plants are now completed and in operation,
and the remainder are being rushed to completion. Of the money total of $255,000,000,
about one-third is a liability of Canada, and
the remaining two-thirds a liability of the
British Government. As one example of the
increase of physical productive capacity, Canada will within from six to nine months be
able to produce 100,000 tons of brass a year
-five
times the previously existing and
"normal" productive capacity.
The second heading is construction. The
British Commonwealth Air Training Plan of
January, 1940, provided originally for the
construction of 82 schools, covering elementary
flying training, service flying training, bombing and gunnery, air observers, technical training, air navigators, repair depots, air armament, reconnaissance, wireless, and so forth.
These 82 schools will provide for the accommodation of approximately 92,000 men in
the aggregate. The original plan contemplated the completion of all these schools
over a period of two years, but the programme
bas been accelerated and the entire construction will be completed by August, 1941. To
date 36 sehools of the 82 have been completed,
and the schedule for the completion of the
remainder is as follows: This month, 7;
December, 4; 1941-January, 4; February, 1;
March, 6; April, 12; May, 3; June, 5; July, 3;
August, 3.

NOVEMBER 13, 1940
In addition, there have been placed under
construction 37 Royal Canadian Air Force
permanent stations, of which 18 have already
been completed, and the remainder will be
completed by the end of next Mareh. It will
be noted that these stations are for the
permanent service of the Royal Canadian Air
Force and forma no part of the Commonwealth
Air Training Scheme.
But fiying sehools and the like need fiying
fields in order to be effective. Under the Civil
Aviation Branch of 'the Department of Transport, existing fields have been expanded and
new fields developed to keep pace with the
accelerated construction of the training sehools.
As at Septemiber 30, 1940, there were 98
contracts awarded: about half of the work
on those lias now béen completed.
With regard to the other fighting forces, construction has been undertaken of such things
as coast defence batteries, arsenals, magazines,
anti-submarine booms, structures for housing
and servicing of small naval vessels, and a
vast number of other works of numerous
kinds. I do not want to weary the House
with a mass of figures, but I may say that
under this heading 51 contracta have been let
for military services and 21 fo~r naval services,
and of these 29 military and 15 naval have
been completed.
Those figures do not, however, include 29
contracta undertaken by the Department of
National Defence by day labour, for which alI
materials were purchased by the Department
of Munitions and Supply. Nor do they
include the supervision of il other construction projects involving plant extensions and
new plants for munitions, repair of aircraft,
precision instruments, optical instruments, and
the like.
The aggregate value of ail the construction
contracts under ths heading I am now discussing was approximately $89,000,000, exclusive
of the construction under the supervision of
Allièd War Supplies Corporation-one of the
wholly-owned Goverument corporations, to
which I shaîl refer in a moment-and exclusive
also of the cost of the extension of private
plants, which lias been undertaken by private
enterprise with capital assistance from the
Government.
The third heading is aircraft production.
The Canadian aircraft industry has been
created to supply three basic needs: firat,
aircraf t ordered directly by the British
Government; second, aircraft of the Royal
Canadian Air Force for the defence of Canada
and for other purposes; and third, the large
programme needed for the joint Air Training
Scheme.
Honourable members ivili lie
interested to know that the approximate rate
of Canadian production of airframes, lihat is,

29

airplanes complete except for engines, is now
about 50 a week. More than 11,000 persona
are gainfully employed, large amounts of
capital assistance have been extended to the
industry to expand its productive fadilities,
and heavy commitments have been made in
the United -States for airplanes and airplane
engines. In terms of money, this whole
aircraft and aircraft-engine programme totals
about $171,000,000.
The programme with regard teo shipbuilding
includes, among many other items, the construction of 54 corvettes on Canadian account
and 10 on British account. 0f these vessels
31 have already been launched, of which 6
have been delivered, 20 will be delivered in
the course of this month, and 5 will lie
delivered in December.
Turning to mineeweepers, honourable members will recaîl that that programme involved
originally the construction of 28 steam-driven
vessels for delivery, 5 in 1940, and 23 in 1941.
Recently contracts for another 10 of these
minesweepers,
diesel-driven,
have
been
awarded, with deliveries scheduled for 1941.
0f the original contracts for 28 minesweepers
5 have already been launched, of which 2 will
lie delivered this month, 2 in December, and
1 next January. In addition, 181 amaller
vessels of various types have afready been
delivered, and contracte on many more are
being executed. Canada has also acquired and
converted for war purposes a considerable
number of vessels, yachts and misceilaneous
craf t. It will be of interest to honourable
members to recaîl that one of these converted
vessels recently captured an extremely valuable
enemy prize on the Pacifie coast.
On the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence, and
the East and West coasts there are now 17
shipyards engaged in building boats of the
larger types covered by the programme, sucli
as corvettes and minesweepers. There and
elsewhere in Canada are 25 additional ahii>.
yards working on the construction of small
vessels, such as motor torpedo boats, crash
boats, and the like. Honourable members
may like to know what crash boats are. They
are email and exceedingly fast motor boats
to lie rushed out to sea to save airplane
craft which happen to crash in the ocean.
It is estimated that about 14,000 men are
now employed in shipyards and industries
ailied with the shipbuilding programme.
I regard to contracta for automotive
equipment, the need of a modern army for
mechanized transport of ail kinds is now
obvious, and Canada was particularly fortunate in having a well-organized and
efficieûit automotive indýustry. Steps have
been taken to tool up that industry for the

SENATE
production of the various types of mechanical transport necessary. I am not at liberty
to discuss all the figures, but $50,000,000 is
approximately the aggregate value of all the
equipment ordered, two-thirds of which has
already been delivered. To-day the industry
is so organized that, if required, certain
types of trucks could be produced at the
rate of 600 a day on relatively short notice.
The industry is also being tooled up to
produce certain kinds of special tires, required
for military pu-rposes, at the rate of 2,000
tires and tubes a day.
With respect to tanks and carriers: Canada bas never produced tanks, but contracts
were awarded some little time ago for the
manufacture of British infantry tanks for
British and Canadian accounts. Canada is
to produce the whole tank, including the
thick armour plate, but not the engine, which
is to be manufactured in the United States.
The estimated cost is to be about $79,000,000,
and production is expected to begin next
March. Contracts have also been awarded
for a large number of Universal carriers. A
Universal carrier is a type of small, lightarmoured tank carrying a machine-gun and
capable of moving at a very high rate of
Deliveries of these carriers are

expected to begin next month. The aggregate
cost of the contract is about $8,000,000.
May I be allowed te interrupt my remarks
to read this communication which bas just
been placed in my hand:
Mr. Churchill has just made this announcement in the British House: The British Navy
has sunk and put out of business one-half of
the total Italian fleet since Saturday and
Sunday.
Hon. SENATORS:

flear, hear.

With regard to
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
munitions, honourable members will be interested to know that the capacity of the
small--arm
produce
to
arsenal
Quebec
ammunition bas been increased ten-fold since
the war began, and will shortly be again very
largely increased.
Now, with reference to ammunition for
guns, honourable members who served in the
artillery in the last war will remember that
a round of gun ammunition, that is, a shell
ready to fire, includes all the component
parts which make up the final product,
namely, shell, cartridge, fuse, base plates,
primers, driving band, and so forth. Each of
these items requires special plants, special
equipment and skilled labour for its production. Not only this, but a shell-filling plant
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

is also required for the transformation of
the various finished components into a cornpleteiy finished round of ammunition. Eight
plants are actually producing shells, and
nineteen are producing shell components.
Thirteen additional plants are being tooled
up for the production of shells, and four
more for the production of components.
Plants at present producing are being tooled
up for increased capacity. To date, orders
value of approximately
of an aggregate
862,000,000 have been placed for shells of
various types. Of these well over a million
have actually been produced.
On the subject of guns I may say that
prior to the outbreak of the war a contract had
been awarded in Canada for only one type of
gun-the Bren machine gun; 7,000 to be on
British account and 5,000 on Canadian account.
Actual delivery began in April of this year,
and production is now well ahead of schedule.
The capacity of the Bren gun plant is being
substantially increased.
No othber guns are yet in production,
although 40 mm. Bofors anti-aircraft gun barrels of a high quality have already been produced in Canada and are being produced now
in increasing numbers.
Contracts have been and are being awarded,
and tooling is taking place, for the production
in Canada, on British and Canadian accounts,
of a large number of guns of varions types.
This programme bas involved a large amount
of plant expansion and rearrangement. Production of the actual guns will be on a substantial
scale in the latter half of 1941.
With respect to chemicals and explosives
I may say that modern warfare requires a
great variety of chemicals and explosives not
ordinarily needed for peace-time uses, or
needed only in small quantities. Such chemicals and explosives are the basic need for
any munition programme. The list which bas
been given to me includes the names of some
which I am unable even to pronounce. The
last of thern is known as monoethylaniline.
Fifteen separate projects for the production of
these chemicals and explosives are now under
way, both on British and Canadian accountb.
Each project bas required the designing and
construction of entirely new plants, or the large
extension of existing plants. One of the new
plants bas already commenced operations, and
the remainder are progressing satisfactorily.
All are scheduled to be in operation by April
next.

NOVEMBER la, 1940
The whole of the chemical and explosives
programme and the projects connected therewith are being supervised by Allied War Supplies Corporation, one of the wholly Government-owned companies to which I shall refer
in a moment.
With regard to clothing and equipment, I
have a table which, with the leave of -the

House, 1 shall place on Hansard without reading. It consists of three pages, and gives the
quantity of clothing and equipment ordered,
the quantity delîvered to dsate, and the remainder undelivered. It gives this information,
first, for the military services; second, for the
Royal Canadian Air Force, and, third, for
the naval services.

I have one word to say about the Government-owned companies. The Government has
already reported to Parliament, and references
have frequently been made in the public
Press, respecting the Government-owned companies organized to protect the supply of
necessary raw materials, which might be
subject to interruption through causes beyond
the control of Canada. In addition to the
companies already reported upon, honourable
members will be interested to know that a
similar company has been organized to protect another fundamental commodity. Two
additional companies have been organized.
One, known as Research Enterprise, Limited,
is to produce the scientific instruments required for defence purposes; the other, Small
Arms, Limited, is to produce small arms.
Citadel Merchandising Company, Limited,
another wholly Government-owned company,
has continued to facilitate the acquisition and
production of machine tools urgently required
for the war programme. This company has
rendered valuable service to the contractors
concerned, and, indeed, to the Dominion itself.
I turn now to another branch coming under
the Department of Munitions and Supply,
which falis under the heading "Control of

Industry." One of the obligations imposed
on the Minister of Munitions and Supply
under the Act setting up his department is
to examine into, organize, mobilize and conserve the resources of Canada contributory
to munitions of war, and the sources of their
supply; to explore, estimate and provide for
the fulfilment of the needs, present and prospective, of the Government and community
in respect thereto; and to take steps to
mobilize, conserve and co-ordinate all economie and industrial facilities in respect of
munitions of war, supplies and defence
projects. To assist in the carrying out of
these responsibilities, six Controllers have been
appointed as follows:
Oil--G. R. Gottrelle.
Metals--G. C. Bateman.

Timber-H. R. MacMillan.
Steel-H. D. Scully.
Power-H. J. Symington.
Machine tools--T. Arnold.

These Controllers are in effect general
managers of the industries over which they
exercise control. The powers vested in them
are set out in the respective Orders in Council
under which they were appointed, and are
necessarily comprehensive in character.

NOVEMBER 13, 1940
The principle of contrai of industry under
war conditions is generally accepted as reasonable and necessary, and is actually in effeet
under the War-time Prices and Trade Board
as wel1 as under the Department of Munitions
and Supply. 1 may remind honourabie
senators that this was referred ta by my
honourable friend to my right (Han. Mr.
Hayden) in his eloquent speech secanding the
Address in reply ta the Speech fram the
Thrane.
It is not necessary to give the detail of
what each of these Contrallers has dane,' but
in a sentence or two I may touch upan their
accom*plishments.
The Oul Contraller has obtained the coaperatian of the provincial gaveruments concerned i ail contrai. The investigations
made by him indicate that the requirements
af the tbree Prairie Provinces cannot be met
by the productive capacity of the present
praducing field in Alberta. Consequently,
pro-rating of the aýaiIable crude from this
source will become necessary. The Qil Controller bas alsa issued certain orders ini
relation ta additional and un-needed service
stations and gasoline pumps, and the use of
ail fuel in certain kinds of boilers.
The Cantroller of Non-ferraus Metals bas
taken certain steps for the curtailment of
the use of aluminum far domestic purposes,
in order ta release as large a proportion as
passible af this essential metal for military
purposes.
The Timber Controller bas undertaken and
sutcessfuily concluded a wide programme in
furndshing the Government of Canada with
its timber needs in connectian with an
immense building programme during the past
summer. H1e bas prevented injuriaus enhancement of price levels of timber, and
bas assisted the British Gavernment in connectian with the exp art of Canadian .timber
ta supply British needs whicb formcrly were
furnisbed fromn Scandinavia.
The Steel Controlier bas already taken
steps ta increase the production in Canada
of certain alloy steels needed for the munitions programme. Provision is also being
made for new capacity of steel production.
Prices bave been maintained.
Tbe Power Controlder is keeping the Governinent constantly advised of prospective
power demands in relation ta supply. H1e is
ca-operating with the Government witb a
view ta obtaining the most effective use of
availabie supplies. As a resuît of a recomnmendation of tbe Controller, power ta the
extent of 189,000 horse-power is now being
canserved by the continuation of daylight
saving time in Ontario and Quebec.

The Machine Tools Controller bas taken
steps ta bring about the more effective use
of aiýl available machine tools; has caused
machine tools in non-essential industries ta
be made availabie in essential industries;
bas planned for the increased production
of machine tools in Canada, and bas caordinated tbe supply of ail such tools needed
i Canada, fromn wbatever source available.
Weil, bonourable senators, that is the record
of wbat bias been done during the past few
months by the Departmnent of Munitions
and Supply. I think honourable senators
wiil realize that we in this country "May well
be proud of what bas been ac-complished by
that departmnent, and by the industries for
whicb it is responsible, in the few manths
which have elapsed since May last, when the
true scope of the meal effort which we should
he called upon ta make became clear and
plain ta us.

That for the duration of the present session

in the opinion of the Honourable the Speaker
warrant that the Senate meet prior ta the

SENATE

THE GOVERNOR

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yestorday the
consideration of Bis Excellency the Covornor General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. David
for an Address in roply thereto.
Hon. WILLIAM
DUFF:
Honourable
senators, a week ago to-day we assembied in
this Chamber for two purposes: one, to ho
present at the oponing of this session; the
second, to welcome to this country and to
this Parliament Bis Exceilency the Earl of
Athione and his charming consort, Princess
Alice.
Bis Excellency opened the session
with a Speech from the Throne, addressed
both to the Sonate and to the House of
Commons.
Before dealing with that speech, may I say
that we in Canada appreciate the fact that
Bis Mai esty King George VI and the Government of Great Britain sent to us so charming a couple as His Excellency and the
Countess of Athione, and wo hope their stay
in Canada will ho both happy and pleasant.
The Speech from the Throne, as usual,
omits what honourable members may have
expected it to say; and, as usuai too, there
is some criticism bocause the speech contains so littie. In my opinion that lack may
of itself be a good thing. I have for some
twenty-four or twenty-five sessions had the
honour and priviiege of sitting eitber in this
Chamber or in another place in this building, and it seems to me that on a number
of occasions more amendments were made te,
legislation than were necessary. Apparently
officiais in the different departmnents, in order,
as they thought, to show tbey wero doing
their best, passed on to their Ministers certain amendments wbich, either in the next
or the second session after enactment, had
to ho repeaied. So I think that in these
serious limes in the history of Canada it is
perhaps just as well that Bis Excellency, on
the advice, of course, of his Ministers, dealt
only with the subject which is of primo
importance to ail of us in this country.
I think, bowever, honourable senators, it
may be truthfully said that there is something
in the Speech of which we should take cognizance.
Bis Excelleney's Speech, of course,
relates particularly to the war and the aftermath of the war. 1 will not read the whole
Speech, but with your permission I sbould
like to read two paragrapbs. The first is the
one in which His Excellency says:
The destruction of freeclom throughout Europe
bas awalzened. in the western bemisphiere, a
fuller consciousness of the Nazi menace. In 'the
face of the common peril there bas arisen a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

dloser association and an increasing measure
of co-oporation between the United States of
America and the nations of the British
Commonwealth.
I think, honourable senators, that is a
noble sentiment, no matter from whom it
may come. If we are to live in peace in this
world again after the war, especially those of
us who are in this hemisphere, we must be on
gond terras with our neighbours to the soutb
and with the other nations of the Americas.
Therefore we sbould recognize that this clause
in Bis Excellency's speech is a clause well
worth discussing and adopting.
Be goes on to say:
You have been summoned at this time that
opportunity may be afforded for the fullest
consideration and discussion of Canada's war
effort and of national problems which the war
bas served to intensify or croate.
There again, I think, is something with
which we must deal. Not only the Government of this country, with powers that we as
members of this Chamber bave not, but also
the members of this Chamber and of the
representative body sitting in another place
must give fuît and serious iconsideration to
the problems of this country and Great
Britain which are due to present-day conditions, and to problims which may arise in
tbe near future.
Those two paragraphs alone are sufficient
to justify mie in saying that Bis Exceliency
bas earned our praise for making sucb a contribution to the bistory of Canada in the lirst
Speech from the Tbrone whicb bie bas delivered
to the people of this country, through the
Sonate and the Bouse of Commons.
I said a moment ago that there was bound
to be criticism because tbe Speech did not
go as far as it migbt. Knowing myscîf as I
hope I do, and knowing my failings, especially
my partisanship, I can realize tbat there are
many people in this coun.try wbo tbink
"1notbing good can come out of Nazareth."
I must admit-for open confession is good
for the soul-that under other circumstances
and with anotber government in power,
wbetber the Speech from the Tbrone wvas
drafted by the Governor General himself or
wbether he was voicing the opinions of bis
advisers, I migbt be the first to find fauît
with it.
On Tuesday nigbt we listened to two very
excellent addresses, and, if I may, I sbould
like to congýratulate botb the bonourable
senator from Sorel (Bon. Mr. David) and the
bonourable senat-or from Toronto (Bon. Mr.
Bayden),
wbo, respectively,
moved
and
seconded the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Tbrone. The young senator from
Toronto is a new member, but in the speech

NOVEMBER 14, 1940
he made the other night I think lie showed
us that hie is a representative of the people
of this country, and, a worthy person to have
a seat in this Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: I was particularly struck
by the rernarks of the honourable senator from
Sorel. In fact, honourable senators, I was
neyer more impressed in my if e. In saying
this I arn not trying to pay hirn a compliment
on the way lie delivered his address, but I want
to congratulate the cornmunity from. which
lie cornes on the words which hie uttered in
this Chainher to those of us wlio corne from
ot-her parts of this great Dominion.
My riglit lionourable friend the leader of
the opposition (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meiglien)
spoke yesterday. I want to say in aIl truth
that while I felt that perliaps on occasion lie,
like myseif, cannot forget lie came from. a
certain breed, yet I was proud of tlie earnestness and seriousness witli which lie treated
the statements of the lionourable senator
fromn Sorel (Hon. Mr. David). My riglit
honourable friend reminds me of a story I
once heard about the last war. A Scottish
regiment, about to embark for the Dardanelles,
was marching down a street in Glasgow, tlieir
kilts swinging to tlie wail of the bagpipes.
An old lady was standing on the sidewalk
waiting for lier son Jock to pass. When Jock
came up slie suddenly realized tliat there was
something not quite riglit about the way
these Hielanders were marching along, and
she turned to lier neighbour and said, "Tley
are alI out of step but Jock." I arn afraid
My right lionourable friend feels sornetimes
that tlie gentlemen wlio are carrying the lieavy
burdens which have to lie carried at this very
important time in our history are out of step
witli him. That of course is to lie expected.
But in ail lionesty I would say this about the
riglit honourable leader opposite: not only is
lie a loyal Canadian and a loyal citizen of the
Britishi Empire, but lie wants Canada to do
everything that it possibly can do to bring
this war to a victorious conclusion.
In these times we liear a great deal of
criticisrn, from the newspapers and on street
corners, about the way the war is being
carried on. Even in our own homes, soins
niglits when we have flot mucli else to do,
we gossip about liow we would run'the war
if we liad an opportunity. Like other people,
1 myseîf arn sornetimes critical, but I have
made up my mind! that during this crisis in
our national history, because of the fact that
riglitly or wrongly our people in Mardi last
declared i a very decisive way who sliould
carry on the war and govern us for the time
being, I arn going to hold my powder as well
14M7-3j

35

as I can and give the Governrnent a chance to
see what it is able to do. Perliaps Borne of
the criticismn that we hear is justified.
I read in a newspaper not very long ago
that a prominent gentleman, wlio is associated
with a great party, stated this was a Liberal
war. Well, 1 arn willing to agree with him
up to a certain point, In fact, I myself think
it is too liberal, because I feel that there
sliould be no war; that it sliould not be.
necessary to make this expenditure of life and
property in order that peace may lie secured
on this continent and throughout the world.
However, it does seem to me that to cail
this a Liberal war is rather small talk for
anybody. A Liberal warl Wliat does that
mean? I admit that perliaps ini 1914-1918,
when the party I was supporting was not ini
power, I as a partisan may have criticized
the Government and called the war of those
years a Tory war. The fact is, as honourable
senators know, that there are just as many
Conservatives as Liberals in the Army, the
Navy and the Air Force. This is not a
Liberal- war or a Conservative war; it is a
war for Canada-for the protection of this
country and ail that we hold dear. So when
a job that a man is after goca to someone
else, or when lie loses a contract to sorneone
else, lie is not justified i saying that this is
a Liberal or a Tory war.
Wlien I rend th&t staternenit about this
being a Liberal war I started td think a
little. I found that the mnan appointed by
the Governrnent as chief of our overseas
forces could flot by anybody, however politieally blinded, lie called a Grit. I think the
right man is in the riglit place, for Lieutenant-General MeNaughton. is a very brilliant
soldier. The Governrent did a fine piece of
work in appointing him, but certainly partisan politics did not enter into the matter.
If you walk down one of the corridors in
this building you will see a vacant room.
The gentleman who used to occupy that
room. had a gallant record in the last war.
He did not have to go to the present war;
lie would have been as justified in staying
home as any of us are. But almost as soon
as war was declared lie enlisted and left
bis good position liere. He went overseas as
,a major, I understand, but hie is now colonel
of a regiment. Honourable members will
know -that I refer to Colonel Gregg, V.C.,
Sergeant-et-Arms of the other House, another
good Conservative.
Let me corne a little dloser to -home to make
further inquiry about this so-cahled Liberal
war that we are fighting. In my liand I have
a copy of the Senate Hansard of May 28

36

SENATE

of this year, and I find that an eminent member of this Chamber, who also had a gallant
record in the last war, made these remarks:
This is no time for members of the Government to lose their grip and to run around as
distracted as chickens with their heads off,
seeking help from outside sources. We have
within our own country the men and the
material to build up an adequate defence if
we undertake it along the proper lines. What
is needed now is to put some buck under the
tails of members of 'he Government, and that
I shall be pleased to do out of the plenitude
of it that I myself have at the present moment.
[ believe the French army has a strong and
powerful attack still to deliver from the region
of the Maginot line; I believe the British army
should not be moved out of Belgium, but should
be reinforced there; and I believe that in the
end it will be found that Germany has shot
her bolt and that we shall win the war.
That gallant gentleman also offered his services when this war broke out. Surely snmeone in authority-perhaps the Prime Minister
or my good friend the leader of the Government in this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
or some other member of the Cabinet-must
be given a little credit for generositty, because
a week or so after that speech the honourable gentleman who made it was appointed
Inspectnr General of the military forces in the
West. I am sure honourable members will join
with me in congratulating the honourable
senator from Edmonton, Major-General Griesbach, upon his appointment, and also in conmmending the Government for making it, for
we realize that he can do a much better job
than most of us in organizing troops for
defence. either at home or overseas.
No, honourable senators, this is not a war
for any political party. God forbid. The
war is bad enough as it is, but it would be a
lot worse if it were run on a political basis.
The boys overseas and the boys in training
here showed by their votes last March that
those who had enlisted up to that time were
about fifty-fifty Grits and Tories.
In his excellent address of yesterday my right
honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) referred to a statement made by a
gentleman who at the present time holds the
position of adviser to the Prime Minister.
Well, here is further evidence that this cannot
be a Liberal war, because if I know my politics,
that gentleman is a Tory, and if I were in
the Prime Minister's shoes I should not want
to have him around.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
you do not know your politics.

I am afraid

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Not as well as the gentleman you referred to, for he got a job, and,
although I tried last fall to get one at a
dollar a year, I did not succeed.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

In dealing with what was said by that
gentleman in Philadelphia my right honourable friend referred to the meeting at Ogdensburg of our real and very good friend the
President of the United States and the Prime
Minister of Canada, a meeting which will go
down in the history of both countries. I
presume that in Washington there had been
previous conferences at which the views of
the British Government were laid before
representatives of the American Government.
At Ogdensburg certain things were discussed
and a number of matters were brought to the
attention of our Prime Minister, in order
that he might come back here and consult
with his colleagues as to what they felt should
be done in the best interests of Great Britain,
Canada and the United States. The result
of that historie meeting, as bonourable senators know, was the setting up of a Joint
Board of Defence, composed, if I remember
correctly, of five members from the United
States and five from this country. I-t is the
duty of this board to study and report upon
the defences on the Atlantic and Pacifie seaboards and in other parts of both countries.
Their inspections will also take them down to
the Caribbean sea and the West Indies.
Now, I do nat want to charge my right
honourable friend very particularly with this,
but yesterday he referred ta the fact that
Mayor LaGuardia, who is chairman of the
United States section of this board, sometimes talks a little out of turn. I think we
should be very careful how we criticize our
neighbours, for we all perhaps are apt ta say
more than we should, or ta speak at the
wrong time. I feel that President Roosevelt
should be commended for appointing a man
of Italian birth and a prominent citizen of
the United States to be chairman of the
American section of the Joint Defence Board,
and I submit that instead of critieizing
Mayor LaGuardia we ought all to take off
our hats to him.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: That board has had
several meetings, and while nothing definite
has been announced by either Government,
yet the fact remains-again I am presumingthat the United States and Canada are going
ta defend the northern part of the western
hemisphere; of course, with the help of
Great Britain. I will come to that point in a
moment. In the discussions the board decided
that naval bases should be established not
only in Nova Scotia and British Columbia,
but also on the island of Newfoundland. The
board further decided, I understand, that air
fields and naval bases should be built on the
Mr.
islands of the British West Indies.

NOVEMBER 14, 19440
Roosevelt's idea is that, so far as the people
of the western liemisphere are concerned,
North America and South America should
take united action in devising common
meastires of defence.
May I say, in passing, that I cannet understand why, when the Pan-American Conference was field, somebody from Canada could
nlot have sat in.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: After ail is said and done,
Canada must take lier place among the
nations of this hemnisphere. Its defence is
as important to us as to Cuba, Brazil or any
other country.
An Hon. SENATOR: More so.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: Yes, more so. It is of
vital importance that we in this western
hemisphere, with the help of Great Britain,
should be guardians of the seas and the last
hope of democracy. I hope te see the day
wlien, with the nid Union Jack still flying
over Canada, we and the United States and
the other countries of this great liemisphere
shall unite in a common plan for defence and
trade. The great President of the United
States convinced lis Government that the
naval and air bases to which I have referred
were necessary for their protection, and 99-99
per cent of our people went to bed that
night praying to God for a mian like
Roosevelt.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: This idea is something
of which we in Canada should be proud.
We should also lie proud of something else.
My riglit lionourable friend yesterday, quite
properly, told us that the first defence line
of Canada is the British Navy. He is right.
Wliat is the second line of defence? Oh, I
know we are a .proud people; we do not like
anybody te do wliat we think we should do
ourselves; and even if we cannot doe it, we
liate te ask others to do it for us. A girl
who marries lier sweetheart and goes te lier
own house does nlot want te have mucli to do
witi lier mother for tlie first nine or twelve
months, but when the baby cornes the old
lady is sent for, to look after it, and even
the old-maid aunt lias tb corne and help carry
on the work in the house. So I do not feel
that in accepting help from the United States,
either at this time or in the future, we have
to swallow our pride or do something that
is not quite proper and correct. Although
the Britisli Navy is the first line of defence
for Canada and the United States, where
should we lie to-day but for the United
States? Hundreds, yes, thousands of ships

37

have been laden in tlie United States with
ail kinds of cargo, war planes, guns, engines,
oil, and oCher war materials to be convoyed
across the Atlantic. If it were not for that
lieavy and constantly increasing volume of
traffie, where would Great Britain lie? I
cannot quite understand my lionourable
friend from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) in his
reference to the United States. That was
the only part of lis splendid address that I
did net like. We ouglit to thank God, not
only for Roosevelt, but for the sentiment which
now prevails in the UJnited States in favour
of sending every possible lielp to Great Britain.
Even had Wendell Willkie been elected
recently as President, there would have been,
I arn confident, ne interruption in the steady
flow of supplies from the United States to
Great Britain.
We have good reason also to he tliankful
for something else. Recently I was at Halifax
and I saw steaming into -the liarbour eiglit
four-f unnel destroyers. Looking eut of the
window, I said to the gentleman I was talking
witli, "Those don't look like Canadian or
British destroyers." "Oh, no," lie said; "that
is -the thîrd contingent of American destroyers.
Twenty others will be sent next week te be
fitted eut for overseas." President Roosevelt,
witli the hearty approval of the American
people, in the day of our distress, gave to
Great Britain as a present fifty splendid
American destroyers. I have been in -the vessel
business for some years. Whenever I seli a
vessel I take off everything I can.
Some Hon. SENATORS9: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: In this case wliat did
Mr. Roosevelt do? Instead of taking off
armament, provisions, silverware, bedding and
everything else, lie sent those boats to
Halifax so fully equipped fromn gunwale te
keel that there was hardly roomn for a sailer
te sleep. The American people, realizing Great
Britain's position, handed over those vessels
full of supplies, se that when tliey reached their
destination they would not have to be fitted
eut. That is one of the splendid contributions
the people of the United States have made to
us in this war. We kxiow full welI that if
to-morrew the United States would net selI
the Britishi Government any more supplies, it
weuld not be long before the Mother Country
would be on lier knees--no, she will be neyer
in that unhappy position; but we know very
well she could not carry on the war with ber
present vigour.
Therefore I cannot understand wliy anybody, ne matter what his sentiments may lie
in regard te lis own country, sh.euld find any
objection te the good-neighbour policy of
President Roosevelt. As good neiglibours,

SENATE
Canada and the United States can walk down
the road hand in hand. When this terrible
struggle is over, these two countries will show
te the world that, having lived beside each
other in amity for the last bundred years, they,
together with Great Britain-the three great
democracies-intend to see te, it that democratic institutions shall not, perish, but shall
continue in renewed vigour.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) was somewbat worried over
the fcw men we have sent overseas. Again,
1 say, he was right. But this is not the
samne kind of war as the Great War of 1914
to 1918. If I know anything about this warI admit I know very littie-it will be won
in the air, in the Mediterranean and on the
Atlantic ocean. The way te win this war
is not to send a million or two million troops
to be slaughtered on the battle-fields of
Europe. The way to win is to blast-sha]l
1 say the word? No, I won't. Yes, the way
to win is to blast hell eut of Hitler tbrough
the air.
An Hon. SENATOR: I knew it would corne.
Hon. Mr. DIJFF: That is the way the
war must be won. The British Navy wil
also help to win it by starving the people
of Cermany and Italy and making them
realize that the British fleet rules the sea.
A German raider may get out new and again,
but evcntually it is either sunk by our cruisers
or scuttled by its own crew. The glorious
traditions of the British Navy are being
upheld by our Canadian boys. In the Iast
few days we have had an instance of bow
our sailor lads, some from Toronto, some
from the plains of Saskatchewan and other
parts of the Dominion, and seme frorn Newfoundland, conducted thernselves like heroes
wlien the jeivis Bay, an eighteen-year-old
armoured merchant cruiser, went down fighting a German pocket battleship.
She was
sunk, but .sbe saved the convoy. That is
the heroic type of men flghting for us. Let
us keep our pccker up and save our criticism
until after we have won the war. Let us
keep our powder dry, and we shaîl corne
out triurnphant, with the British flag, the
grand old Union Jack, stili flying, ashore
and afloat, as it lias flown for centuries and
centuries.
We are grateful for the help we are getting
from the United States.
But, henourable
senators, the United States is not giving this
for our benefit alone. Whatever help it may
give, so far as the defence of this continent
is concernied, will be given because Canada
is the back door to the United States, and
the United States dare not allow the forces
of a foreign power to corne into Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUEF.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The front
door.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: Yes; better still, the
verandah door. So I say we can accept,
with full confidence and with no sacrifice
of our rights on this continent, anything the
United States now or in the future may want
to do for us and the British Empire.
There is another matter I should like to
deal with, for it concerns not only our war
effort, but also wlbat may corne after peace
is declared. I said a few moments ago that
the United States and Great Britain and
Canada have decided te, establish naval and
air bases both in Canada and in NewfoundI nced flot describe te honourable
land.
members the situation of that island and its
importance from the standpoint of defence.
A few days ago I noticed this dispatch in
the newspapers:
Early action on the sweeping recommendations
of the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations is urged by Prime Minister
Mackenzie King in a cali sent out for a
in January
Dominion-provincial
conference
to consider implementation of these recoinmendations.
Mr. King declares steps are necessary to
enable Canada to achieve maximum effort in
the war.
Now, I tbink there is not a man or woman
in Canada w-ho does not realize that Great
Britain is carrying a very heavy burden. In

home affairs, she lias bier colonies and dependencies scattered ail over the world. One cf

are net doing any more than we should do to
help Great Britain win this war, and after
reading the statement of the Prime Minister
that lie will cail a eonference of the provinces
to discuss matters related to the war and the
period after tbc war, I decided that w'hen I
came here this afternoon I would make a
suggestion to the Governrnent with a view
to ligbltciiing the burden of the Mother
Country. This is not the first tirne the subject

but nothing- was donc. In v-iexv of NewfoundIand's pos.ition in the gulf of St. Lawrence and
its proximity to Canada, the distance frorn
Sydney te Cape Ray being only seventy-five
miles, and from Labrador aci-oss the straits
cf Belle Isle only ten miles, it scems te me
that we might do something to aid Great
Britain in carrying the burden of responsibility
in connection with that island. I think it
wouldý be good business for Canada, in the
discussion that is te take place with the
provinces, te consider thc idea of bringing
Newfoundland int.o Cenfederation and rnaking
bier the tenth province in this great Dominion.

NOVEMBER 14, 1940
The island af Newfoundland je a great
asset ta the British Empire. W-hiie it is
true that in the last -ten years hier finances
have nat been ail they might have been, if
the matter is looked into carefully it will be
faund that hier condition is no worse than that
of our own provinces.
The principal business of Newfoundland is
flshing, and the principal produet is flali. Last
year Newfoundland exported ta ail countries
goods valued at some 334,943,240. To Canada
she exported ta the extent of $3,146,570; ta
the United Kingdom, $13,24e,676, and ta the
*United States, $8,168,162.
In the year 1938-1939 lier imports from ail
counltries a'mounted to. $27,912,351.
From
Canada lier imports were $9,973,700, which
shows that Newfaundland is a good custamer
of ours. From the United Kingdom they were
$6,351,620, and fromi the United States
39,408,729.
The production of the Newfoundland fisheries is-very important. The produet of the
insliore cod fisheries in, 1938 smounted ta,
31,802,500; of the Labrador fisheries ta 31,161,793, and of the Bank fisheries, that is the
deep-sea fisheries, ta $991,895. This industry
alone employed 25,422 men. As a citizen of
the British Commonwealth of Nations I point
with pride ta the fact that moet of those
fishermen to-day are manning trawlers and
minesweepers in the North Sea, and vessels
plying the seas and carrying goads ta, Great
Britain.
The cari ail production was considerable,
cammon ail amounting ta 687,927 gallons,
with a value of $175,000, andi refineri ail ta
243,347 gallons, witli a value of $114,384.
The seal fisheries employed 1,459 men.
The number of seals caught was 226,747, and
their value $490,664.
The export; of salmon, frcsh. and frozen,
amounted to 4,227,573 paunds, with a value
of $338,206; of canneri salmon, ta 39,456
paunds, valued at $5,754; andi of pickled
salmon, ta 481,400 pounris, witli a value of
324,070: making a total value of 3368,030.
The expart of lobsters, fresh andi alive,
amounteri ta 1,385,271 pounds; canned, ta
2,554,685 pounris: a combîned value of
$267,932.
The export of smelts was 278,904 pounris,
valued at $8,367.
Squid, drieri and frozen, was exparteri ta
the extent of 1,009,741 pounde andi a value
of $60,584.
Turbot amounted ta, 372,632
paunris andi a value of $9,781.
Exports of herring, Scotch-cured, amou-nted
ta 5,152,520 pounds, valueri at 361,80; lierring, split and salteri, ta 1,470,563 pounds,

39

with a value of $11,029. Fresh and frazen
herring amounted ta 4,184,790 pounds, valueri
at 87,883.
Fresh cod-flsh andi cai filuets, a new industry in the isianri, amounteri ta 1,145,193
paunds, valueri at 325,767.
Halibut, fresh and filuets, amounted ta
521,919 pounris, having a value of $36,535;
sunflsli ta 14,987 pounris, with a value of
81,198; halibut livers ta 11,449 pounris, witli
a value of $2,862, and clams anri scaiiops
ta 18,015 paunris, valueri at $1,801.
Now wliat about minerai products? Nat
only ta show that Newfoundland is fairly
well developeri, but also ta show something
of what can be done, I may say that a few
days ago I receiveri fromn the province of
Quebec a newspaper, called, the Quebec
Miner, which contained an article on the late
Sir Wiifred Grenfeli. Hie was the Dactor
Grenfeli wlio went ta, Labrador every summer for many years ta look after the sick. I
shall read only one paragraph:
The late Sir Wilfred Grenfeil stated many
times that, given roads capable of even eight
ta ten miles an hour, Labrador would surprise
the world. To its natural resources of timber,
water-power andi minerais lias now been added
one of the major iran are ranges of the world,
and Sir Wilfred's dreamn of the development
and colonization of this vast area sliould in the
nex.t few years become a reality.
Canadian Labrador and Newfoundland
Labrador border on eacli other, and in my
opinion it would lie a great thing if ail that
territary were part of this Dominion.
Last year Newfoundland praduced 1.680,280
tans of are, with a value of 34,284,543.
Limestone was produceri ta the exten-t of
187,480 tons and a value of $188,480. The
production of leari cancentrates amounteri
ta 47,119 tons, valued at $1,342,326; copper,
32,865 tans, with a value of $1,466,879, andi
zinc 122,084 tons, with a value of $977,316.
Graphite was produceri ta the extent of 365
tans and a value of $134,281. The fluorspar
production was 14,000 tons, and the value
384,000. . Pyrophyllite production amountcd
ta 1,000 tans, valued at $1,490.
1 would remind honourable senatars that
tlie iran are supplieri during recent years ta
the industries in Sydney, Cape Breton, and
in New Glasgow, came from the isianri of
Newfound.land.
I came now ta newsprint, the export of
whicli amounteri last year ta 262,777 tans.
0f this quantity 183,920 tons went ta the
Unitedi Kingdom andi 78,857 tons ta the
United States. In addition, 145,035 corde
of pit props were exparteri.
As I said a few moments ego, -the finances
of Newfound.iand -are not in nearly. as bad

l0

SENATE

shape as some of us have been led to believe.
There is only one government in the island.
There are no provincial governments, and
outside of the city of St. John's, the capital,
there is no municipal government. The estimated receipts and expenditures of Newfoundland for the year 1940-1941 are as
follows: ordinary expenditure, $13,825,091;
reconstruction expenditure, $1,534,874,
and
special expenditure, $90,000. This is a total
of $15,449,965. The revenue is estimated at
$13.525,116. This leaves a deficit of $1,924,849,
which is not a very bad showing in view
of the fact that Newfoundland, like every
other country, has spent a great deal of
money in fitting ber boys to go overseas.
We hear a great deal about the public debt.
If this Government decided to approach the
British Government, the public debt would
be a subject for consideration. Newfoundland's debt covers everything, including what
we call provincial, municipal and federal debt.
First of all, there is a bonded indebtedness
of £17,790,000 at three per cent. In addition
there is an amount of £58,759, also at three
per cent, which is guaranteed by the Government of -the United Kingdom, and there is
a bank loan of $625,000, at three per cent.
To show you how closely we are related to
Newfoundland, I may say that this loan was
advanced by the four Canadian banks doing
business in Newfoundland, and was guaranteed by the Dominion Government. Then
there is the war loan of 1940, amounting to
$1,500,000, with interest at the rate of three
and three-quarters per cent. The total interest
on ail these debts amounts to $2,723,293.
I think we all agree that Nova Scotia is
one of the best administered provinces in the
Dominion.
The provincial public debt of
that province, after sinking funds have been
deducted, is-I give the net figure-$72,000,000
as compared with Newfoundland's $120,000,000
for all purposes. But in Nova Scotia there
are in addition, in the different municipalities,
debts amounting to $31,000,000.
Then you
will find that Nova Scotia's proportion of the
federal debt amounts to $160,000,000, and its
proportion of the railway debt is $90,000,000,
these figures making a total of $353,000,000.
This being se, it seems to me that in any
discussion about Newfoundland entering Confederation the question of debt would not
have very much bearing. Whether it has
or net, I respectfully submit to the Government and to the leader of the Government
in this House that at this time, when Great
Britain is fighting for her life and is burdened with heavy cares and responsibilities,
and particularly in view of the fact that the
United States and Canada have joined with
Great Britain on the matter of the defences
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

of the northern part of the western hemisphere, a plebiscite should be taken in Newfoundland, if necessary, in order to ascertain
the feeling of the people. There might be
some objection to that in Newfoundland, but
I think the great majority of the people now
realize the mistake they made a number of
years ago when they declined to join with
us, and they would now be glad to corne in
and form part of this great Dominion. My
principal purpose in rising at this time is to
suggest that instead of six months, a year
or two years being spent on this question,
it could be settled in a very short time by
five business men from this Chamber, including a lawyer, and five business men from
Newfoundland, also including a lawyer.
They would decide within a few hours whether
it would be a good thing for Newfoundland,
under certain pertinent conditions, to become
part of Canada. I respectfully suggest to my
honourable friend the leader of the Government in this House that he submit this proposal
to his colleagues. In the first place, however,
some stated policy should be submitted to the
British Government for the purpose of ascertaining how it would regard the .entrance of
Newfoundland into Confederation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,

I do not intend to take up much of your time
this afternoon. I trust that the honourable
gentleman who has just spoken (Hon. Mr.
Duff) will not feel hurt if I do not follow
him in his remarks. First I should like to
congratulate the mover and the seconder of

the Address, the honourable senators from
Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) and from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden). I was glad to hear what
the honourable gentleman from Sorel said

about the province of Quebec and its people.
They are part of Canada, and unless they and
we, the English-speaking people of ýthis country,
are united, we cannot achieve the maximum
possibilities Canada holds for us. I was much
interested in the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Toronto; but, if I may say
so, I think he knows more about sugar than
he does about wheat. While I agree that it
might be a good thing to have a committee
of inquiry investigate possible uses for our
surplus wheat, I am persuaded that the quantity which could be diverted to the uses suggested by the honourable gentleman would be
only a drop in the bucket as compared with
the crop the Prairies are capable and desirous
of producing.
I have no criticism to make of the speeches
delivered by the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and the right
honourable leader on this side (Right Hon.

NOVEMBER 14, 1940
Mr. Meighen). Our two leaders are masters of
debate, gentlemen of long experience in Canadian affaira, and we are proud indeed that
they are members of this Chamber.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG- I do not intend ta enter
upon a general discussion of the Government
and its policies. I want ta deal with only one
question, and that in but a minor way. But
bef are camin-g ta rthat I desire ta make a
suggestion, though I presurne I shaîl be subjected ta criticism for it. I am persuaded that
a saal cornmittee of the Cabinet, a War
Cabinet, should be formed ta co-ordinate the
war effort of this country. It seern ta me ta
be bey-ond the limita of human ability for some
Ministers ta do what they are requiréd ta, do,
if aur war effort is to be properly co-ordinated.
In the part of Canada from which I corne ýthe
newspapers and public men, irrespective of
politics, are dernanding that a amail caordinating War Cabinet be appainted.
There is one other point that I want just
ta touch upon here. I believe we shaîl not be
capable of aur maximum war effort in Canada
until the Government gives greater recognition
to labour. Under present conditions, it appeara
Vo me, labour has noV -a proper representation
in the makîng of our war policies. I know that
I arn on dangerous ground, for i this country
we bave some labour elements that lean very
much towards the Red; but, by and large,
Canadian labour is a fine body of people, as
loyal as anyone can be ta our country and
our Empire. I believe that anme move tawards
greater representatian of labour should be made
by tbe Goverament at an early date, becauae
I amn inclined ta agree with Grant Dexter, who
in a recent issue of Maclean's magazine said
there is going ta be a clash batween the industrial and tbe military demanda far men. By
"rnilitary demande" I mean demanda for men
in aIl the variaus branches of the arrned
forces.
In tbe past -two days we have listened ta
speeches by representatives from the provinces
of Ontario and Quebec, and, we bave juat
hea.rd a representative from the Maritimes.
I shoukl like to say a few wards with particular reference ta aur Western country.
Before referring to the West's most serious
problem, I want ta say that the Sirois Commission's report, which is ta be considered by
representati','es of -the federal and provincial
governrents in January, ie, I tbink, almoat
unanimously accepted by the people of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and by a
great maj ority of the people of British
Columbia. Some opposition ta the report
will, no doubt, corne fromn Ontario and
Quebec. It is nat that these provinces are

41

less loyal to Canada or less desirous of seeing
the country progresa than are the others, but
adoption of the report would unquestionably
resuit in a heavier burden of taxation upon
these two provinces t-han they are bearing
now. We rnay as well face that fact. But the
whole of Canada ie greater than any part,
and the prosperity of the industrial provinces,
Ontario and Quebec, ie dependent upan that
of the agricultural Prairies. Therefore the
representatives of Ontario and Quebec should
go ta that conference ready ta make a contribution ta the welfare of Canada as a
whole.
I congratulate the Governrnent on calling
the conference, but I want it ýto do more than
that. I want it to put pressure-I mean, i
the proper sense of that term-upon the
two central provinces, ta get them to realize
their responsîbilities in our country. For,
honourable senators, the Commission'& -report
9hould"'be adoptedý, not only i the interest
of our war effort, though its adoption ia
important on that ground, but in the ordinary
peace-time interests of Canada. While the
Western Provinces probably have spent, toea
mucb money ini the past and are now carrying
too large a bonded indebtedness, it must be
said candidly that in making our expenditures
we were not discouraged by Ontario and
Quebec or the financiers in those provinces.
So, if we are guilty of over-expenditure, a
gond many people are accessories after the
fact.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Before -the fact.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:- Yes, before the fact.
The -chief criticisrn I bave ta make of the
Governrnent is with respect ta its agricultural
policy over the last year and three or four
months. I'da not believe the Government bas
realized bow important the welfare of the
agricultural communities is to this country's
war effort. I am not sufficiently well informed
to speak with authority on behalf of the
Maritime Provinces, Ontario, Quebec or British
Columbia, but I feel, hanourable members,
that I may speak with some authority as Vo
the tbree Prairie Provinces, and I want ta
say at once that from the point of view of
agriculture in these three provinces we are in
a desperate state. True, we are getting a
fair price for our bacon, and, at the present
moment, for aur cattle, but the basic industry of that country, wheat production, is in
an awful condition. Now, I do not criticize
the Government-in fact, I compliment itfor setting the price of wheat last fall at 70
cents a bushel. 0f course it would be politically popular on the Prairies ta say tbst we
should have got 87J cents, 90 cents, or $1,
or even, as I believe same people suggested,

14879-4
RMMIED flOI

SENATE

$1.25. However, in my opinion, considering
the general financial situation and the fact
that we are engaged in a terrible military
struggle, the Government did well in setting
the price at 70 c.ents a bushel at Fort William.
But I do criticize the Government for not
announcing its wheat policy until virtually
the end of the crop year, the 31st of July. You
bave only to talk to any Western business
men, farmers, or grain merchants to hiear the
complaint ýthat the Government's policy as
to the handling of wbeat--not as to the
price-was kept a secret until about the first
of August. That is a serious criticism. When
I left here in early August I was bcsieg-ed
by people asking what they were going to be
able to do with their crop.
Let me briefiy outline the wheat set-up.
Canada has storage accommodation for about
450,000,000 bushels. The other day the bonourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) said 425,000,000, but I think the
capacity is at deast 25,000,000 more than that.
In the last three months some increase bas
been made by subsidiary granaries alongside
the ele%,ators; so let us put the outside figure
at 500,000,000 bushels. On the last day of
July, wvhich is the end of the crop year, we
had on hand 300,017,000 bushels. The crop
will produce a yield somewhiere between 550
and 560 million bushels. The last estimate
was 561,000,000, but let us say 550,000,0)00.
That wilI give us a total of 850,000,000. The
very most that we can use in this country is
150,000,000; therefore, after our own wan.ts
are taken care of, there will remain 700,000,000
bushels. If Great Britain takes 200,000,000
bushels of this year's crop it will do well.
That is more than it ordinarily requires. In
past years a larger quantity than that was
sent over there, but a good deal of it was
re-exported. Estimating the, British requirements at 200,000,000 bushels, we can see that
at the enid of the crop year, next July, we
shahl have 500,000,000 bushels on hand. As
that is the utmost we can store, there wihl
be no accommodation whatever for the 1941
crop. If that crop comes up to the fairdy
low average for the last ten years, a considerable quantity wilI have to be kept in granaries
or dumped out on the land. This fail, near
Elm Creek, I saw some 30,M0 bushels dumped
on the ground and covered over with straw.
I submit, honourable members, that within
the next two months the Government ought
to lay down a policy in regard to next year's
wheat crop.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: What would you
suggest?
Hou. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I shail come to that, but
for the moment I want to make a digression.
We do grow oats, barley and flax out there,
and, in parts of Manitoba and Alberta, sugar
beets.
The three Prairie Provinces also
produce a good many hogs and a fair number
of cattle. Manitoba in particular la diversive
in its farming operations.
However, the
economie life in the tbree provinces is Iargely
dependent upon wbeat. When I was a boy.
on the Prairies, fifty years ago, my father
talked about wbeat as if it were gold. We
used to say that wheat was as good as gold.
In fact it was better, because everybody knew
ahl about the grades of wheat and what they
were worth. That was true right up to 1932
or 1933, wheni we suddenly found that it was
not always possible to selI wheat. We know
we cannot selI our wheat. I am persuaded,
bonourable members, that we must try to
find some solution of this problem. I realize
there will be a clamour from the West that
70 cents a bushel is not enough, but let me
assure the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that so far as
my voice and vote are concerned I will back
the Administration in its stand.
This year we have 27,000,000 acres in wheat.
0f these I estimate about 15,000,000 acres to
*be either what in the strict sense of the termn
we ýcaîl summer fallow, or land that probably
bore a crop of clover and was broken up in
July. I arn not sure of the exact figure, but
probably 12 or 14 million acres were in
second-crop wheat.
This is my suggestion: Next year allow each
farmer to sow one-third of bis cultivated land
in wheat, to summer-fallow one-third, and to
cultivate the remaining one-third for bis own
use, but not for wheat. For each acre of land
summer-fallowed, Up to one-third of tbe
acreage under crop, let the Government pay
the farmer $5.
My estimate, which is subject to challenge,
is that about 12,000,000 acres will cover the
summer fallow, which at $5 an acre would
represent a total payment of $60,000,000.
Those 12,000,000 acres produced this year
about 240,000,000 bushels of wheat. Reducing
this quantity by 40,000,000, you have left
200,000,000 bushels, which at 70 cents a bushel
amounts to $140,000,000 as tbe sum the Government will pay next year if its present policy
la continued. That wheat is valueless unless
the war ends. But, remember, the" elevators
are full, and another 500,000,000 bushels will
bave to be taken care of next July. My
proposaI would resuIt in a saving, in round
figures, of fromn 875,000,000 to 880,000,000.
This further advantage would accrue, that
when the war does end the land would be in
sucli shape that the farmers could produce

43

NOVEMBER 14, 1940
crops for years to corne, and this would help
us salve the problem of feeding the starving
people in Europe.
0f course, there will be criticism of my
proposai, but, honourable members, I ivould
point out that by its adoption the acreage
at present under wheat would be cut down to
the extent of 12,000,000 or 14,000,000 acrescertaînly, not Iess than 12,000,000-and it
would drive some farmers into growing a
crop other than wheat. Many af aur farmers
have nearly 45 per cent of their land in wheat
and only a very small acreage ini oats and
barley. This is because we are becoming a
mechanized country. I know many farrns
with only one tearn of horses.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:- There is no market
for oats or barley.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know. I arn coming ta
that. My proposai would affect a greater
acreage in the case of farmers devoting 45
per cent af their land ta wheat, 'but it is a
fair division for the whale country, taking the
big farms with the littie. Furthermore, it
would resuit in the land getting ita better
condition. 1 rnay be tald that $5 an acre le
toa much ta pay for summer fallow, but it
should be borne in rnind that provision must
be made for cost of labour, interest on capital,
taxes, and sa on, and I believe thait the figure
I have suggested is the least at which the
farmers af the West can carry on econornically
during the years ta corne.
If we do not do sornething for the grain
farmers there will be tremendous dissatisfaction throughout the West. Besides, this palicy
would have a strang reaction on the people af
the three Prairie Provinces, and ultimately
you would have them raising hogs, cattie and
poultry and going into the production of
butter, cheese and eggs.
Honourable nernbers may be surprised ta
learn that this year, at nine of the leading
exhibitions in Canada, Manitoba carried off
mare than 50 per cent ai the first prizes for
butter. It bas been doing so for the last
sixteen years. The farmers af Quebec and
Ontario may think they are very goad butter
makers, but the butter makers ai Manitoba
have dernonstrated their ability in this line.
The farmers of Manitoba have aIready gone
into beet sugar production, and I thank the
Government of the province for assisting the
industry. It is already a very prosperous
industry i Alberta, and we in Manitoba are
laoking farward ta similar success. But, after
ail, the fundamental stability of the West
depends -an a reasonable return ta the farmer
for his grain crap. Indeed, parts ai Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta can grow nothing
but grain.
1487"14

I trust that rny suggestion wilI be carefully
considered by the Government i the spirit
in which I make it. I want ta see the war
effort ai this country expanded ta the fullest
extent. I venture ta say that none ai us
wants ta criticize. True, when the war is
over we rnay turn aur attention ta those who
were responsible for such things as we rnay
feel justified in criticizing, but for the present
time we have ta keep aur domestie situation
in hand if we are ta render effective help
averseas. I have listened ta letters frorn
Canadians aver there. They do nat write
about haw the war is ta be won, or about the
Government raising rnore forces. They want
ta know how things are gaing back home.
If the West asks for something impossible, the
request will meet with little syrnpathy. I
submit that rny proposition is flot impossible
at ail. On the contrary, it will lend stabiIity
ta the West, and this, I think, is what we
need, particulariy during war-tirne.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Hanourable senatars, I should like ta deal briefly
with an important point which was raised in
this debate yesterday, the reference of my
right honourabie friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meîghen) ta what occurred at Ogdensburg.
I quote from page 12 of the Senate Hansard:Has Canada entered into an agreement or
pact with the United States ta defend that
country in certain eventualities?

It was, I think, suggested that the relations
which involve the cammon defence interests
ai these two countries began with the Ogdensand what has been
burg conversations
described as a pact or agreement. Actually
what occurred at Ogdensburg was expressed
with as great significance twa years ago in
the city ai Kingston, and at Woodbridge,
Ontario. In Kingston on August 18, 1938,
President Roosevelt said:
We ini the Arnericas are no longer a faraway continent, ta which the eddies af con-

troversies

beyond the seau

could bring no

interest or no harrn; instead, we in the
Americas have become a consideration ta every
propaganda office and ta every general staff
beyond the seau.
The vast amount of aur
resources, the vigaur ai aur commerce and the
strength ai aur men have made us vital factors
in world peace whether we choose or not.
Happily, you and we, in iriendship and in
entire understanding, eau look clear-eyed at
these po8sibilities, resolving ta leave no pthway unexplored and no technique undevelaped
which may, if aur hopes are realized, contribute
ta the peace af the world. Even if those hapes
are disappointed, we can assure each other that
this hemisphere at least shall remain a

strong citadel wherein civilization eau flaurish
unimpaired.

44

SENATE

The Dominion of Canada is part of the
sisterhood of the British Empire. I give to you
assurance that the people of the United States
will not stand idly by if domination of Canadian
soil is threatened by any other empire.

We are good neighbours and true friends
because we maintain our own rights with
frankness, because we refuse to accept the
twists of secret diplomacy, because we settle
our disputes by consultation and because we
discuss our common problems in the spirit of
the common good.
In a speech at Woodbridge, Ontario, on
August 20, two days later, the Prime Minister,
Right Hon. Mackenzie Kin, uttered these
words:
Our people will expect me to express their
warm appreciation of the assurance which the
President bas given directly to them that the
people of the United States will not stand idly
by if domination of Canadian soil is threatened.
Every utterance by the Press and others
througbout Canada during the past two days
bas testified how greatly we value this assurance, and how well we understand it. We
know that these words of assurance are the
words of a friendly people and neighbour.
We are glad that our common affairs have been
so managed, and our mutual confidence so
established, that such words can be frankly
We
spoken and received without reserve.
realize that there is here no thought of military
alliances, which are not a part of the tradition
of the people of the United States nor of our
own. We recognize the President's words as
fresh evidence of the special neighbourly
relations which have grown up between Canada
and the United States, and we are glad that
we are valued as a neighbour.
And, as Mr. Roosevelt bas said, we are good
neighbours and truc friends because we maintain our own right with frankness. As I have
already said, the people of Canada deeply
appreciate all that is implied by the President's
visit. At the same time, they know they have
their own responsibilities for maintaining Cana-

dian soil as a homeland for free men in the
western hemisphere. They will recognize that
there is no room to-day for shirking these
responsibilities. Indeed, the times being what
they are, they will be quick to sec that the
assurance given by the President bas, if anything, increased rather than lessened our
responsibilities.
We, too, have our obligations as a good
friendly neighbour, and one of them is to see
that, at our own instance, our country is made

as immune from attack or possible invasion as
we can reasonably ba expected to moke it, and
that, should the occasion ever arise, enemy
forces should not be able to pursue their way,
either by land, sea or air to the United States,
across Canadian territory.
I submit, honourable senators, that in those
two quotations are to ba found the full
content of anything that occurred at Ogdensburg, and that they represent fully any
commitments that may have been made
between these two countries.
In conclusion, as bearing very directly upon
the relations which have been ao clearly
crystallized between these two countries, I
should like to quote from a very prophetic
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

statement made on March 10, 1938, in the
course of an address given at Chatham House,
in London, by Dr. Arnold J. Toynbee, one of
the outstanding historians of the Englishspeaking world, who for many years has been
a director of studies at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs. His address, delivered
just on the eve of the Austrian putsch,
dealt with the issues in British foreign policy,
and in examining the different courses of that
policy which confronted the Empire he said,
in part:
First let us ask ourselves: Can we maintain
the nineteenth-century Pax Britannica in these
twentieth-century circumstances?
I think there will probably be general agreement that this is impossible for several reasons:
first, because two great powers, the United
States and Japan, are now outside our British
naval ring round Europe; secondly, because the
narrow seas round Europe-the Mediterranean,
the Channel, the North Sea and the Balticcan now no longer be controlled by sea-power,
or anyway not exclusively. They have passed,
at least in part, under the control of land-power
using the air arm. In the Great War, for
instance, the Baltie was controlled by Germany,
and from the air England was attacked directly
by an enemy for the first time since the Dutch
fleet sailed up the Medway. It was the first
direct hostile attack on our country since then!
But under present post-war conditions London
is said to be one of the most vulnerable cities
in the world. If, in these changed circumstances, any great power were to set itself to
undertake the task of maintaining a political
world order-even of so rudimentary a kind
as the nineteenth-century Pax Britannica-out
of its own unaided strength, it would have to
be a power of the continental scale and structure which the United States and the Soviet
Union possess already, and which Japan and
Germany would come to possess if they were to
achieve the great ambitions with which they
are credited in the Far East and in Central
Europe respectively.
A further reference which bears very
directly upon the same matter was made by
the same speaker in the same address, in these
words:
The game of the triangle powers is perhaps
unlikely to succeed. If they do force the world
into a competition for military supremacy,

leaving no choice except conquest or downfall,
then I believe that the victory in that awful
struggle will go, not to those powers, but to
some great power that combines a continental
structure with a command of modern technique
(and corresponding material resources) and
with democratic institutions to give its people
staying power. This combination of winning
points is only to be found in English-speaking
North America.

. . .

But we may be certain

that a British Empire pivoting-as any British
Empire must-on the United Kingdom will not
be in the running in that competition for world
supremacy.
In quoting these words from Mr. Toynbee's
address of two years ago, I am simply bringing to bear on this question now the viewpoint of a well-known, probably the best

NOVEMBER 14, 1940
known, historical student in. the British
Empire, and one who cannot be accused of
attempting in any way to evade the facts or
to reflect discreditably to any extent on the
actions or the historical perspective of any
part of the British Empire.
Finally I should like to add that I, in common with a goodly number of younger people
who have been observing for the last twenty
years the affaire of this country and its relation to the rest of the woeld, have had great
respect for the contributions that have heen
madle in the Houses of Parliament, and outside for that matter, by my right honourable
friend who spoke yesterday (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen). I can recail very distinctly his
visit to London ini 1921, and the contributions
which he madle there ini laying the foundation,
if I may say so, for rnaterially closer relations between the English-speaking part of
this continent to the south of the lie and
the British Empire. I thought then, and I
stiil think, that he was very much on the side
of the angels at that time. It is my sincère
wish-and I know I express the desire and
the hope of many of my friends-that the
future may find the right honourable gentleman devoting his exceptional talents in the
same direction, towards binding more closely
together in common interest the Englishspeaking parts of this world; because I for
one believe most earnestly that the worde
of the Prime Minister, uttered in the debate
on the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne in the other House, to the effect
that this agreement, or whatever you inay cali
it, marks the beginning of a new world era,
were not exaggerated in the slightest degree.

SHIPBUILDING-DISTRIBUTION
AMONG PROVINCES
INQUIRY

Hon. C..E. TANNER: In addition to the
two inquiries of which 1 have given notice,
and to which, of course, I do not expect
answers until after the long Christmas vacation, I desire information in regard to another
matter.
I observe that in a statement which the
Minister of Munitions ancl Supply macle
recently -in another place he said that 181 smail
vessels of from 25 to 27 different types had
been buit and delivered to the Department of
National Defence for Naval Services. It is
intimated that contracts have been let for a
large additional number. In the document
from the Director of Public Information I
notice that there are to be, in ail, 350 of
such ships.
1 wish to be informed of the number of
each type of ship built in each province. We
mnNova Scotia are very much interested in
shipbuildîng, and we want to know whether
or not we are getting a fair share of this work.
Incidentally, we should also like to know
whether the Government has under consideratien the advisability of building wooclen cargo
ships, as was clone during the last war. 1 arn
making no commente.
Everyhody knows
that cargo ships are very much needed to-day.
We expect to sell a large quantity of foodstuifs ancl other goods to Great Britain, ancl
it seems to me we ought to be willing to
provide bottoms for the cargoes, insteacl of
putting on England the whole burden of
provicling the transportation.
If my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurancl) prefers, I will put the question on
the Order Paper. Perhaps, however, le can
hurry up the departments concerned and give
me a reply before the Senate closes this
week.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: There would
le no particular advantage in my lonourable
friencl's placing his question on the Order
Paper. Ris remarks will appear in the
Senate Hansard, and I will bring tlem to the
notice of the Minister of Munitions and, if
necessary, the Minister of National Defence

did, but we feit we had done a good day's
work.
Having affered these consoling remarks, I
move the adjouroment ai the Senate. The

reached us by three o'clock to-morrow afternoon, but if they are not here then we may

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -and I congratulate him on bis success in this particular.
But 1 desire to inform new senators-and
perhaps my right honourab]e friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) himself is flot aware of
the fact-that at its inception in 1867 the
Senate of Canada followed closely in the
footsteps of the buse of Lords. In bis
capacity as chaplain to the Senate, the Anglican Archhishop in Ottawa would enter the
Chamber with the Speaker, and, kneeling by
the table, would in solemn tones say the
prayers, which then were considerably longer
than they are to-day. That was ail the
Senate did each day during the two or three
weeks the Commons were spending on the
Address or on the Budget; but, at any rate,
we felt that we bad done a good day's work
and were somewhat sanctified by the impressive prayers to wbich we listened. When the
Archbishop died, other denominations contended that the Anglican church should not
have a monopoly of the honour, but that it
sbould go round fromn one cburch to, another.
As the dlaims uf the diflerent churches were
pressed somewhat strenuously, the Prime
Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, decided to
settle the difficulty by asking lis Honour the
Speaker to read the prayers; and since that
time, by reason uf the change, the State bas
benefited to tbe extent of £200 a year.

INQUIRY

On the notice hy Hon. Mr. Tanner:
That lie wiM inquire ut the Government:
1. Of the une hundred and eighty-one smaller
types ut vessels which it is stated (see page

290 ut the House uf Communs Debates uf date
November 20, 1940) have heen delivered, what

is the number ut each of the types of sucli
vessels huilt in each of the provines?
2. 0f the une hundred and seventy (or thereabouts) additional smaller vessels ut the samne
type that are state(l now to be under contract,
wvhat is the number ut each type ut sucli vessels
contracted for and to lie but in each uft he
provinces?
3. Is the Covernment considering the advisability ut having wooden cargo slips bujît in
Canada for the purpose ut meving Canadian
products and goods to England?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I bave before
me a lengthy document whicb, I think, covers
must of the questions asked by my bonourable friend. The hunourable gentleman did
nut expect to have an answer befure tbe long
recess, but I shaîl send bim a copy ut the
document which 1 have received fromn the
Minister of National Defence for Naval Services. He writes to me:
I enclose answers to the questions whicb
Senator Tanner bas on the Senate Minutes for
today. The answers have been prepared by
the Department ut Munitions and Supply.
With regard to the question put by Senator
Tanner on Tuesday, December 3, as to "whether
the Goverrument bas under consideration the
advisability ut building wooden car go ships, as
wvas dune during the Jast war," I may say
that in the last war the Goverument did not
build woode~n ships. In the ('ommons Hansard
ut 1918, at page 349, the Honourable Minister
ut Marine (Mr. Ballantyne), said: "It is nut
the intention ot the Canadian Government tu

DECEMBER 6, 1940
have any wooden ships buit. . . . With the
money availabie for shipbuilding in Canada at
tihe present time it seemed te the Government
the wisest policy to invest that money in steel
ships only. "
See also on this point the answer to Senator
Tanner's question 3.
The answer to question 3 is to, be found
on the third page of this memorandum:
The only wooden cargo vesseis unlder consideration at the present time are for British
Admiralty account, about which the Canadian
Government are required te give no information.
I do net know that ail the questions put
hy my honourable f riend, including those of
which he gave informai notice on Tuesday
evening, are answered in this memorandum.
However, he may examine it and let me
know if it gives ail the information, he requires.
I shall hand in the memorandum to be placed
on Hansard.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is clear
that the answer given by the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) covers only the
third question asked, by the honeurabie
senator from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner). It
leaves utterly unanswered the first and second
questions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. But I did
net read ail the answers in the memorandum.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
read by the honourable leader is quite true.
No wooden ships were built by the Government during or after the iast war. Ail that
happened was that steel ships were built,
with the unanimous approvai of the other
House, and after there 'becamne a surplus of
ships throughout the world the Goverament
was accuscd ail over Canada of building
wooden ships, which it had net done. The
answer merely shows the harmful effects of
dishonest political methods. They sometîmes
deceive even the very elect.
I hope that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
these remarks are not applicable to my honourable fricnd fromn Picton (Hon. Mr.
Tanner), who has stated that the Government
in office during the last war did huild wooden
ships.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He is one of
the very elect who were deceived.

SENATE
SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I think my
honourabie friend now lias a copy of Bill 8,
an Act to amend the Special War Revenue
Act. As I have said, the Commons bas made
no changes in the Bill. In fact an officiai. statement to that effect is in the banda of Bis
Honoûr the Speaker. Witb the ]eave of the
Senate, I move the second reading of this
Bill.
As bonourable senators wili see, the main
purpose of this measure is that materiai and
labour which now go into the manufacture of
motor cars may be diverted as mucli as possible to works that are deemed essentiai for
the earrying on of the war. The legisiation
may a]so help to transfer business from the
foreign exporter ta the domestie manufacturer. The increased rates of duty are set
out in the schedule. They may tend to discourage aur people fram purchasing a new car
each year.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourabie members, it need hardly bie said that
I arn in complete accord with the purpose of
the Bill. In fact, montbs ago, I think, I urged
mnside the House, and, 1 amn very certain, outside, a measure of this kind, extending the
impediments ta unnecessary importations and
ta unnecessary purchases in Canada.
I bave bad an apportunity ta compare the
features of the schedule relating ta automobiles with the corresponding features of the
previaus sehedule, wbich is naw suppianted.
What is dane ia mereiy ta accelerate cansiderabiy the taxes imposed, and therefore ta
make more effective what is aiready, in the
higlier brackets anyway, a prohibition.
Speaking for the moment an ane feature
oniy, 1 would point out ithat three-quarters
of the way down the first page of the new
schedule, which appears opposite page 2,
exceptions are made first of customa tariff
items 702, 706, 707 and 708. 1 think it sbouid
be expiained what those items are. I do nat
know. No one knows froi anemory. The
second exception is importation "by a bona
fide settler on a first arrivai." To that no anc
wiii make objectioii. The tbird exception,
though, is "importation by a beneficiary resident in Canada, under the ternis of a wili of
a person dying in a foreign country." 1 do not
know why that exception should be made.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is the aid
achedule. It is taken out.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: Maybe I am
wrong. Are ail these exceptions taken out?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes, aIl tbree.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No, not the
firat.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Two.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Tbe second
and third are taken out. I would not have
objected to the retention of the second, but
I am very much pleased that the third is
taken out. I bad the schedules reversed. In
that case, are not a considerabie number of
articles which were in the old scheduie omitted
from tbe ipresent one?
Hon. Mr. ]JANDURAND: I think amendnients were made ta the resoiutions, but nat
to the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Has the Bill
passed the buse of Commans?
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And the
amendments are not carried into the Bill?
Hon. Mr. DANDUR-AND: In the Bill as
printed, certain items that had been in the
resolutions were inten-tionaliy lef t out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: I canna t
understand how a bill can fail ta foiiow the
resolution on wbich it is founded-a resohution presented ta Parliament under the
authority of the Crown. But suppose for the
moment that objection is removed. Is it not
a fact that many prohibitions which were in
the oId sebedule and appear here in the
scheduie opposite page 2 are not covered?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No.
Righ-t Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Oh, I 8ee.
The new sehedule is on the ieft-hand page,
and the aid one is on the right-hand.
Then those items coming under No. 6 are
new?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Riglit Han. Mr. MEIýGHEN: Many of
theni are very necessary tbings, but no doubt
they can be obtained otherwise than by importation. So I take no exception ta that. We
can afford to deprive ourseives of many new
purchases aiong ail these uines.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND': Yes.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But I arn
bewiidered by the failure 'ta place restrictions
on other things vastly iess necessary than
these. To these restrictions I take no exception wbatever. But why, for exampie, are aur
people atill permitted to expend milions of
dollars for American magazines and sheets of
various kinds? Many of them are-I had
almost said saacious. I object particulariy ta
those that take the most money out of this
country and are exceedingly detrimentai to
the war effort of Canada. I have in mind one

DECEMBER 6, 1940à
paper-I have referred to it hefore-whose
circulation is said to be one hundred and fifty
thousand. If that is a flot uncommon circulation, this class of paper takes out of this
country about $3,500,000. Yet the Goverument cannot see any reason why that money
should be saved to this country or why we
should get the benefit that would be derived
from removing a threat to the underpinning
of our whole war effort.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the other
Bill there is-Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Ail it doe
is give authority to the Minister. He can
do what he likes.

of American exchange as we have. We ean
get along abundantly well without those commodities. In fact, we can get them quite
readily within the radius and, compassa of the
sterling countries-I refer particularly to the
West Indies--and surely we ought to do that.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But a vaat number of magazinesRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I admit that
a good deal of malodorous trash has been
forbidden, and I rejoice in that fact; but soinsthing close to malodorous trash still cornes
in huge quantities. Sometimes I think it
would be better neyer to make any suggestion,
because as sureiy as one is made it is pretty
certain flot to be accepted. I cannot but
believe that if I had just kept quiet the
Goverument would have put the ban on a
lot of rubbish that is comimg ini to-day. Why
we should continue to pay out millions for
papers like the Saturday Evening Po#j when
we are in the position, as adiuitted by this
Bill, of being compelled to conserve not
only such resources of American currency
as we have and can acquire, but also our
.own money, which we need for other purposes in our own country, I cannot iinderstand. Such a course la utterly indefensible.
It would have been indefensible in the last
war, but it is far more so, now. Immediate
and drastic action la essential.,
I observe also that the Government lias
taken care to retain the importation of fresh
fruit. I think we could very well be a littie
less solicitous about our trade relations in
this respect at the present time. We are
buying plenty of goods across the line. We
bought in the year which is ended-I take
the figure from the Commons Hansard, and
I think it is correct-about $516,000,000 more
than we sold; and in the lat three years
about Si1,600,000,000 more. Surely that la
enough. In view of the rate at which the
balance is running against us now, it would
flot be asking too mucli of a nation which
proclaims to the world that it la giving eveiy
help short of war, that it do not insist on
selling us those citrous fruits and taking payment for them from such meagre amounts

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I had time,
I could bring ini a statement of the advantages
we obtain from that convention. Wken it
cornes to legislating against its spirit and ita
letter, my right honourable friend will, I
think, admit that we should consider some of
the desires of the other party to that
convention.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my right
honourable friend think for a moment of the
convention we have with the United StatesRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
vantages we derive fromn it?

-and the ad-

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh-

Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I quite agre
with that. What I said was that it would not
be too mucli to ask. It in true that the
United States would he surrendering somne
of the adivantages of the convention while
we, perhaps, would ibe retaining some that we
have. But that country la getting advantages
to-day away above and beyond the convention, in amounts which are simply staggering
when compared with the meagre results of
the coneention. The sales of munitions are
terrifie, and they are growing in geomnetric
progression. Any country getting those sales,
and proclaiming a policy of "ail help short of
war," would find it pretty difficuit to refuse
our request.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend will surely give credit to the
Goverument for having made the best possible
effort in that direction.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the best
possible effort bas been made and the best
possible done, ail I want to say is--and I
say it with ail the emphasis in my powerit la a long way from "ail help short of war."

Honourable senators,
in the absence of the honourable senator from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) I have
the honour to move the second reading of
Bill B, an Act to incorporate General Security
Insurance Company of Canada.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Would the honourable
senator explain the Bill?
Its purpose is the
Hon. Mr. GOUIN:
creation of an insurance company to which
the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act of 1932 will apply. The activities of the
company, as indicated, are the ordinary activities of such a company-fire, accident and
aviation insurance, and so on. The capital
stock is to be $2,000,000, and the amount to
be subscribed will be at least $400,000. The
head office of the company is to be situated
in Montreal.
I heard the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon.

had been approved by the Superintendent of
Insurance. I think the Bill should go to the

GREAT LAKES-ST. LAWRENCE
DEVELOPMENT
STATEMENT BY TUE PRIME MINISTER

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

Honour-

able senators, I desire to read a statement
which was read by the Prime Minister in
the other House this afternoon. The reading
will bring us to six o'clock, at which time
we shall rise, to return at eight. No motion
is needed for that procedure.
I bave noted the important message which
the Presidenrt of the United States issued
yesterday through Mr. Berle in connection with
a Great Lakes Seaway and Power Conference
which is being beld -in Detroit. The House bas
already been advised through the correspondence tabled on November 12 of the agreement
reached between the Government of Canada
and the Government of the United States,
regarding additional diversion of water for
power purposes at Niagara and the appointment of connmittees to oarry on the necessary
additional eng.ineering investigations in the
International Rapids section of the St. Lawrence. The diversion bas been made at Niagara
and tie power development is being utilized
for Canadian industry. The committees apHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

pointed by the two Governments have been
actively at work in the study and analysis of
the engineering problems in the International
section.
As regards the wider questions involved in
the Creat Lakes-St. Lawrence development, it
ivill be recaliled that the Niagara Convention
of 1929 and the St. Lawrence Treaty of 1932
failed to obtain the approval of the United
States Senate, and that negotiations were later
resumed with a view to the possibility of
combining the projects in a revised single
agreement. Delegations of officials appointed
by the two Governments met in Ottawa and in
Washington least January and -the problems
involved have continued to receive consideration by both Governments. Those negotiations
will be continued. Any agreement resulting
from the negotiations will, of course, be submitted to this House for approval in due
course. I have earlier indicated that any such
agreement on this suýbject would not be brought
before the Canadian Parliament until it had
received the approval of the appropriate United
States authorities.
The Prime Minister added the following
remarks, which may be found in the Commons
Hansard:
As I have already indicated, the committees
appointed by the two Governanents are continuing their study of the engineering problems
in, the International section. They have not
yet completed or reported upon their work,
and no final decision bas therefore been taken
as to the details of the development in this
section. The projeet under eonsideration, as I
stated a few days ago, is a controlled singlestage development, which differs from either
the single-otage development or the doublestage development that was under consideration
some ten years ago. On January 25 last the
following statement as to the character of the
project under discussion was issued after the
conference of officialis of the two Governments:
"The engineering advisers of the two Governments have reached substantial agreement on'
the feasibility and desirability of a project in
the International Rapids section of the St.
Lawrence river which would involve a main
dam in the vicinity of Ba-rnhart island, with a
power bouse in each country, and a control
dam upstream. This project is based upon a
plan which was discussed in se-me detail in
the 1926 report of the Joint Board of
Engineers. The engineers of the two countries
are in agreement that suoh a project is sound
frm an engineering standpoint, cheaper in
cost than the project on which the 1932 Treaty
was based, and affords fulil protection for all
the interests in the various sections of the
St. Lawrence river."
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I am going to take occasion
to say a few words as respects the statement
just read. The purpose of my remarks will
be, not to discuss the wisdom of undertaking
the St. Lawrence development at another time,
but to mark with an interrogation point, as
bold and as visible as I can make it, the
decision to enter upon such an undertaking
at this time. So far as one can observe, the
President of the United States is the power
behind the throne in respect of this whole
venture, and according to dispatches from that

country the urgency of proceeding now is
being based on the ground that in both its
aspects, power and navigation, the project is
necessary for purp oses of the war.
From the standpoint of navigation, I do
not know how it is that we are suffering and
being hampered in our war effort because of
conditions on the St. Lawrence. It would take
a lot to persuade me that the St. Lawrence
development would be the direction in which
to expend our energies and substance if we
were moved only by the intensity of our desire
te, win the war.
Fron 'the standpoint of power, I cannot convince myseif that it is right to enter upon
this venture now. We have, without any
question, a large volume of undeveloped
power. And I do not think I am speaking in
ignorance of the facts if I say that at the
present time we have a large volume of
dcvelopcd -power unsold-not a mcrely meagre
amount, by any means, but large amountsparticularly in the province of Quebec, and
in more than one section of that province.
It might be wise to undertake this venture,
in fact I think it probably would be, if
we had flot extraordinary burdens to bear
at the present time; extraordinary fromn the
standpoint of our finances and of our workers,
our engineers and skilled mechanies of every
kind. But we have extraordinary"burdensburdens so vast it is almost beyond our
comprehiension to, measure thema. One bends
beneath the very weight of the thought of
what stands ahead of us in the way of financial
outlay and of strain on the energies of our
people.
Now, though some engineers may say one
method is better than another, I do not care
wbich you adopt; you could not finish the
job next month, next year, the following year
or the ycar after that. It would be difiicult
to estimate the time requircd, but it would
be years hefore you were through. Under
the plan of 1932, 1 think, the estimate was
seven years. It probably would- have run
over that period. I think it is making considerable demands upon our credulity to, ask
us to believe that something which could
be finished two, threc, four, five, six or seven
ycars from now, by the application of tremendous human energy, the absorption of a
vast number of people and the expenditure
of an almost unprecedented amount of money,
obtained by borrowing or otherwise, would
be a prudent step towards the winning of
this war. One bas to look ahead, it je true,
but instead of Iooking ahead three, four or
five years. it je better to look one yearyes, one month ahead, and just make certain
thcre is flot something else far more vital,
far more pressing than this venture. How

far the Government has gone I do not know,
and I do not know what attitude other members of tbe party to which I belong may
take towards the project, but I know my own
disposition is as I have sought to express
it at this moment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may inform.
my right honourable friend that we shaîl
have many opportunities to discuss this
projectRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Quite 80.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -with fuller
data available than we have before us just
now. It seemed to me that as the President
of the United States had expressed hie sentiments to Mr. Berle, I think in Detroit, it
was but juet that the Senate should be seized
of the statement the Prime Minister made
in the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Quite right.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
WAR EXCHANGE CONSERVATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 9, an Act respecting the
Conservation of Exchange.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not
think that I need enter into all the details
of the Bill wbïch is now before us. It will
suffice, perhaps, to state its objcct, which, as
appears from the title of the Bill, is the
conservation of exehange.
We are ahl aware of the fact that in our
dcalings with the United States there is a
substantial adverse balance of trade again-st
Canada. The purpose of this Bihl is to
restriet importations froim the United States
in such a way as to dimioieh that adverse
balance. If there is a saving of even $6,000,ff00
a month, as has been suggested by the Minister of Finance, there will be that much more
Canadian money available to meet our obligations in the purchases of war materials from the
United States.
There je no doubt that the United States
are being restricted in the advantages they
-have enjoyed under the convention; but it
is quite evident that they are losing nothing,
inasmuch as the savings resulting from the
import prohibition will go to that country to
pay for war materials purchased by Canada.

54

SENATE

I am told, and it bas been stated in the House
of Commons, that our purchases are likely to
increase. We have heard the right honourable
gentleman on the other side state that perhaps more radical steps could be taken to
reach an agreement whereby the United States
would be somewhat more liberal in its dealings with us in order to help us to carry on

and to maintain our exchange in a healthier
condition. Be that as it may. No one knows
what the morrow will bring, but I think we
are moving in the right direction.
Another important feature of the Bill is
the easing up of the restrictions on British
goods coming into Canada, in order to help
Great Britain to procure Canadian dollars
for its purchases in this country. I think the
two objects the Bill is intended to attain are
commendable, and will be accepted by every
member of this Chamber. Of course it may
be that in respect of individual items here
and there the Bill could be improved. However, as a matter of fact, considerable time
bas been given to the study of the measure
now before us by the experts of the Government in the Department of Finance and the
Department of Trade and Commerce. I
would not say it is the last word of the
Government. The House of Commons will
meet again on the 17th of February and it
may be that when the Budget is brought
down certain improvements will be proposed
which will be welcomed.
With these few remarks indicating the
primary and essential object of the Bill, I leave
it in the hands of the Senate. I move the
second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the first part of this Bill
provides for the prohibition of imports from
other than the sterling area and Newfoundland,
for exceptions to this prohibition, to be
determined by the Minister of the department,
and for importations under conditions to be
set out, modified or revoked by the Minister,
as he may from time to time determine. The
Bill also provides penalties for what are
described as undue additions to prices because
of the prohibitions. These penalties are in
the nature of an addition to the customs
tariff, the imposition of the tariff itself, or the
removal of the tariff.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Or of an excise
tax.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Or of an
excise tax. I do not like the broad terms in
which the powers of the Minister are described.
I do not know that it would be any im.provement to substitute the Governor in Council
for the Minister. As we have no power to
amend, or at least have not by our practice
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

actually amended, I do not intend on this
occasion to move an amendment. It does
seem to me, however, that the character of the
exceptions and the reasons for them should
be stipulated by Parliament, and that the
door should not be opened wide for the
Minister to exercise his full and unrestricted
pleasure in approving of such reasons as may
seem to him all right. The individual case
may have to be left ýto the Minister, but the
general nature of the exceptions and the
principles underlying them should be fixed by
Parliament. The Minister should be permitted
to follow only such principles as Parliament
lays down.
Another amendment which I think the
Commons ought to have made to the first part
of the Bill is this: wherever exceptions and
conditions are made they should be tabulated,
and the list laid before Parliament immediately, if it is in session, or at the first
opportunity. No such provision is appended
to the first part at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is there not such
a provision?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One is
appended to a later part; I think, to the
third part. Why there is not one here, in this
first part, we are left to surmise. My surmise
is that it was simply forgotten.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Without having
examined the subject or heard the discussion
in the other House on this point, I should
think that, unless there were exceptional
difficulties in the way of so doing, the Minister
would bring these matters to the attention of
Parliament within the first few days of the
session. He would have to do so on the
Budget, in any event.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know ho
would, and it is probable that he would not
object to an amendment being made in this
House. Personally, I think an amendment
ought to be made, for there is an obvious
omission.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Let us wait
and see how the Act works out between now
and next February, when we shall be meeting
agan.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The second
part provides for a complete

alteration of

customs duties and is designed to the same
end.

It is a modification, item by item, of a

long list of customs duties, the substance of
which I do not think it becomes us to debate.
So far as I can see, there is no need of any
amendment of the second part.
The third part is most important, and on

this I want to make a few comments and

DECEMBER 6, 1940
offer- some suggestions to the Government.
This part is short, and reads as follows:
The Gyovernor dn Council in order to increaise
Canade's supply of foreign exehange may, on
the recommenKlation of the Minister of Finance,
enter i*nto agreemente with individuals, partnerahips or corporationîs to grant assietiance by
way of apeciai tax crediite and/or special a'llowanes for depreciation or deplertion urider the
Income War Tax Act and the Excess Profite
Tax Act, if, in the opinion of the Governcr in
Council, ouoli assistance is necesaary in order
tha-t au expansion of 'the exports of any
individual, partneriuip or corporation receiving such assistance miay take pliace.
1 arn advised by the honourahle leader
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that to this section an
amendmnent, which does not appear in the
prmnted Bill as now before us, was made in
the other House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 think my
right honourable friend
has a copy.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Yes. As I
arn advised by the honourable leader, this
requires.that a report on the actions of the
Governor in Council, in pursuance of section 8,
which is Part III of the Bihl, shahl be laid
before Parliament in due course. The arnendment obviously is riglit, and would be
approved here as in another place.
On this section I want to make certain comnments. First, the power given the Governor
in Council here is simply startling. So wide
is this power that there is nothing lie cannot
do under i.t. He can take any single cornpany
in any industry and make any bargain that
hie wishes with it. For taxation purposes
hie can treat it on a certain basis-relieve it,
or penalize it, according to his own sweet
will-and to that company's competitor across
the street lie can give exactly the opposite
treatment. Whatever lie does will be legal
to the hast detail and could neyer be impugned
or assailed in court. In a word, this section
just places the Governor in Coundil at the
bar and gate of the customs, and tells him:
"Through here will pass ahI the taxpayers of
Canada. Do exactly as you hike with each
and ail." Neyer in our history have we
reposed such power ini the Governor in Council.
But, again, we are in the Senate of Canada,
and this is a money Bihl.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my riglit
honourable friend read the explanations given
by the Minister of Finance?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I could not
read them, because they are not in print
yet. However, no explanation by the Minister
couId alter the words that are in the Act.
flnn. Mr. DANDURAND: I speak subi ect
te correction, but I understand this section is
intended to deal with an industry as a whole.

55

as, for instance, the gold-mining industry, the
încressing of whose production wouhd have a
very valuable effect upon our exchange. It
is not rny understanding that the Minister
ever had ini mind the application of special
treatment to an individual, unless that should
become necessary in pursuance of a general
course directed towards our chief objective,
the winning of the war.
Right Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then the
Bill should be amended to empower the Minister to deal with an industry instead of with
an individual. As it reads now, the Minister
may treat any individual as lie wishes. He
is not required to deal with different gohdmining companies, let us say, in different
ways, but he couhd do that if lie desired:
to one lie couhd offer an open hand, and
to another a chosed fist. There is no restriction whatever upon his actions. According
to what we read in the Press, and Vo my
apprehension of the meaning, the real object
of the section is the giving of assistance
to the newsprint industry. It might have
been wise to set out the industries which'
do a big expert business, and to define the
princîphes upon which. they should be taxed.
Sucli legishation could be defended and may
be necessary at this time. But the measure
now before us places the Minister at the
receipt of customs. It does not do what
the legislation of hast session did--establisli
a board of referees to advise the Governor
in Council how to deal with eacli and every
taxpayer wlio applies for relief. I do not
know that that legishation was mucli better,
yet I think it miglit be assumed that the
board of referees would lie somewhat impartial.
But liere ail the power is given to a Minister
of the Crown, a member of a partisan Government. Psrliament tells him: "Do just wliat
you want with John Smith, paper maker, and,
if you think it advisaible, do just the opposite
to Tom Brown, lis competitor acrose the
street." To the Abitibi Company, whicli is
in liquidation, the Governor in Council can
apply one rule, to Price Brothers another, and
to the Mersey Company stili another. In
every case it is the Minister wlio makes*the
recommendation to the Governor in Council
and wlio is tlie judge. That is not legishation. That is just abandonment, surrender
and abdication of Parliament. You cannot
describe it otherwise.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: By the will of
Parhiament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By the wil
of Parlîsment, among the elected members
of which the Government lias a majority of
three to one. Parliament is made nothing

SENATE

56

but a rnockery. We are called bere to dance
attendance day after day, and wben a matter
does corne before us we are simply asked to
tell the Government it can do what it likes.
Is that parliamnentary procedure? It is as far
fromi it as Hitlerism is from Churchillism. It
is much more Hitlerisma than Churchiliism.
If Part I of the Bill can bc amended, I
should like to see an amendrnient made. I
do flot know whether to urge that further or
net. The Commons might say, "If we permit
an amendment, however acceptable it rnay be,
a precedent will be established aud may give
rise to difficulties later on."
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It bias been done before.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Perbaps se.
If so, it oughit to be done now. And there
should be an amendment to, this Part III.
But on the law as it stands I do want
to bring to bear what study I have been able
to give to it as a resuit of my close association with several oompanies, my more
or less close association with hundrcds of
others, and tbe particular interest I naturally
had in them. 1 do flot see how the preeent
iaw can ever work. It provides that there
shall be a levy of 18 per cent called a
corporation tax, and another of 12 per cent
called an excess profits tax, making in ail 30
per cent.
Hon. Mr.
law.

DANDURAND:

That is the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
,preserit laxv, and I want te say a few words
about it. Then there is a provision that each
corporation shall pay a further tax on excess
profits if its earnings in the year taxedwe will say this year-exceed the average earnings for the preceding four years, the assumption being, perhaps, that tbe increased' carnîngs are due to the war. That additional tax
is 75 per cent of the excess profits, and with
the provincial tax runis in some cases to over
86 per cent, leaving almnost nothing to work
upon. If. of course, earnings run on a pretty
even keel through the yeii-:, owing, say, to the
nature of the business, then this mucb accelerated and tremendous excess profits tax dees
not apply; but in any case 30 per cent must
be paid. To the 30 per cent ne one could
take any exception wbatever. Monev must
be raised, and taxes bave te be paid. But
when yeu cerne te the class of cempanies
which may earn more now than the average
of the four years and you penalize thern
virtually ail their earnings, perhaps because
they bave incurred losses during these four
years-as hundreds upon hundreds of cernpanies bave-tbe result is just as grotesquely
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN

unfair as can possibly be imagined. It just
means tbat in tbe case of a company or an
industry wbich for one cause or another bas
bad te carry on against the greatest difficulties
over past years and bas net been able te make
a dollar, this law compels it. on account of its
past misfortunes, te eternal servitude te the
Government of Canada. Because tbe company
liad tbe werst kind of struggle before, it
is condernned by the law as it stands te
continue that struggle for ever. In short.
the comnpanly is penalized for its own misfortune. But another cempany whose business is of a more stable nature, whicb bas
perbaps been advantaged ever these years hy
sorne fortuitous circumstances and makes but
a trifle more than its average profits, bias te
pay enly 30 per cent. Why tbe distinction?
Do net conclude that if a company makes
more now than it did before, it dees se
because of the war. It may, it is true, but
that dees net fellow of logical necessi-ty. 1
could string off companies whose increase in
profit ýhas net the sligbtest relation te tbe
war. Tbey bad te struggle aleng, but finally
pulled up, and new are in a position te get
their reward for the long years of losses and
trials. Now the Gevernment eûmes in and
takes ail their profits. It is net fair; it is
net right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the application of the Act.

It bas te de witb

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: True, the
Act dees provide tbat if an industry or class
of industry bas been in a depressed condition
it may appeal te the board of referees.
The board bas been appointed. I knew the
chairman vcry well; and one of tbe other
members I ought te know well, because hie
once worked in our fiî'm. Tbe other member
I do net knew. I take ne exception at ail
te the board, ner bave I risen now te comnplain of it. But bew it is ever geîng te performa the task confronting it passes my cernprebiension. The ebairman is a fair-minded
man: bie will do bis utmest. I cannet believe
ho knows what bie is facing. There may be
cempanies which de net intend te corne before
that board, but I de net knew of any; and
a case can bc made before it for alrnost any
cornpany.
If the board intends te bear ail
the cases, ýtben I weuld rather be a member
of the Government than of the board, for I
should have less te do. I de net think the law
will work.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
the board is empewered te examine certain
groups of men in the saine industry who are
facing similar troubles.

DECEMBER 6, 1940
IRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
board has not only to examine the industry as
a whole-and I may say most industries
can show they have been depressed in the last
few years-but under another section it has
to examine the individual companies and see
if they were peculiarly depressed. I wonder
whether the Government has any notion of the
number of companies in Canada. They are
simply legion. I wish the board well, but the
fact is that the legislation is unjust, unfair and
unworkable. The question is: What would
be right? To the 30 per cent tax we cannot
object, but to keep raising the tax, I think,
will do more harm than good.
It seems to me the right principle was
adopted in the last war. The application of
it perhaps could be improved. It ought to
be improved after all the years of experience
we had of it while it was in operation. The
right method is to tax profits on the same
basis and according to the same law and
principle as in the case of income. That is to
say, as the rate of profit increases, increase
the tax. That is what was done under the
old profits tax. If a firm earns 5 per cent,
make it pay a certain percentage; if it earns
10 per cent make it pay more; if it earns
20 per cent make it pay still more, the
percentage growing with the rate of profit.
I do not think any other way is fair. In
that way we shall get the money. You must
have both prerequisites: one, effectiveness, the
other, fairness. I think that method has
both. It certainly is effective.
I have no sympathy with those who would
tax profits at 100 per cent. People will not
work for nothing. Human nature is the same
in war-time as in peace, and instead of helping
the war effort you are defeating it by stripping
people of the stimulus to toil and run their
business right. Leave the incentive, so that
the greater the toil and the greater the
success, the greater will be the reward. You
have to do that. You do not do it under
this Bill. I do not exaggerate at all when
I say I have had business men by the dozen
tell me that they are leaning on their oars:
they have nothing to work for. They say:
"We might just as well take it a little more
easily now, for we are only working for taxes
anyway." You will get that result in any case
if you take away all incentive to work.
Always leave that incentive, let it grow on
greatèr profits, and increase taxes as profits
increase. There is no other way I know of
to get results.
I do suggest to the Government that on
the return of Parliament after the Christmas

adjournment it give serious considération to
amendment of the Excess Profits Tax Act as
it stands to-day. I have not found anyone
who thinks the Act can possibly work in
practice. I know that no one will have anything but pity for a board that attempts
to examine a single industry, hear all its
arguments as to why it is depressed and
should have special treatment, and then come
to a decision as to one concern, then as to
the next, and so on in every case. Unless
the members of the board are supermen to
the nth degree, there will be every imaginable
charge of discrimination, and not one company
in ten will be satisfied. It will be said that
one company has been treated one way and
another company otherwise. I hope the Government will-for the first time-give attention to what I say to-night.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I have just read
section 5 of the Bill hurriedly, and I think
it needs a slight amendment. It says:
Any goods, the importation of which into
Canada is by this Part prohibited shah, unesse
a permit for their importation has been
obt-ained or such gooda have been exempted by
the Minister as hereinbefore provided, be
deemed to be goode the importation whereof is
prothibitedand so on. Surely it is not the intention to
affect goods that were in the country before
the 2nd day of December. Therefore if, after
the first word "goods", these words were added,
"imported into Canada on or after the 2nd
day of December, 1940," goods already in the
country would be exempt. Otherwise I am
afraidRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is not the
honourable member forgetting the exact wording? It says:
Any goode, the importation of which into
Canada is by this Parit prohibitedand so on. The goods may not be prohibited
at all. The prohibition is under section 3,
and does not apply to goods which on or
before the 2nd of December were in transit.
In a word, such goods are not prohibited and
are not within :the meaning of section 5.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I understand very well
the reasoning of the right honourable gentleman, but the two sections seem to be contradictory. Section 5 says:
Any goods, the importation of which into
Canial is by this Parit prohibitedRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If they were
brought in or were in transit before December
2, they are not by this Act prohibited.

cov ercd by section 10, which says:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire to tel]
my righit honourable friend that I hav e hieard
of quito a number of mon who are sorncwhat

Excess Profits Tax Act and who hope that
the referees will take the individual circumstances into consideration.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:

So far as 1

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right hionourable friend said hie had considerable
sympathy with the referees who will have
to try to solve týhese problems, and that he
would rather ho a Minister of the Crown than
a referee. Perhaps ýho will oxcept the Minister
of Finance, because hoe bas bad to stand the
brunt of the recriminations that have been
heard. My right honourable friend knows that
the Ministor of Finance is surrounded by a
group of very able financial men and officiais
who have been app]ying the Customis Act and
the Excise Act. Thoy have been wrestling with
theso difficulties.
My right bonourable friend need not be
under the impression that bis opinions as
expressed in this Cbamber are treated Iightly.
I may tell bim that I will bring bis statement
to the particular attention of the Minister
of Finance. Probably most of the representatiens made by the right honourable gentleman have reached the Minister from, other
sources, possibly the very sources fromn which
My righit honourable friend bas received bis
information. Perbaps between now and Marcb
noxt, when the Budget reaches the Gommons,
the board of roferees, together with the
Department of Finance, will sec if there are
any insuperable objections ta the application
of the Excess Profits Tax Act. If there are,
I should expeet the Minister to apply to

WHARF AT PICTOU, N.S.
INQUIRY

AND

RETURN

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the
Government:
1. What was the cost of the wharf built at
Pictou, Nova Scotia, 1939-1940?
2. What engineering branch of Goverument
planned construction and decided the site?

59

3. Did Canadian National Railways disagree
about the site and propose alternatively that a
breastwork wharf be bujît along the south side
of the railway yard?
4. For what shipping and business reaisons
was the wharf bujît on the site it occupies,
instead of the view of the railway people being
acted on?
5. Was it pa rt of the plan of construction
that the railway rails on the public wharf
adjacent at the west to the new wharf were to
be removed and not replaced? Did the Department of Public Work request the Canadian
National Railways to remove said rails; and,
if so, why? Why are rails not replaced on said
adjacent public wharf?
S6. Is the f act known to Goverument that
since the removal of rails from the said adjacent
public wharf ail luniber and other freights for
shipment fromn said adjacent public wharf have
been moved to and on said adjacent public
wharf by privately owned trucks instead of by
the railway?
7. The Government is requested to lay on the
Table of the Senate copies of correspondence
between the Halifax branch of the Department
of Public Works and persons in Pictou county,
and of correspondence and reports between
said Halifax branch and the Department at
Ottawa relating to the above mentioned matters.
I have an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer for -the bonourable senator frorn
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner), but, as it is quite
voluminous, I would ask that the inquiry be
converted into an order for a return. I now
produce the answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
answer appear in Hansard?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer is
mainly correspondence and
voluminous;
reports.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: There is
nothing in these questions to require a
voluminous answer. It ought to be possible
to state the a.nswer in haîf a page.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can satisfy
my right honourable friend, I thînk, by
reading the answers to the first six questions
in the inquiry. The voluminous correspondence is filed in response to the seventh question. The answers to the first six questions
are as follows:
1. $150,617.10.
2. Chief Engineer's Branch, Department of
Public Works.
3. The Canadian National Railways firat
proposed the construction of a marginal wharf
to the east of the existing east wharf, but,
realizing that the cost would be prohibitive,
they agreed to the site and structure as
proposed by the Department of Public Works.
4. Answered by No. 3.
5. (a) Yes.
<b) No.
<c) The Canadian National Railways e-î
moved their rails because the adjacent wharf

is nlot adequate to meet requirements of
railway locomotives used to-day, and because
the new structure was built purposely for
railway traffic. While flot suitable for railway
traffie, the adjacent structure is suitable for
open storage of such cargoes as lumber, bricks,
billets, molasses, etc., which may be safely
bandled to and fromn the wharf by auto-truck
transportation.
6. Yes.
As I have said, the seventh question is
answered by correspondence and reports. which

6. What was the cost in fiscal year 1939-1940
of w'nges. salaries, maintenance and improvements of enchi national park; and the estimated
cost for fiscal year 1940-1941?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the document
before me containing answers to these questions is lengthy, I move that an order do issue
for a return, which I shall table forthwith.
The motion was agreed to.
FHE LATE O. D. SKELTON, W.* F.
O'CONNOR AND SIR FREDERICK
BANTING
TRfl3UTES

TO THEIR MEMORIES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:

Honourable

members, 1 feel it my duty to inform the
Senate that during our recess the Civil Service
of Canada hias suffered two very serions losses,
which should net pass unnoticed in this
Chamber: the dcaths of Dr. 0. DP. Skelton,
Under Secretary of State for External Affairs,
and Mr. W. F. O'Connor, our Law Clerk.
Both were masters in their own field.
We often hear of the importance of the
British Civil Service, whîch, accomplishing its
daily task silently and auonymnusly. deals
with the vast interests and problems affecting
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

the British Empire ail over the world. The
British Civil Ser-vice lias been viewed, nationally and internationally, as the column of the
Temple. It is always ready te adapt itelf
to the policies, changing according to circunistances, of its Parliament and its executive.
I make bold to say that our Civil Service is,
in its ephere, the equal of that of Great
Brîtain.
A facetions Canadian journalist once said
that when cither Mr. Bennctt or Mr. King
lef t on a mission to Great Britain accompanied
by Dr. Skelton and Loring Christie, hie
enjoyed a certain dcgree of relaxation; for hie
foît that these gentlemen could meet on an
equal footing with Maurice Hankey-later
Lord llankcy-thc bead of the British Cabinet
Secretariat.

It was my privilege more than once to
have Dr. Skelton by my side at Geneva, andi
I had many opportunities of appreciating bis
high mental qualities and wiee counisel. H1e
was modest and retiring. H1e devclopcd on a
sound basis our Department of External
Affaire, which later was to assume such
important functions in international matters.
gathcered around bim assistants who,
wherever they scrved, have done honoîîr to
ou'r country, and hie had good reason to bie

He

proud of bis selections. We shaîl long miss
bis services at the post wbere hie shone so
brightly.
When studying legislation before its coin-.
mittees, the Senate will no longer have tlîe
benefit of the knowledge and direction of onr
Law Clerk, the late Mr. O'Connor. From the
day hie left the university and appearcd at
the Bar of Nova Scotia, Mr. O'Connor had
a very interesting career. Before long hie was
engaged as professor of International Law at
Dalhousie University, his Alma Mater. But
he was soon to emerge in a larger arena. He
started practising law in Toronto, and bis
activities extended to Ottawa, where hie filled
many public offices and hecame the legal
adviser of many Ministers in the drafting of
special and intricate legislation. Hie superiority in that domain was unquestionable. 11e
possessed an exceptionally keen legal sense
and a wide knowledge of both common law
and statutory law, and of their interpretation
by the highest courts of the realm. The
important report which hie made te the Senate

on the interpretation of the British North
America Act bias arrested the attention of
aIl students of our Constitution, and in it
we get a clear insight into bis proficiency. H1e
bad few equals and no superior in the drafting
of legislation and in the critical review of
Acts and Bills snbmitted for jndgment. Every

MARCH 4, 1941
word bad its value, and but one technical
sense, outside of the common usage of the
terni. He was often accused of being too
punctilious because hie hated loose thinking
and expressions capable of a double interpretation. I find it easy to compare hiin on
that score to three men of high standing who
advised the Foreign Ministers of Great
Britain, France and Germany, at Geneva:
Sir Cecil Hurst, M. Fromageot and Mr. Gaus.
I recail an interesting incident to whicb Sir
Austen Chamberlain drew my attention. A
draft resolution from Poland had been submitted to a committee. After perusal it
seemed to be agreea:le to ail the members, and
Sir Austen, M. Briand and Mr. Stresemann
handed the document to their legal advisers,
who were at their elbows. Each adviser,
without consulting the others, handed it back
immediately to his Minister. Sir Austen
showed me thefr action upon it: the tbree
had underlined one and the samne word, whicb
they felt to be ambiguous and capable of a
double meaning. Mr. O'Connor was undoubtedly ini their clase.
It is quite natural that ini these troublous
times we should be obliged to register war
casualties which bring gloom and distress to
many a fireside. Canada mourns the loss
of one of its most highly endowed citizens,
Sir Frederick Banting. The sudden death
of that world-famous Canadian is felt mnuch
farther than hie home circle, and by it
humanity itself is the poorer. Sir Frederick's
medical discoveries have indeed made him a
benefactor of the present and future generations, ;who will pay homage to his genius and
to bis achievements in the relief of heretofore
fatal diseases.
To the familles of these distinguished
Canadians goes our most sincere sympathy.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGRIEN: Honourable mnembers, it is fitting that reference
should be made to the passing of distinguisbed
Canadians, especially those peculîarly associated with this flouse.
I did not have the pleasure of presiding
over a department of which Dr. Skelton was
the deputy or an official. My acquaintance
with bim bas therefore been more casual than
that of ministers in charge of departments in
the last ten or fifteen. years. I have, however,
read bis literary productions-and as welI, by
the way, that of bis distinguisbed wife-and
I can testify to tbe uniform scbolarship whicb
pervades bis work in literature, as doubtless
lit did bis work in the spbere to wbich he later
attained. The Department of External Affairs
has been blessed witb a singularly competent
senior executive for many years, and I doubt

6

not that Canada bas benefited mucb by the
good judgment and industry of Dr. Skelton.
I feel particu larly keenly the loss of my
very close personal friend, a very distinguished
servant of this flouse, Mr. O'Connor. My
acquaintance with bim extends bauk farther,
I tbink, than tbat'of most bonourable gentlemen present. It was my duty to work very
closely witb bim many years ago in difficult
and trying periods, and to make use of services
rendered by bim, strictly as a lawyer and a
draftsman, on many occasions of great importance. I learned then, a quarter of a century
ago, to admire bis industry, the vast scope of
bis legal learning, wbich extended over all or
nearly aIl the fields of law, and bis marvellous
capacity for summoning the most minute
elements of legal lore at but a few hours' or
sometimes only a f ew moments' notice, and
giving an opinion with a certainty of touch
that belongs to few lawyers indeed.
Mr. O'Connor was a man, who had not
developed the practical side as have so many
who bave attained greater success in the
material world. Money meant little or notblng
to bim. Tbe whole cast of bis mind was sucb
that be rejoiced in any difficult intellectual
problem, wbatever it migbt be, not only in
the field of law, but in any field. Not many
are aware, perbaps, that very few men bave
studied tbe wbole system and tbeory of radio
witb tbe tborougbness with wbich Mr.
O'Connor studied it. Hie devoted bours upon
bours to that subject weekly. Nothing that
biis mmnd was attracted to was too intricate;
indeed, the more intricate a subject was, tbe
better be loved it. Neyer, I tbink, bave I
seen bis equal as a man of industry. I have
known. hlm to remain out of bis bed and away
from sleep for as long as tbree nîgbts in
succession, althougb bie was working ahl day
besides. This, perbaps, was not tbe wisest
course for hlm to take, but it indicates the
unselfisb nature of the man: wben bie was
given a work to do, that work bie performed,
and bis own convenience and bealth mattered
not at ail.
I am sure honourable gentlemen who have
served oni our various committees will long
remember how approachable Mr. O'Connor
was. 'He welcomed anyone who came to see
him, particularly if that person wanted bim to
work. Mis hand was outstretcbed ta anyone
who bad sometbing for bim to do aT ta
consider, and bie was tbankful to be asked to
add ta bis toil. It will be difficult indeed ta
replace biin; I fear it will be impossible ta
replace him in this House. I am sure aur
sympathy goes out ta bis widow and the two
daugbters who survive bim.

SENATE

Sir Frederick Banting I did flot have the
honour of knowing so well, but of course
every Canadian and every intelligent observer
of the world of ýmedicine knows who he was and
what he did. His one great achievement made
him famous flot only throughout the medical
world, but also among sufferers everywhere. It
would be very difficuit to measure what he did
in relieving suffering and lengthening life. After
making bis wonderful discovery he devoted
himself to studies along similar lines and
accomplished other things of great value, and
I believe that nlot long before the sad event
which ended bis career he had achieved something more wbich probably is well worth while
and may be of extraordinary value to-day. Sir
Frederick Banting was not only a great
scientist-a great research worker, would better
describe him-but he was a whole-hearted
Canadian. I do not know that I have talked
to anyone since this war began wbo had a more
rounded-out and thorough-going conception of
the onparalleled crisis into whicb late events
have precipitated this country and the world,
or who appreciated more keenly than he the
measure of suffering which this crisis entails
and the fearful agony through which we al]
must go, as well as the unprecedented exertions
we all must put forth bef ore the day can dawn
for us again.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, you will all have noticed that the
Orders of the Day contain no indication of work
to be performed by this Chamber. I thought
I was somewhat bold when on Pecember 6 hast
I moved that the Senate adjourn for two weeks
longer than the flouse of Commons. My
hope was that ini those two weeks the other
bouse would have dealt with some measures
and sent them over to us. I have circularized
aIl my colleagues to inquire whether there
were nlot some bills which could be initiated ini
this Chamber, but in vain. The reason, as I
found it, can be stated in a few words. This
is especially a wvar session, in which the
matters coming before both buses wihl appertain to the war and the financing of our war
activities. These measures must perforce be
initiated in the Commons, and can reach us
only after they have received lengthy consideration and been passed there. They will
be followcd in that flouse by the bringing
down of the Budget. That again, having to
do with increased taxes in many forms, will
naturally give rise to considerable discussion
in the Commons.
I feel we must accept the situation as it is.
Since this is a war session, concerned principally with legfish-ation whicb it is not posRight

Hlon. Mr. MEIGEEN.

sible to initiate in this Huse, I can only
suggest now ýthat after the meeting of the
Ba.nking and Commerce Committ-ee to-morrow
we may have to adjourn again for nearhy
two weeks. I have discussed the matter
with a number of my colleagues-the right
honourable leader opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) first and forermost-and aîl feel
it is as well that we should separate for a
number of days. It may be that even after
such an adjournment we shaîl find nothing
has come from the other side for our consideration. If so, we shaîl either have to
take a further adjournment or wait till there
is sornething before us. Be that as it may, I
simply want to inform honourable members
now that to-morrow we may adjourn for
some days.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I know the honourable
leader of the flouse is stating nothin-g but
the facts in the reasons he has given for a
probable adjournment. I confess to a rather
uncomfortable feeling about the whole situation, for I do not lo-ok forward to our being
of very much use even after we meet. The
bis before the Gommons are almost entirely
money measures, as to which our powers are
small, both under the written constitution
and from the constraint of long practice. All
other arts of the nature of legislation, or
virtually ail, are dýone by Order in Council
under the War Measures Act. From a return
brought down I see that even while the
bouses of Parliament have been sitting no
fewer than 2,600 Orders in Council of the
nature of legislation have been passed. This
makes pretty much a mockery of Parliament.
I do not know what the solution is. The
War Measures Act must be used without
hesitation for many very important purposes,
it is true, but I do think it sbould be used
to a lesser extent while Parli-ament is aitting.
But we are on the horns of a dilemma. If
the course pursued in the past is to be continued, we have not a very large reserve of
usefulness for this country. Nor bas the
Commons itself very mucb. We can exercise

our critical powers, but we do not get a great
deal of satisfaction out of doing that white
the nation is struggling in the grip of a
terrifie crisis, whose extent and potency, and
indeed whose terror, become greater day
by day. If but litthe resuit can be got from
the exercise of our critical function, I do flot
know whether we ought not to take a long
adjournment, and to consider our position
generally.

tion of spending some time here-not rnerely
two days-before the Senate adjourns for a
sufficient period, to enable us to get home
again. 1 amrn ot complaining about the present
situation, because this is a country in which
speech is free and the elected representatives
of the people have a right to express their
views in the other Chamber.
1 have not consulted any of my colleagues
about this matter, but, as I say, there must
have been a general feeling that our presence
ivas necessary here for the carrying on of the
public affairs of this coun.try. Last November we took an adjournment for almost three
weeks, from the 14th of that rnonth, and it
was understoýod that those of us whose homes
are et the extreme ends of the country would
not return when the Senate resumed unless
we received an invitation from the leader of
the Government.
But now we find that
because we did not return in Decemýber we
have had a deduction of four deys' indemnity.
I arrang-ed my business aff airs on the assumption that when the Senate assernbled yesterday
it would continue to sit fro.m day to day in
ordcr to carry on the business of the country,
and I suhmait that the proposed adjournment
is entiroly ton long. 1 arn willing to stay in
Ottawa for a fortnight, but I shail have a very
difficuit time holding myseîf down. Perheps
other senators will have a similar difficulty.
Surely before thet interval elapses there will be
legislation from the other flouse for our consideration. However, in my judgment not
mnuch legisletion shoulid occupy the attention
of Parliamonrt this session; and may I humhly
say t0 those gentlemen on the otlier aide of this
building who cannot hear my voire, that ail we
should be concerned about is the voting of
mioney to carry on Canada's war effort.
Recently when a rnembcr in tlic British flouse
of Commons interjected certain rcmerks, Mr.
Cliurclîill interrupted him and seid, "Let us
,,et ou with the w-ar." I would apply bis
words to Canada. Lot uis in this country get
on w'ith the war-lot us vote money for the
purpose. Even if wo bexe not such full confidence in those who arc in charge of our
national affairs as wo mnight have, still Isay
there is nothing for this Parliament t0 do
but vote money and se encourage the mon
in our Army and Nnvy and Air Force who
are fighting for us overseas. I repeat, in ail
seriousness. that in my viow the proposed
adjournment is far ton long. Indeed, if we
adjourn for three woclcs we rpay encourage
members in the other Chember t0 tak a week
longer. 1 would suggest f0 the honourable
leader of the Government that instead of
the 25tb the Sonate do stand edjourned until
the 18th of this monfh.
Hon.

Mr. DUFE.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

No, nio.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Surely by that date the
other Chamber will have passed the money
hbis necessary for war purposea, and we shaîl
be ready to give our attention to that leislet.ion. Once more I suhmit that -an adjournmoent of thrcc weeks is enfirely f00 long. I
would point out that those of us who corne
fromn Brîitish Columbia and Nov a Scotia, or
even from New Brunswick and Alberta, cannot take advantege of the proposed adjournnment f0 return home. I rney be asked wlîy.
I reply, because to do so would disrupt ahl
the arrangements we made for the carrying
on of our business, in anticipation of a fairly
lengthy affendance here. Let us romain in

xve shaîl be on hand to attend t0 the business
of the country. Last year when we went home
honourable senators from Ontario and Quebec

otlher no legialation is reedy for us, we can

An Hon. SENATOR: Stay in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It is all very well to say,
"Stay in Ottawa." But, as I said a moment
ago, in anticipation of being away from home
for a considerable time, 1, in common with
other members, regulated my business affairs
accordingly. In fact some of us had to stay
up at night in order te straighten out matters
before coming here. I say it is not fair to
ask us to do nothing in Ottawa but twiddle
our thumbs, especially in view of the critical
situation confronting Canada and the rest of
the Empire. I may say that I do not intend
te go home if it is decided to adjourn until
the 25th; I shal stay right here. But after
the 25th I may have to go home to look after
my bank account and try to straighten out
my affairs before the end of the month. It is
not, I submit, fair to the- country or to the
members of this Chamber, who have been at
home since the 6th of December, that the
Senate should adjourn now for another three
weeks, and again I respectfully ask my honourable friend the leader of the Government te
amend his motion by changing the date from
the 25th to the 18th of this month.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Mr. Dandurand, seconded by Right Hon.
Mr. Graham, that when the Senate adjourns
to-day it stand adjourned until Tuesday evening, March 25, at 8 o'clock. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No, no.
The motion was agreed te.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March

CARGO SHIP CONSTRUCTION
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the
Government:
Is the Government of Canada building or
contracting for the building of cargo ships of
steel or wood in Canada on Canadian account;
or arranging to subsidize or otherwise promote
construction of such ships in Canada on Canadian account? And how many of such ships
are te be built, of what tonnage, and in what
provinces?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer I
have is that the Department of Munitions and

Supply has invited tenders for the construction
of cargo ships of steel of 4,700 tons in Canada
on Canadian account. The number of ships
te be constructed has net been determined,
nor has the allocation of contracts by
provinces.
CANADIAN AIR SQUADRONS
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the
Government:
1. What, in terms of aircraft and personnel,
constitute a Canadian air squadron? If establishment is variable, what are the respective
establishments in aircraft and personnel?
2. What is the number of Canadian air
squadrons trained under the Commonwealth Air
Training Plan now in service overseas; and
wh'at are the respective establishments of such
air squadrons?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The questions
put by the honourable gentleman have been
referred te the Department of National
Defence for Air. The answer te both questions is that it is net considered te be in the
publi' interest te divulge this information.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Comnons with Bill 22, an Act for granting
te His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1942.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, we are now
approaching the end of the month of March.
There would be no special haste in bringing
this Bill before the Senate if we had not been
notified that the House of Commons will
adjourn from the 9th of April te the 28th of
April. Honourable members of the Senate
who are familiar with the obligations of
the Government know that the appropriations
for the public service of the current financial
year will come te an end on the 1st of April,
and that if the Bill were deferred te our subsequent meeting, which will net be until after
Easter, it would be too late te meet the
payments falling due on the 15th of April.
That is why I have moved that the Bill be
given second reading now.
The Bill would vote one-sixth of the estimates for the year, that is, 337,725,207.65. It
does not include the supplementary estimates
that were brought before the other House this

the hnsiast men in Ottawa - at the present
time, and while it might ha very dasirable
for us to initiate inquiries along a number
of very important lines, we are bonnd to take
into consideration what effeet that would have
upon ail the varions departments, and particularly upon the chief officers of those
departmcnts and the responsible Ministers.
Now, I have a suggestion to make as to
what might be donc. As bas been said, this
is not a legisiativa session. We are not legislating in varions directions for the good of
Canada; we are dealing with a war situation,
and the whole attention of Parliamant is
focusad on that. This means coînparatively
littie gencral legisiation. This session Parliament is concerned with administration
rather than with legislation for our own
people. My suggestion is this. I do not
think we should take another recess without
at least canvassing tlic situation to sec what
can ha donc, and I would suggcst to the honourable leader of thc Governmen-t that when
the right honourable leader on this sida
(Right Hon. Mr. Mciýghen) is again in his
place, in the naxt day or two, thcy, with
probably the assistance of a small committea,
sit down for an hour or su, and sec whether:
there is flot mnch jîseful work that this flouse
may do when we meet nfter our next adjonrnment. It seems to me that so far as the
public ara concerned, they simply cannot underî,tand why the abilities of a body su-eh as
this, composed very largely of men who have
hiad long experience in public if e and administrative work, shonld not ha used to a much
greater extent.
Let me repent my suggestion, that the two
leaders of the Flouse and snch other members
as they niay choose, consuit togather for some
length of time in order to saa whathcr something cannot ba arrangcd whercby this body
shahl ha made more useful than it appears to
ha at the present time.
I desire t0
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
express the thanks of the Senato to a member
sitting on the other side, the honourabla
gentleman from Montarville (flou. Mr. Beaubien), whio suggcstad that certain work conld
w~ell ha donc by the Senatu. fis suggestion
was examined by a committea appointed for
the purpose, whio made a report. The public
is not absolntely au fait with the effeet of the
work of that committac. I know that sinca
the adjournment the committcc's work has
been continued by my honourable friand, who
bas kept in contact with the rapreseptativas of
the varions provinces as f0 the proper educational pnblicity whiclî shonld bc given
throughout Canada.
I repenat, I desire to
thank him for having taken that initiative,
which is to the credif of this Chamber.

ORDERS IN COUNCIL PASSED WHILE PARLIAMENT IN SESSION

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I refer to
a statement made in this Chamber sbortly
before the adjourniment, that 2,600 Orders in
Council had been passed while Parliament
was in session. 1 asked for some information
as to the nature of those documents, and
this is the answer I have received:
During the periods the Houses of Parliament
were sitting last year (from May 16 to August
7, aud f rom November 7 to flecember 6), the
Governor General in Councdl approved 2,659
Orders in Conil.
0f these, the greatest number (1,947) authorized erntry into contracts of every descriptionThe
purchases, sales, transfers, leases, etc.
axpenditures whielh thase contracts entailed
were covered hy parliamientary appropriations.
The contracts for war supplies f ar outweighed
ail others: they alone totalled 1,447.
A considerable portionî of the remaining 712
Orders in Council concerned departmental
matters, the carrying ont of statutory provisions
hy the Governor in Council, etc. The number
of Orders in Council havisig a specifically legislative charncer was comparatively smal].
I think I should present that statemenýt to
explain why su many Orders in Council were
passed during the session. As will be seen,
they covered contracts and expenditures which
had already been voted by Parliament.
CANAPIAN

AIR SQUJADRONS-PUBLIC
INFORMATION

Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable mcmbers, I suppose I must be content with the
reply made to my inquiry with respect to
aircraft-that it is not in the public interest to
giva certain information. 0f course, I have
no criticism of my honourable friend the
leader of the flouse. Ha simply reads what
someone in the department sends to him. But
it strikes me as rather remarkablc that, at
any rate, that part of the question which
related to the number of air squadrons was
flot answered. Over the radio 'I have heard
the Prime Minister and other members of the
Government state very positively that under
the Commoinwealth Trainiiîg Plan we aie
sending twenty-fiv;e squadrons overseas. Thay
had no hesitation at ail in giving that information. Why, then, the sacrecy about the
matter?
In another place, on the l7th of March,
stnce I put my inquiry on our Order Paper,
the Minister for Air answered it in part by
telling Parliament that we now have overseas
three squadrons, complete in every respect.
Al'though the Minister gave ont that information, some understrapper down in the dcpartment writes, "It is not in the public interest"'
to tell anything about it. This is what the
Ministar for Air said:
We have three Royal Candian Air Force
squadrons of osîr own overseas, ami have had

SENATE

for several moniths. They are equipped, maintained and manued, as to both ground and air,
by Canada.
WXe are pleased to know that. But what
puzzles me is why these gentlemen below
the Minister will net give out any information at ail. I can read in British periodicals
articles telling me of the composition of
British air squadrons. I cani see pictures of
I can
them in the illustrated periodicals.
read about the Australian air squadrons, and
can learn how many planes compose a
squadron. But when we corne to ask about a
Canadian squadron, why, the whole thing is
clouded in secrecy. I wonder if these gentlemen think that the German High Command,
or the German Air Command, are a pack
of simpletons-that they do not know rigbt
down to the last dot how many men and how
rnany aircraft compose a Canadian squadron.
I have no doubt that if I knew Mr. Goering
and wrote to him he would give me full
particulars. These gentlemen in this city seem
to think they must net tell anything for
fear the Germans may learn of it, yet the
Germans know aIl about it. Neyer a ship
leaves the shores of Canada that they do not
know about. There is nothing done they do
net know about. They have a system. But
the people of Canada, who are providing
the meney and the men. are not told anything. I am not blaming my honourable
friend at aIl, but am simply pninting out
that while the Minister tells us something,
someone down in the office says, "We cannot
tell you anything."

received the statement bearing on my honourable friend's 'first question, I read the question
again te see whether the Senate could net
be given some answer wbich would satisfy
my bonourable friend. I wrote te the Minister
hirnself, drawing his attention te the matter,
and I received a reply stating that the
answer was absolutely in conformity with bis
own view and could net be changed. I will
now ask my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) te translate for
the lionourable senator from Pirtou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) this letter frern the Minister for
Air, who writes te me in French.

CANADA'S

NATIONAL

HEALTH

MOTION

Hou. ARTHUR SAUVE rnoved the followng resolution:

MAROR 26, 1941K
1. Whereas the strength of the nation depends
especially upon the health of the Canadian
people;
2. Whereas the object of every effort, either
individual or social, "is life it6elf, its preservatien and development",;
3. Whereas in this period of war, anguish
and excess, it is ail the more urgent to prevent
disease by protecting and fertifying health;
Therefore, be it resolved that this House
respectfully recommends that the Departmnent
of National He.alth of Canada do:
(a) deal more severely with the elements
detrimental. to health, especiaily with the
increasing misuse of broadcast advertisements
recomimending panaceas or certain commercial
articles of food and drink;
(b) see that the danger of the abuse of
unsuitable foods and beverages be taught widely
by the press and the radio and in scbools;
(c) spread knowiedge of the properties of
wiiolesome foods and beverages.
H1e said (Translation) : Two years age, in
this Chamber, I suggested. that the Senate

should, while awaiting legislation from, the
House of Commons, avoid or attenuate as
much as possible the bad impression created
by frequent and often misunderstood adjournments, by discussing motions on academic
subjects having to, do with the vital interests
of the nation.
In accordance with this proposal, I have
the hencur to introduce the motion which, is
now before you.
Not being a physician, a physiologist, nor a
specialist, I have flot the slightest idea, cf
delivering a lecture te my honourable colleagues, and certainly net to, those whose pro-fessional knewledge and experience have made
cf thçm recognized experts.
My motion is within the province cf legislators who have the power and duty to,
proteet the human being from the cradie to
the grave by seeking te place him in a position
progrcssively te develop and use "his potential
capacities, intellectual as well as physical and
moral."
To those who may doubt this I would
recommend the reading cf the final report
cf the League cf Nations' mixed committee
on nutrition in its bearing upon health, agriculture and cconomics. They will find that
nutrition is a physiological, economie, agricultural, industrial and commercial problemn

which dlaims the interest cf ail the parliaments
of the world. In mcst countries tariff policies
take into account the need cf rational nutri-

tien. The legislator should therefore associate
himself with the physician with a view te
protecting the human being against ail contamination and preparing vigorous and wellhalanced young men and women capable cf
intellectual development and the acquisition

of a properly rounded education.

In a study cf the conditions and problemis
cf the country, Thomas Adams, adviser te

the Federal Conservation Commission, said:
To conserve human resources ineans te
increase the quantity and quality cf human
activity applicable to production. To diminish
social evils and dangers te, health is te prevent
the waste cf what we have sud te make it

for
possible te se vital tefuture development....
Nothing is plan
the interests cf Canadian

production as the conservation and deveiopmient
of human life. The advantage cf a natural
growth
growth cf population, as opposed tehas been
frmoutside that is by immigration,
recognized tiîroughout the centuries.
It has
also been demonstrated by the investigations
cf the Conservation Commission.
The race te, which I belong is a living
example cf this, since. it owes its survival. te
the fecundity cf its homes. This fecundity,
though weakened by modern ways cf life,
stili serves te compensate for deficiencies elsewhere.
The two great races rooted ini the constructive traditions cf the country have a
particular and vital interest in arming themselves against the pernicious elements which

threaten te dimînish still more, te, weaken
or te, destroy, their families. And is not
health the motive power 'of the familysound, robust, well-nourished health at the

service cf an enlightened mind?
Science and experience have shown that the
chief secret cf health and cf its prolongation
lies in wholesome nourishment.

In his preface

te Miss Michelle Gosselin~s excellent treatise
on rational nutrition, Dr. Henri Gariépy, the
emmnent specialist in charge of the departmnent
of nutritional diseases at Notre Dame hospital,
speaks cf nutrition as foilows:
It makes it possible for us te teach everyene
what he should eat in order te grew and develop
normally, te get the full benefit of his organs,
te prevent their premature wearing eut and
te delay the infirmities of age. Nutritional
hygiene, the basis cf preventive medicine, is
derived freim our knowledge cf normal nutrition.
Wle live in a beautiful country. The pure
air~ cf its great spaces and the abundant
variety of its choice foodstuffs are sources
of health whi.ch we should prize te a greater
extent than wc have d'one, as valuable assets
and inestimable privileges.
The object -of my -motion is net se much
te criticize the govemnmental authorities as
to set forth facts indicating cur national
weakness in tolerating a misuse cf advertising
tending te pcrvert the education cf the people.
It wGuld be unjust and foolîsh te deny the
progres made in the field cf nutrition in
Canada, both hygienically and socially; but
this progress bas net been proportionate te the
facilities offered by the development of the
science of nutrition.

caused by faulty nourishment of the mother.
Is that not one of the conseqµences of a
defective or incomplete education?
It is forbidden to kill one's neighbour, to
cause his killing or to let him be killed. The
law prohibits the carrying of arms without a
permit. But what are the authorities doing to
check the murderous elements which are
poisoning the food of our young people?
Improper nutrition takes more lives than firearms do.
When physicians point out the danger, what
answer does the Government give them?
Where is there effective co-operation with
the medical profession.? What are our rulers
doing? What measures are they taking to
combat the lies and the perversions of liberty,
which are the chief weaknesses of modern
democracy?
Again, I disclaim all intention of accusing
our governments of inaction. That would be
showing either ignorance or bad faith. What
I want to point out is that our governments
have not obtained from their health organizations the results which the people need more
and; more urgently. It is al very well to
have technicians and statisticians, but they
should be high-souled and vigilant. Scientists
and analysts, yes, but also apostles, active
propagandists properly equipped and in intelligent contact with the people; publicity tending
to popularize nutritional science, not solely
for commercial purposes, but above aill for
the salutary education of the Canadian people.
The weakness of our educational policy is
also due to false economy on the part of
government. Excellent plans have been drawn
up, but insufficient money has been provided
to carry them out.
I do not wish to preach pessimism or to
pose as a Puritan. I am no extremist,
although I consider extremism sometimes
necessary to the establishment of a happy
medium. It finally leads to moderation. I
wish to denounce an evil which is daily
spreading before our eyes, an evil noticed by
everyone and deplored particularly by the
maturer people. It is the duty of men of
experience and responsibility to combat this
abuse.
To the natural water which God had made
indispensable to all beings, modern civilized
man is pleased to prefer aromatic beverages
and, still worse, drugged, narcotized beverages
which are injurious to his health. The beneficial effect of the oxygen, hydrogen and
nitrogen present in water is destroyed by
artificial substances designed to further the
aims of commercial exploiters. Thus, our
perverted education makes people prefer death
to life.

71

Milk is defined as "a food containing in
the right proportions all the substances required for the maintenance and repair of the
tissues." Milk is indispensable, particularly
for children and adolescents. But what do we
see? Young girls breakfasting on a glass of
toxic beverage, which acts on the heart and
the nerves, and toasted white bread or cake,
while slowly inhaling a cigarette or two, letting
the smoke pass through the brain and out
of the nostrils. Mothers of to-morrow, please
read "The Poison Trail," by Dr. Boos, a
specialist in toxics, and you will see the
consequences of your disregard of the rules
of health.
The other day, on the train from Montreal
to Ottawa, a distance of about 110 miles, I
saw three young soldiers drink three bottles
each of one of the most advertised and overindulged in of the popular beverages. Yet
there was at hand excellent drinking water
obtainable without cost. I have noticed many
other lamentable occurrences. I could mention harmful practices due to a lack of education or to the caprices of a perverted
education.
What is the unfortunate consequence of this
state of affairs? The millions of dollars that
Canada spends in vain to protect its people;
a slight, but totally insufficient, improvement
in the total number of deaths, which, however, is still far too high in a country having
such a salubrious climate and such an
abundance of highly nutritive foodstuffs. This
total is not at all proportionate to the progress
made in sanitary science. It shows rather
misuse on the part of the people and lack
of leadership from the authorities. Should
the State not react more effectively against
this social and economic evil?
The true remedy lies in educating the people
through popularizing the science of rational
feeding and in proper living. This education
should be given in the elementary schools,
in the Press and by the radio, but with full
efficiency and a firm and constant desire to
attain the objective aimed at, that is to say,
the thorough instruction of the people in
matters of health and their entire submission
to the laws enacted for their protection.
There are on our teaching staffs and in our
hospitals persons thoroughly versed in the
principles of hygiene. But are they in a
position to communicate their knowledge
effectively to the people of the country
through well-trained school teachers conscious
of their du-ty and of the needs of the people?
I think not. Therein lies our chief weakness.
How many rural school teachers between the
ages of 18 and 23 are able to give this kind
of service? How many school principals?
Certainly. there are noble exceptions. But

SENATE
the school mistress wholly intent upon her
task is likewise an exception. She is usually
there only temporarily, subject to the will of
a school board, while fondly awaiting the
home for which she feels naturally and deservedly destined. She should not be blamed
for that, as her stock of knowledge will serve
to make her home more pleasant and enlightened.
The most effective means of popularization
are the Press and the radio. The Press can
be particularly useful in the matter by
publishing lucid, attractive articles written.
by physicians who know the subject thoroughly, as, for example, the articles of Dr. Adrien
Plouffe published in certain Montreal newspapers.
The Canadian Broadcasting Act and the
regulations governing transmitting stations
aimed at maintaining and raising the standards of Canadian broadcasting. This is referred to in the report of the Minister of
National Health, page 122. But as this Act
contained no provision relating to misleading
advertising, it was amended in 1929 (sections
32a and 123) in order to provide that the

actors who are specialists in commercial
publicity. It seems to me that some of these
"sketch" artists would be more useful under
the direction of physiologists employed by
the State to broadcast the science of rational
nutrition and make of it the mistress of
household science.
I respect these actors.

by suggestion to believe themselves sick. The
announcer often assumes the role of a physician. I have no objection to the advertising
of the quality of a product, but I ain
distinctly opposed to the announcer assuming
the role of the doctor or the physiologist for
the purpose of recommending patent medicines, beverages or foods as cure-alls.
Ever since the studies of Hopkins, of
Cambridge University, on the essential need
of vitamins, rational nutrition has progressed,
but not so much as if it had had a larger
number of apostles, of propagandists to introduce it and popularize it.
It is not enough to point out that a committee
of the League of Nations has
established a biological standardization of
vitamins; the chief need is to make the
people understand what a vitamin is, and
what are its qualities and its effects on various
constitutions.
In her treatise on rational nutrition, the
most if not the only really useful one in the
province of Quebec, Miss Gosselin very
sensibly says:
It should be possible to draw up a programme
of education in nutritional hygiene suited to
our mentality and our means of action.
She suggests that a committee of experte
be appointed to study scientifically and systematically the problem of the better utilization
of food products of the province of Quebec
and to establish the advantages. of teaching
rational nutrition. She suggests also that
this teaching be given in the elementary
schools, the high schools and the universities,
with post-graduate courses especially intended
for housewives. Miss Gosselin made these
suggestions late in 1939.
Quebec is not the only province in need
of this teaching, as we can easily see by
reading official reports and observing the
habits and health of our people in general.
As the honourable leader of the Government
well knows, the Quebec authorities have
given particular attention to the question of
health and of household science. He attended
one of the many conventions held in our
province, where he delivered a highly-praised

speech.
(Hon. Mr. David), whom I am pleased to
sec here, showed a special interest in these
questions when be was Provincial Secretary.
It is not they, therefore, who would deny
to this House the right, the power and the
duty to deal with the vital problem of
nutrition in this country.
Should my motion contribute in the least
to an improvement of the situation, I should
be most happy.

Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE (Translation):
Honourable senators. first of ail, I wish to
thank the honourable member wbo lias just
taken his seat, for liaving so cleariy established
that, after ail, this Chamber lias some potential utility and is capab-le of dealing witli
the great social questions which concern the
entire nation. I frankly admit that I littie
expected that my honourable friend from
Rigaud, who is a professional journalist,
would make such a fine exposition of a subjeet witb whicb he miglit be more familiar.
Nevertbeless, I congratulate him on having
succeeded in proving the points lie lias advanced. 1 compliment him on tlie valuable
data lie lias gathered and on lis liappy
choice of tlie autliorities wliose opinions lie
bas transmitted to us.
Reverting to wliat I liave just alluded to,
I must say tliat I liad myself intended to
raîse, in a similar way, anotlier question of
more immediate and practîcal interest. I
may do so before long, if the opportunity
occurs. I shahl briefly mention the question
now, in order to justify my bringing it up.
I desire to refer, lionourable senators, to the
post-war .problems. 0f course, we are al
agreed that the first need is to win tlie war.
However, I arn not alone in tbinking tliat
we sliould exereise ail tlie foresiglit and proper
prudence possible, in view of the general
disorder wliich 'will possibly and even probably follow the present confliet. Tliis tbought
lias inspired, not only in Canada, but also
in neigbbouring countries, expressions of
opinion regarding tlie post-war problems. In
fact, it is our bounden duty to try to foresee,
in se far as it is possible to do so, the results
whicli will follow in every domain. I think
I can quite properly connect this idea witli
the magnificent exposition by my lionourabie
colleague from Rigaud.
The question of nutrition was yesterday, is
to-day and will be to-morrow one of tlie most
serious problems in ail the countries of the
world. Wlien tlie presént war, wliicli is tlie
greatest instrument of destruction, cornes to
an end, we sliall liave to tbink of tbe indispensable feeding of tlie various populations
affected. Tben we shal liave to provide for
the essential needs of the nation. Tliis is a
law of compensation im-posed upon us by
Providence.
I intend to be brief. I rose simply to
move tbe adjournment of the debate on this
motion, because it is My duty, as it is tlie
duty of ail honourable senators belonging
to the medical profession, to take part in it.
We are entitled to a little time in wliich to
gather tog-etlier facts and evidence pertinent
to the subject.

I shail, liowever, take the liberty of referring
at present to the very intelligent and practical
initiative taken not very long ago, and
inspired by our famous unempioyment situation, wben, as lionourable members aIl know,
family allowances were often inadýequate for
the essential needs of the liouseliold. The
Canadian Medical Association published, some
three years ago, a pamplilet containing some
very practical advice on rational nutrition,
wliich, won tlie approval and -tlie co-operation
of tlie life insurance companies. In fact,
these companies took upon tliemselves, in
great ýmeasure, te distribute tliis pamplet
and even used it in tlieir advertising. This
initiative had a doubly beneficial result,
inasmucli as it not only tended to promote
nutritional bygiene, but also contrihuted to
lessen the waste occurrîng in so many bornes.
I now bave the bonour to move tlie
adjournrent of tlie debate till Tuesday next.
The debate was adjourned.

had studied the principles of political economy
and gave us a number of interesting discuorses on that science. H1e also participated
in our debates on utlier questions, and regulirlv atteodicI olir committee meetings, taking
zin activeo part in aIl our work,.
In latter years we hteard an eclho of bis

of his Church and a conýtaiîf stuthent of the

inanýs estrangernent from Christian teachings,
and that his onhy hope of saivation iîuy in

lit 1925 lie became a

lias been une of myculleagtics boere. Se 1 got

His convictions woro. as the benourable senaf or
wlio leads this Houso bas said, very firmn and

sce aIl knonw%, a s crv firm partisan and an un-

M\,ARClï 26, 1941
wavering follower of the Liberal faith. I told
hirn once that I had no great difficulty in
convincing hlm, but extreme difficulty in
getting his vote.
We had an insight into the mind and into
the very character of the honourable gentleman in recent years. lis views on reliious
matters hie nover hesitated to expound. In
such matters, which really comprise the
reaction of the human mind te the rnystery of
life, ho had no doubtings, no questionings. Hie
was basic and fondamental: te him the Bible
-every verse, every lino and every letterwas the Eternal Word.
In the province from which hie came hie was
a personality thoroughly well known and universally esteemed. Ho livod te a grand old
age. for soon he would have been eighty-five.
He had political reverses, but over the range
of years his life was a succosaful one. Any
man who has served in both buses'of Parliament for no less than thirty years must have
gifts which commend him, and such gif'ts
Senator Hughes possessed. As the years passed
we understood hlm botter, and bis character
seemed to mellow. I arn sure we on this sido
ail lament, as do honourable gentlemen opposite, that hoe will be with us no more.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, as a colleague of the late
lamented Senator Hughes, coming fromn the
same province and having beon bis deskmate
for some years, I deem it not out of place
that I should attempt to fill in the splendid
outlines of the charneter of the lato senator
given by the leader of the flouse and the
right honourable the leader opposite. I think
that perhaps with one exception, the honourable mrember from Cardigan (Hon. J. A.
Macdonald), I knew the late Senator Hughes
longer than did anybody else in this House.
The honourable sonator froma Cardigan lived
only a fow miles from him, while I lived a
good many miles to the westward.
The late senator entered -public life in
1900, and wvas a candidate at every federal
election until 1930. In 1904 hoe fad as bis
opponent the late Hon. John McLean, for
many years a member of this flouse, whom hoe
defeated. In the election of 1908 hoe had his
one real defeat in bis long political career, bis
opponient being Mr. A. L. Fraser. who suhsequently was appointed County Judge. True,
in 1917, although ho had a magnificent
mai ority, hoe was not able to take bis seat in
the flouse of Co-mmons, the switching of
soldiers' votes precluding him from doing 80.
To show bis popularity among bis own people
I may say that when the Liberal party went
down to defeat in 1911 Senator Hughes was
elected with a good mai ority. He was the first
14879-64

mayor of Souris, and always took an active
part in anything relating to civic welfare.
He was a great worker, and very well known.
His career in the House of Commons was
contemporaneous with those important events
in Canada's history, the building of the Transcontinental Railway and the caming of the
now Western Provinces into Confederation..
He had a very successful career as a
When ho was in the House of

in Souris, and five branches scattered throughout the county. He found, however, as many
others do, that to engage in politics was net
a paying proposition; so hoe decided to concentrate bis energy and consolidate bis capital
by confining bis business te Souris.
At twenty years of ago ho was a bank clerk
in Halifax. Eight years aftorwards ho was
appointed manager of the Merchants' Bank,
of Prince Edward Island.
One of the speakers who preceded me montioned that Senator Hughes was a very strong
believer in bis political and religious faiths.
It was my privilege te talk with hiým many
times in my room, or in bis, and, though on
some matters we agreed to disagree, 1 welI
remember the happy consummatien of a
certain piece of legislation introduced by him,
which must have given great satisfaction te
him, as it did te me. Honourable Senator
Hughes, as perhaps very few realized, had a
fine sense of humour. Many a time' ho told
me of bis political experiences in such an
inimitable way as te keep me in roars of
laughter.

CANADIAN

AIR SQUADRONS-PUBLIC
INFORMATION

Hon, C. E. TANNER: Henourable mernbers, hefore the Orders of the Day are (alled
I should liko te tako a few minutes toe ornphasize a bit of information wbicb, te my mind,
is in very heartening contrast te the secrecy
that enveoped us yesterday. I arn sure that
if my bonourable friend the leader of the
lieuse bias net already observed this informatien bie will hoe much .pleased te hear of it, as
will boneurable mombors ef the House generally.
Yesterday I found it nccssary te quete the
Minister of Defence for Air hby way of a
rehuke te one of his suberdinatos. Personally I bave a great admiration for the Minister of Defence for Air-a feeling that I
believe is very general.
Some lien. SENATORS:

Hear, boar.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: 1 think nearly everyone bias admiration for him and is confident
that hce is making a vcry scrieus and succossfui effort te take up the slack of the Commonwealth Air Training Scheme.
It is my
observation that bie is a man who, wlien there
are difficulties, is flot afraid te tell about
tbom. On the ether band, wben thore are
geod tbings te tell, bie tells about them tee.
There is ne secrecy about him.
I was deligbted te-day when I picked up
the merning paper and read about a speech
bie had made in Teronto last night. I arn
net geing te read the wbole speech, but 1
wisb te emphasize it.
The Minister was
speaking on bebaif of the War Services Campaige, and bie is reportod as saying:
If, as w e read iu the priess over the wýýeek-end.
there wiffl ho 20,000 Amorican aircraft delivered
te Britain withini the next fifteeu or eighteeu
months, overy one ef thern and more will be
rnanned by graduates of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.
Then lie added:
W.e']l sond thern pilots te handie them,
observers te nav-igate thomi and gunners te
flght them; and I amn confiden t that when they
reach Britaiiu hy their thousands they will
sweep the enemy net only fromn the skies of
Britain, but of Europe.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: AIl I want te add is
that that is the kind of information te send
Hon.

Mr. MACDONALD.

ovor te Mr. Hitler; that is the kind of talk
Iliat beartens the people of tbis ceuntry, the
people of Great Britain, and of the Commonwealth gonorally, and net this stuif about
secrocy.
That is the kind ef talk Lord
Beaverbrook gives the people in England.
Wben hie was broadcasting the other nigbt
lie told the xvorld that Britain had aircraft
stored in every part of the British Isles, and
lie was net afraid te tell the Germans bow
she had produced, and had ready for flghting,
five new types of aircraft of the most modern
kind. That kind of thing, and reliable information sncb as Mr. Power gives eut, are
just wbat the people want.
May I sav just a word about aircraf t? 0f
course, the Minister for Air cannot make
progress until hie gets training aircraft. Wo
ail know that the production of such equipment
baýd hoggedl down very badly. I rornember two
or tbroo speeches by Mr. Power, one dolivered
in Montreal andi another up bere, in wbich
hie complaîned very bitterly and openly about
net being able te get planes. The situation
is better new, tbougb. During tbe recess I
read reams of speeches delivered in anotber
place, but I was unable te find eut fromn tbemn
.just w-bat wve were producing in the way of
aircraft. However, a few days ago I received
the report of a meeting of sharebolders of
tbe Canadian Car and Foundry Comnpany, and
I saw that the president of the company
had stated in his address just what they were
doing. It was a very heartening statement
te read. Hie said tbey had had a contract
for forty Hurricanes, every one of wbich bad
been built and delivered. Hie did net mention
wbother deliveries had been made on schedule
or net; bie sirnply remarked tbat the machines
bad been finished five montbs ahead of time.
And hoe went on te say that the company
now lias anoth 'er contraet, from the British
Goverument, for 560 Hurricanes. The cempany are making these eut at tbe head of
the Lakes, I tbink. and tbey are doing well
on thorm. I could nover got any information
like that fromn speeches mado in the lieuse
of Couirnons. Wby sbould this be se?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend apparently missed the speeches of the
Hon. Mr. Howe.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Wbon it cernes te
stating facts. Mr. Howo is a groat evader.
I think hoe takes first place in that way.
lIon. Mr. LACASSE: How?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: However, two or
three days ago I did get some further valîîable
facts about our aircraft production. But I
got these from a newspaper, the Montreal
G1azette. of last Saturday, I tbink. Mr. Ralph

MARCH 26, 1941
Bell, Director General of Aircraf t Production,
who happens to be a well-known Nova
Scotian, con.voyed a party of newspapermen
to Montreal and took themn ail over the three
aircraft plants down there. Re talked ta the
newspapermen freely and openly, and the
Gazette published what lie said. He explained
difficulties with which the plants had at first
heen confronted, and 1 think this was a very
proper thing for hlm to do. Later he dealt
with the situation -as it is at present, and stated
we are now producing 180 aircraft per month.That is the first time I ever saw any such
statement; nothing like that was ever given
in any speech in the House of Commons.
He further announced that within a very short
time a two-engine bomber of large calibre
would be in production. These are very
pleasing thinga to read.
1 repeat, honourable senators, it is facts
we want. Let us face the facts, whether they
are good, had or indifferent.

MARCH 27, 1941

which is now before us in the form of the Bill
I am presentingwse have had regard to the following factors:
(a) The physical capacity of Canada to
produce equipment and supplies for ourselves
and Britain;
(b) Our consultations with the British Government as to the forms our effort should take
in order to make the most effective contribution
to the joint cause; and
(c) Our belief that the Canadian people desire
that this country do its utmost, and that they
are willing to make the sacrifices and bear the
burdens which such an effort involves.
To finance the programme that has been
developed on the basis of these considerations
we have decided to ask Parliament for a war
appropriation of $1,300,000,000 for the coming
fiscal year.
The war programme . . . will involve a total

estimated expenditure in excess of this sum by
perhaps as much as $150,000,000. But, as the
flouse will realize, there are very great difficulties in making precise estimates of war expenditures. In particular, there are at least three
factors
which
make
accurate
estimates
impossible.
First, there is the impossibility of calculating wastage of equipment and the amount
of ammunition that will be used, as this will
depend upon the nature of the warfare that
develops.
The second factor has to do with the capital
assistance which bas been given to manufacturing plants through the Department of Munitions and Supply. Large sums of money have
been advanced, and additional sums will be
advanced, to contractors to pay for adding to
their plants or to build new ones. Additional
sums will be advanced to provide working
capital. In many cases Canada and the United
Kingdom are making advances on a joint basis,
but in some of these cases the division between
the two countries has not been settled. In the
meantime the money has been put up in order
that there shall be no delay; the division will be
worked out later.
A part of these advances may be returned
during the course of the year, but this cannot
be determined now. Furthermore, a portion
of the amortization cost of the capital expenditures resulting from such advances may be
included in the cost of the equipment which
is included in the estimates of the Department
of National Defence. If this is the case there
may be some duplication . in the amounts
included in the estimates of the Department
of Munitions and Supply and the Department
of National Defence. At this stage it is
difficult-impossible, I should say-to determine the extent of such duplication, because
the costs of the equipment which is to be
produced are themselves based on estimates.
The accuracy of these estimated costs will
depend to a considerable extent upon the
quantity of equipment which will be produced.
The third factor making for uncertainty
in estimating is the question of the amount
of war materials and equipment which can
be physically produced and delivered within
the coming fiscal year. Estimates have been
made of the probable deliveries, and I assume
that the Minister of Munitions and Supply
(Mr. Howe) will be discussing the whole
question of the production programme at the
proper time. It will suffice if I say that this
programme is dependent in certain important
aspects upon the delivery of machine tools
and parts from the United States. If there

79

should be delays in such deliveries the completion of the equipment in question will be
held up.
In view of these various uncertainties I
thought it preferable not to ask at this time
for the total of the estimates which have been
submitted. Instead, as I have said, the Bill
calls for an appropriation of $1,300,000,000.
It may be that the total cost of our war
effort expenditures during the coming fiscal
year will exceed this figure by a considerable
amount, and if it does it will be necessary
for me to come back for an additional appropriation at a later date.
However, in determining the magnitude of
our total war effort we must not overlook
another burden which Canada has assumed.
I refer to the assistance which we are giving
to the United Kingdom in financing the war
materials, equipment -and other supplies which
are being produced for the United Kingdom
in Canada. During the first eleven months
of the war we made available to ber 184 million
Canadfin dollars by our repatriation programme; that ,is, by buying in or paying off
anadian securities which were held in the
For the succeeding six
United Kingdom.
months' period ending January 31 of this year
we agreed to provide $150,000,000. We have
done this, and indeed by the end of this
month shall have provided an additional $137,000,000 by accumulation of sterling which, in
part at least, is in anticipation of repatriation
to be carried out in later months of the year.
I cannot now estimate the total amount which
we shall be able to do for the secdnd full
year of war or for the fiscal year 1941-42, but
I can say that We are following the policy of
going as far as it is practically possible to go.
While repatriation involves the repayment
and thus will
indebtedness,
of foreign
strengthen the economy in the long run, it is
obvious that to-day it imposes additional
strain on Canada by increasing the amount
ber people must save in order to purchase the
securities which are being returned to this
country. For practical purposes, in considering
the burden which is to be placed upon this
country it is just as much a part of our war
effort as the expenditures which we propose
to make on our own account.
All the securities that have been repatriated
by or on behalf of the Canadian Government to
date have been Government or Governmentguaranteed securities.
The Minister was asked by an honourable
member: '/They are being cancelled, then?"
He replied:
Yes; they are not going on the market. There
are industrial securities which are being placed
on the Canadian market by the United Kingdom directly, in very much smaller amounts.
If we assume that we shall be able to provide
assistance in this way to the extent of, say.
$400,000.000-I am speaking about repatriation
still-and if our direct war expenditures do not
exceed the $1,300,000,000 which the present
resolution asks Parliament to appropriate, we
get a total of $1,700.000.000 as the financial
measure of the burden of our war effort. If
we add to this total the non-war Dominion
estimates of $433,000.000 and nrobable provincial
and municipal expenditures of, say, $575,000,000,
we get a total of over $2,700,000,000 which
governments will have .to raise from the Canadian peonle during the coming fiscal year. We
fet talking of these hundreds of millions and
billions, and after a while some of us lose our
Rense of the imnortance and significance of
these sums, but $2.700,000.000 is an important

SENATE

amount of mioney for governients to raise
froni the Canadian people in one year. This
is over fifty per cent of the national income,
which for the coming fiscal year Ne estimate
will bu about $5,300,000,000.
In this calculation honourable members will
have noted that I do not take into account the
additional moneys which will have to bu tied
up in wheat financing, or the possibility that
our direct war expenditures may exceed the
amount we are now asking from Parliament.
Probably none of us can realize the truc
significance of passing over to governments,
on the average, half of our individual income;
or, to put it another way, devoting half the
labour and productive facilities of the country
to war and other governmental work. When it
is remembered that a large part of our population is now at such a level of living standards
that it eau bear very little of the increased
burdens which Canadians as a whole must bear,
the burden on the remaining part of the
population becones recognized as all the more
staggering. Let each of us in this House ask
himself what would happen to his own standard
of living if he were to pay or lend more than
half his individual income to the State. We
are asking the House for this appropriation
because we recognize the fact that probably
this will be the most critical year in the history
of civilization.
I need not say that to carry ont the war
programme for which we are asking the House

to make provision will tax Canada's productive
capacity to the limit, will uecessitate a continuing and more rapid shift fron peace-time to
war-timie production, and will require for many
of us drastie changes in our mode of living and
habits of life. As the Prime Minister said in
his Sunday night broadcast about two weeks
ago, it will "mean more in the way of united
determination, effort and sacrifice than has ever
before been asked of the Canadian people."
The Minister of Finance placed on Hansard
a breakdown of the estimates for the year
1941-42, by departments and services, except
for the Departments of Defence, National
War Services, Agriculture, and Munitions and
Supply, in whicb cases the Ministers presented
the breakdowns for their respective departments.
I have here, under War Appropriation, the
estimates of the Minister of Finance for
194142, by departments and services. As it
is a lengthy statement, I do not suppose I
shall be asked to read it. but in that respect
I am at the disposal of the Senate. The
figures will bu placed on Hansard.

The statement I have presented to the
Senate will give a general explanation of our
estimated war expenditures for the coming
fiscal year. The country has assumed a heavy
responsibility, but I think the general feeling
is that in this war we should make an all-out
contribution until the end.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
honotirable gentleman sits down. can he give
the House an indication of the principles
which control the Government's action in
respect of investing Government funds in
That is to say, what
plants in Canada?
moves the Government to do it? When is
the course pursued, and when is another
course pursued-the usual one?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I have
Hon. Mr. Howe's explanation in that respect.
If my right honourable friend will proceed to

M4

SENATE

give us his views on the Bill, I will try to
furnish the answer before he concludes his
rernarks.

uted among private concerns on the basis
of competitive tenders, or by the best system
that can be found.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this is a money Bill, and
out of regard for tradition, rather than for
law, we never assume to amend such a Bill
and rarely, if indeed ever, assume to defeat
it. A discussion, though, of the general
situation-a very extraordinary one-is not
irrelevant at this moment, and undoubtedly
is called for.
The amount presented for
acceptance is not only large, but formidable
to the degree of being startling. Yet from
that feature, however challenging it be, no
worth-while citizen of Canada will shrink.
Whatever the cost, the work must be done,
the suffering must be endured, and the
principles of honesty and decency in life must
be vindicated.
Two billion, three hundred million dollars,
I think, approximates what the Government
asks of the people of Canada for its war purposes this year, apart, of course, from other
governmental requirements. We are told it
is approximately half the income of our
people. We shall be very fortunate if they
are able to sustain the burden of this war
victoriously and retain anything like balf
of the grand total of our national income.
I do not know that I ever witnessed a more
general willingness among the earners of Canada to surrender anything and everything
that would contribute to real war effort than
I have witnessed in this struggle.
I have inquired as to what principles
governed the Administration in determining
when the time had come to make investment
in plants in Canada for purposes of war
production rather than leave such production to
the regular operation of contracts with private
industry. I am told that later I shall get an
outline of the principles. I read what was
said in the other House, and I am not clear
that a repetition of what was said there will
be very useful. It appears to me from the
Minister's statement that this course is taken
when immediate action is so necessary that
the Government cannot wait. I am not
here to say that it is not at times necessary.
There may be extraordinary exigencies. But
I do venture to leave this thought in the
minds of honourable members: it is a very
rare case indeed-I will go further-it is
actually never the case, that operation under
governmental supervision or control, whether
remuneration is by fee or otherwise, will get
as efficient and economical results for the
taxpayer as operation under contracts distribRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me to read this
statement by Hon. Mr. Howe as to the principles on which bo proceeded? After giving
a list of all the companies, bo said:
Let me try to explain it as simply as I can.
We will say we wish to have a manufacturer
build a plant to manufacture shells. There are
two ways in which this can be donc. The manufacturer can create the asset, pay for the plant
and equipment. The machinery at least would
have no post-war value, or very little, because
it is a specialized process requiring specialized
tools. Obviously, under these circumstances the
Government should permit the manufacturer to
depreciate his plant during the war perhaps to
nothing. or perhaps to some definite ' figure.
Provision is made in the revenue Act to cover
cases where the manufacturer has installed the
plant at his own expense; so that there will be
a depreciation cost, which would naturally be
added to the price of the product.
Then we take the alternative case: the
Government pays for the building and for the
machinery. The Government is also the purchaser of the product. In that case there is
no depreciation charge to the Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
That is
good!
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then follows
this discussion:
Mr. MacNicol: Does the Government operate
the plant?
Mr. Howe: No. We own it. In other words,
the private operator cannot charge depreciation
on a plant for which he did not pay. That i
what we call taking the depreciation at the
start. In that case the product is sold to the
Government more cheaply than the situation
would be with a privately-owned plant which
bought and paid for its equipment.
Mr. Black (Cumberland): One hundred per
cent depreciation is charged up to the initial
order? Then the department would be in a
more favourable position with regard to any
future orders.
Mr. Howe: We could say that, but we take
the depreciation 'in any event. We say this
plant is built for our exclusive use, and we
prefer to depreciate it when we build it.
Mr. Black (Cumberland): The Minister is
referring to equipment furnished to a private
industry. That means that the initial order
bears the total depreciation.
Mr. Jackman: Wben do you write off the
capital cost?
Mr. Howe: Assuming we are the buyer of
the product, we write off the capital cost when
we install the machinery. We write it off
against nothing; we simply write it off. We
own the asset; we pay for Lt. We say to the
operator: "You are using our property; therefore you cannot depreciate it."
I will continue the explanation if it interests
my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I read that
statement. Quite clearly the Minister thor-

MARCH 27, 1941
oughily understands the position. It is just as
plain ta him as it is ta me and ta ahl or mast
of us in this Bouse. But he does net say
there what principle is follawed, and the
leader of the House, even if he rends for
another page, will not find any statement that
would be an answer ta my question. The
Minister says what is the resuit of either
course, but does nat say what decides him ta
take one course rather than the atber.
I think it
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
depends upon general principles.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: But I should
hike him ta tell me under what circumstances
he takes one course and under what circumstances he takes the other. He does not tell
us. Be says: "If I take the course of
letting a contract whereby the contracter bas
ta build a plant which later will be cf no
value, then I have ta pay for the goods at
a price covering depreciation; but if I take
the oth.er course, putting up a plant eut of
public rnoneys, there will be ne charge for
depreciation." No, because it is the State's
property; aîl the depreciation is taken at
once. The question is, which is the better
policy. I can scarcely imagine circurnstances
-though I am net saying they do nat exist--where there would have te be Government
However, I would urge the
investment.
Administration ta shun that course ta the
utmast. True, if you let a centract you must
pay mare in the price of the goads, because
aff the profits must corne taxes and depreciatian. But there is stihl an incentive for the
contractar ta keep dawn casts; he would do
so fer the purpose of making money. Under
a system whereby the centractars increase
their earnings in proportion ta the efficiency
with whieh they perform their werk, you wil
get infinitely better management than you
can ever get by this Gavermrnent pracess of
paying fees.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: But is that not
somnewhat tempered by the 75 per cent profit
returned ta the Government?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is true.
You can go tee far in that regard. Do
nat go so far that yau rernove inoentive.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If yeu go
so far that you take away incentive yeu
cut down your own resuits. I tried ta teach
that lesson-not ta teach, for I arn
net a pedagogue-I tried ta irnpress
it. It is in the mind of every business man.
I have been berated ahi aver Canada by
chatterboxes here and there, but if ever
a truth was plain to anybody it is clear that

8

when yeu take away the whole incentive to
enterprise you will flot have any enterprise:
under the laws and free institutions under
which we live you cannot have it. You may
beg for it. You may pray for it. You may
get down on your knees, as the Minister of
Munitions did-so he told the House of
Cornmons--and implore people to make these
things, but you will neyer get your job done.
He tald us hie bad ta abandon the attempt.
You are getting inte pretty much the saine
position when you are putting up Government plants. If you make a contract with
the man who is to produce the gods, and
he has to build a plant, hie must make sornething out of it after providing for ail his
taxes, depreciation and other deductions. Then
hie will have every incentive to do the job
right, and he will sec to it that the buildings
and plant are such that he can use them to
the best possible advantage afterwards. He
will be steering his course from the very
beginning: by perhaps developing some new
line of product, se that when bis war contracts are over hie can use that plant for
this purpose. He will be adjusting ah bhis
operations so that the construction be is
putting money into, mayý even though there
will be some depreciation, be used later ta
advantage. But what is the Government
going to do with its plants when through
witb them? It has paid for them and will own
them. Does anybody in this House expect it
will get anything substantial for them? Nobody
does. You may have saved a littie profit,
but you have lost your capital: yau may bave
saved the pennies, but you have lost the
dollars.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bility.

That is a possi-

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And a very
great possibility. It bas been an actualjty
so often that one would have thougbt the
Government would have learned its lesson.
One can conceive of circumstances wbere it
may be impossible ta get the required amaunt
of private capital under the conditions of
ta-day, especially with the taxation of to-day,
because no persan can honestly go ta another
and ask him ta put up meney, with ail the
risk of loss and with only a srnall chance of
getting off successfully. It is better ta retain
sufficient incentive so that such a venture
will net everywhere be shunned. In saying
that, I arn speaking from the standpoint of the
State; from no othes, standpoint on earth. Any
man in this country ta-day who shudders at the
thought of the loss of haif bis incame, or
far more than lialf, is not fit ta enjoy the
liberty we are enjoying.

MARCH 27, 1941
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: We know it is the
front line.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -would
leave this country a pris'oner, liungxy and fed
through the bars, and they know the infiltration into and disintegration of countries here
would be of a kind whicli cannot be described
as an invasion, and could not be repelled by
rcgiments within our borders. Tliey know
the democracies have to, win in Europe, that
Britain has to win, if this continent is to be
saved. There is not one of them who lias
flot eaid eo. Let us not f all into this easygoing but stupid sin of isolationism. and
isolationist thought.
We are told there ie a long-distance
programme in the Republic to the south of
us, and I think that is what is in the mind
of the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Horsey). 1 arn sorry if 1 was short with
himn. A long-distance programme of defence
by tic peop le of tic United States? Yes,
there is. I suppose the compulsion of circumstance, the urge of natîonhood, compels
it. No one sympathizes more than we do
with their noble President in the great struggle
he and lis Government have had against
unprecedented difficulties, and the tremendous
mouintains democratie statesmen everywhere
have had to scale in order to bring their
people to a realization of tlie truth. They
in the United States have struggled liard,
manfully and successfully. But keep tlie in
mind: Britain lias to win, and they know it.
Do not think that truth lias not been many
times proclaimed, and more forcibly day by
day. I say we are wasting money riglit liere
in Canada on the mytli of isolationism.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: Tliat is not wliat
Great Brîtain says.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGRIEN: Not wliat
Great Britain says? Oh, don't tell me that.
If you deny Great Britain tlie riglit to
criticize, do not stand up here and tell us
she approves. You cannot do so logically.
For twenty-five years you liave denied lier
the right even to suggest our policy. Great
Britain will applaud any step by Canada that
we think is best for us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is not
the real situation. Great Britain will not
say, "We will approve anything you think
je best for you." Canada is doing what Great
Britain thinks je best for lier.
Rigit Hon. Mr. METOHIEN: I arn not
speaking for the Britisli Government. I arn

the British Government is flot encouraging
the diversion of money for a defence to be
maintained on this continent, four thousand
miles away, when it can be used in the actual
theatre of the conflict. Nobod4 r who tells
me she,is inviting such a diversion can be speaking by the book. Britain does flot complain,
and neyer will; she will accept with gratitude
every effort, whatever it may be. I do flot
say our effort is not better than nothing, but
it is wasteful, because it is vastly Iess effective
than it would be if it were djrectcd where
the real crisis is. This lias been clear since
the war began. I know the Government is
now much nearer that view than it was at
first. Then it had. no thought of sending to
the fighting front the number of men who are
there now. We were complacent for months;
we are not half so complacent to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: And not half
so, complacent as Great Britain was herseif.
Right. Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:- Will this ever
be over? Though she wished sie had got
ready sooner, when the war broke out Great
Britain, in proportion to lier population, had
trained fifty times as many men as we, and
liad produced fifty times as manyý implements
and munitions of war.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But not for tlic
war.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, for tliis
war. Should we be safe to-day if sic liad
not? How should we be secure in our bornes
right now but for the battie she put up and
the success she achieved? That nation lias
stood between us and chaos; so we must not
try to .iustify our complacency by pointing
the finger at her. We are flot as self-satisfied
now as we were.
Here is one. resuit of our not apprcciating
what we were really to face. A year and a
hall ago, or nearly that, I begged the Government to turn its attention to planes, and to
put the ablest man in Canada in charge of
production, in somewiat the same relationsliip
to the Government as Sir Josepli Flavelle
occupied in the last war. This was not done.
Now it is claimed we are doing wonders in
plane production. I was surprised to read tlie
other day a statement by Mr. Bell that we
are now producing forty planes a week, and
that proportionately our output is greater
than that of the United States, where tlie
output is one thousand planes a month. It
must have struck honourable members tliat
this statement was most unfair, if not dishonest. We are flot producing any planes.
TPle so-called planes which we produce have
not our own engines; they have flot our own

SENATE

88

propellers; they have flot our own machine
guns; they have flot our own gadgets, nor Our
own wheels, and they lack a dozen things
more. They are littHo more than shelis. These
other things have to corne from Great Britain
or from the United States. So to compare our
forty planes a week with thoir 1,000 complcted planes is not dealing frankly with the
public of this country.
You may ask, "Could we have done bctter?"
Woll, we are a groat manufacturing country.
Our rnanuifacturing facilitios in this war are,
1 should say, five to tcn times as great as
thoy were in the last war. 1 think the late
President of the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association, Mr. Black, says thoy are relatively even larger than those figures. Comnpared to Australia, we are a great manufacturing country. The difficulties of manufacture
there are vast]y more formidable than here.
We have not produced an aeroplane engine.
Nor, so far as I know, have we arranged for
the production of any. Is that the position
No. They already have two

types which are now and have been for months
in production, and a third is on the way, this
heing the latest and best type. They are
away ahoad also in rifles and large ýmachine
guns. Yet, industrially, Australia is flot at al
comparable to, this Dominion of Canada.
The trouble is that we did not address
ourselves early enough to this task, with a
realization of what it meant. And speaking
of the public in general, and of the Government, 1 do not think we have a realization
of it yet. There is one projeet the Government is undertaking now which, with alI
respect I do want to urge, will tend to
dirninish, and not to deepen, public awareness of what this war means. That projeet is
the St. Lawrence canal. I think it was about
a year ago, long before any decision had been
arrived ut, that 1 urged the Government to
defer that projeet until the war would ho
over. But the Prime Minister decided to go
ahead, and in due course, if an agreement is
passed by the American Senate, we shall be
asked to approve immediate construction of
a canal over the wholo range of the St.
Lawrence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course. this
Bill does flot covor that matter.

they were right. When our peuple witness

and wanted it when hoe was Covernor of
New York. If ho can give us unanswerable
reasuns for going abead with it now, nu une
will ho more ready to meet him than I. But
I want this country to see and study the
facts with its uwn oyes, and net mercly to
bo cuddling into the bosom cf the United
States and whispering words of faith and
flattery. We want to know how this canal

MARCH 27, 1941
is going to belp us win this wvar. ls that
information contained in Mr. Roosevelt's
letter? It is flot.
Some engineer-I do flot know who hie issays the canal can be completed in 1945. Are
you serious when you say that this war will
be fought up into 1945 around the shores of
England, of Egypt and of Greece? You canflot say that. Mr. Roosevelt points out that
we need more ships than are now being buiît,
and that shipyards on the St. Lawrence could
be used. WeIl, we and they have any number
of unused locations and sbipyards now. But
work to capacity is certainly not going on at
ail these yards, nor at nearly aIl. Mr. Roosevelt says that ships they are starting to build
now will flot be completed until the canal is
ready, five years hence, or probably six or
seven years hence. And wben can we expect
to get the ships whose construction is not
to begin until after the canal is ready for
use?
As to power, I do flot hear any cry at
present for St. Lawrence power fromn Ontario,
whose needs are undoubtedly ,greater than
those of any other province. Dr. Hogg did
not utter any such cry when hie spoke before
the Empire Club at Toronto. H1e argued that
construction of the St. Lawrence canal was
sound, but hie said, "Tell me whetber you are
going to build it or flot, because, if you are
not, we can get the power elsewhere and we
should like to start making preparations now."
Power can be got, first of ahl, from the diversion of water into the Great Lakes basin.
That is a splendid thing, and is already
arranged for. Next, power will be obtainable
from Chats Falls, whicb will be ready about
1942. The Carillon Falls can be ready not
long after. And what about Beauharnois,
which, bas a million horse-power-yes, and
morc-lying idie? The dam is built there,
and it is only necessary to divert more water
and make added installations. If tbe United
States need additional hydro power in the
meantime, surely it is better for us to ]et
them have some than to begin with them a
joint undertaking which would require the
labour of thousands of men, as well as
hundreds of thousands of tons of material
evcry year, not to mention the labour of
tbousands of other men wbich would be
diverted into the making of macbinery needed
for construction work. Surely it would be
wiser to use wbat we already bave, to make
available so easily existîng sources of power,
sources wbicb will undoubtedly be ample for
years to come, and ccrtainly bcyond the termi
of this war.
Construction of the St. Lawrence canal at
this time would men not only the diversion
of scores of millions of precious dollars, some

89

of wbich we are begging from our people,
*througb war savings stamps, in amounts of
ten cents, twenty-five cents and one dollar;
it would mean aleo the diversion of labour,
which at this hour is even more precious.
The last ounce of our endeavour is needed for
immediate purposes of war. To provide
munitions and military equipment, s0 much
labour is required that one almost stands
agbast at the figures. For this gigantic and
formidable task, wbere is the labour to be
secured in Canada? Yea, or in the United
States? The canal construction would necessitate also the use of aîl manner of other
property. rolling stock and the like, which at
this time can be used much better for otber
purposes.
I sbould have wisbcd that the case presented to Mr. Roosevelt bad been more comnplete than the one reflected in the correspondence. No argument at ail was made there.
If that correspondence is a verbal photograph of wbat took place, the Government of
Canada is sadly amiss. I do not think the
whole picture is revealed in these letters.
Something more, surely, took place.
I plead witb the Government to bold. its
hand even yet. The starting of the St.
Lawrence prajeet at this time will have
the worst imaginable effect upon public
The United
opinion in both countries.
States is seething with strikes to-day. Wbat
will the situiatlion bc. over there when the
demand for labour becomes much heavier
than it now is? On this side of the border,
too, the labour problem will became increasingly serious. The situation as it existe
at this moment is one xliich demands statesmanlike attention of the first order.
Along these lines I speak strongly, because
I feel strongly. And I think I have a right
to feel strongly. I know that in thiis country there is a general disposition to say,
"Well. if Mr. Roosevelt wants it, let us do
it." The United States is undoubtedly doing
a lot. and Mr. Roosevelt is deserving of
bigh tribute. I bave been as generous as
anyone in this Huse in paying tribute to
him. But I still say hae should give us
reasons wby the canal should, be proceeded
with at this time. If bie gives us convxncing reasons, then of course we shaîl want
to meet bis wisbes. But so far hie bas not
donc so, or even begun to do so. AlI the
facts and figures should be down on the
record before we are asked to commit ourserves to a project such as this.
I place this matter before the Administration witb ail earnestness. So long as sane
policies are pursued we shaîl be able to, get
taxes paid and to raise auir boans, but wby

My right honeurabie friend

would net be absolutely required for the

perbaps in the province of Quebec, I have

My riglit honourable friend is aware that

At

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand

the contribution te Quebec, some $50,000,O00.

MAIRCH 27, 1941

There may be objections to the sebeme under
present conditions. Even in time of peace
obj ections were urged by the State of New
York and other sections of the Union. We
shall have to discuss this matter in due
time, when we shall have occasion to examine
it from ail angles. 1 arn not ready at this
juncture to discuss the point of our being
ioaded with a large expenditure. According
to my right honourab]e friend, the proposed
work would extend over three, four or five
years; so our expenditure each year would
not represent an unduly large amount. But
be that as it may, this is a matter which may
or may not corne before Parliament during
the present session. Therefore we may as well
address ourselves to the expenditures facing us
just now, the expenditures already made, and
the resuits we have obtained, and see whether
we are providing sufficient for the sebemes
of to-morrow, the ycar 1941-42.
My right honourable friend bas said that
the real measure of a country's contribution
to war effort is not the expenditure of money;
it is what the money produces. Well, if the
country were listening to my riglit honourable friend this afternoon it would feel that
hie bas not altered his position to any extent,
aithougli the situation bas developed formidably during the last months. H1e speaks in
so depressing a tone of the resuits produced
by moncy voted during tbe years 1939-40
and 1940-41 tiiet our people would really
believe we bave been simply marking tirne.
Now, there are two things I want to point
out to my rigbt lionourable friend, and lie
knows tliern as welI as I do. We were marking tinie before Dunkirk. We were marking
time because the industrialists of Great
Britain were not dîsposed to allow plants to
be set up in Canada that would be their
rivals in time of peace.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What did
they have to do with them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is a question
of delay. We were begging tliem for hlueprints, for help to build war equipment
that tbey wanted, but tbey were reluctant
to, send us the blue-prints. Tbey were living
in a false paradise: they felt that, being in
possession of the Maginot Line, Great Britain
and France would lie engaged in a defensive
war lasting for some years, and there was
no burry to establish in Canada plants witb
which they would bave to compete after the
war was over. My riglit bonourable friend
bas seen that described in a very interesting
article wvhicb appeared in "Fortune."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot
accept that. Will tbe Minister do this? 1 do
flot know why lie sliould not if wbat lie says
;3 correct. Will bie bring down to tbis Huse

a statement indicating what blue-prints were
refused, by whom, and for how long, and to
what extent the British Government was in
any way in complicity with sucl refusai?
We have a right to this information after
the stateinent the Minister bas made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say this:
the British Government wa.s flot in sympathy
with the British industrialists who wanted to
retain that immense business for themselves.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good.
Then ail our Government had to do was to
cali on the British Governiment to compel
production of those blue-prints.
The British
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Governmcnt had to do so aiter Dunkirk. It
did so when it saw what it was up agai.nst,
and it forced those industrialists to send their
blue-prints to us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Did you s.sk
the British Government before that time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I believe we did
ail we could to gct that information.
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I sbould like
aLreturn brought down giving the history of
those efforts. It would be very illuminating,
and 1 think the country is entitled to it.
There is no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
doubt that after the fali of Norway and
Demnark and the withdrawal fruii Dunkirk
there was a willingness to provide our industrialists with the blue-prints for whicli tbey
were asking. When they did corne, in order
that -they miglit be brought to a stage where
they could be utilized, the Government had
to wait weeks and weeks because of changes
that were constantly appearing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may lie.
If what the Minister says is ri.glt, eitber the
British or the Canadian Government was to
blamne. You can neyer blame individuals.
Governments are responsible, and the 'British
Government was in a position to enforce
action. 1 want the Minister now to agree
to bring down a return showing what representations were made by this Government to the
British Government, and #b~at was the answer
to those representations.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 arn speaking
for myseif. I do not know to what exitent
any correspondence so exchan.ged. could be
produced to-day. But I know thisRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIG'HEN: Unless it can
be produced. 1 think the Minister bas no
night to say wbat hie has said.

very cool atmosphere in Great Britain when
they were asking for orders for war supplies
in regard to which tbey would be competing
with British industry.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I spoke with
a member of that delegation, an industrialist
from Quebec-I cannot recall his name at the
moment--on his return to Canada. He gave
me preeisely the opposite report-that their
reception in Great Britain was satisfactory in
every way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will ask Hon.
Mr. Howe to make a statement in that respect.
He bas had most to do with superintending
those contracts and getting blue-prints.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net
want a statement from Mr. Howe; I want a
return of correspondence. Surely the Government will net say that in a matter in which
it believed the British Government was delaying those blue-prints, it failed to put its
representations in writing for its own justification in future days. The Government must
have done se. If it did net, it was seriousiy
at fault. I ask for a return of that correspondence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
at that moment the two Governments had
net come together to build up plants and
create industries to produce certain results,
except as to the Commonwealth Air Training
Plan.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable leader says the British Government was
delaying. I want to know what representatiens were made te it by this Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not say
the British Government was delaying. I say
that British private industry was quite reluctant to give its plans and secrets and modus
operandi to our manufacturers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is net
good enough. The British Government was
responsible for it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The British
Government started at a certain time-I
think, after Dunkirk-to make its industrialists provide proper blue-prints.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shall be
very glad if the Minister can produce any
evidence of the Canadian Government urging
the British Government to take that action
sooner.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot say
exactly what took place between the two
Governments, but I can say it is of common
repute and is now generally admitted that
H[on. Mr. DANDURAND.

industry in Great Britain was quite reluctant
to furnish material upon which our manufacturers could work.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That does not
meet the case at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Let me tell my
right honourable friend that when I met the
late Mr. Rogers on his return from Europe
last May-that was before Dunkirk-he said
to me, "My dear senator, the unpreparedness
of Great Britain is appalling." Those words
have stuck in my memory. I must take off
my bat to those people who, after Dunkirk,
decided that they would make up for their
long delays in starting to prepare for defence.
I have the greatest admiration for the heroic
effort' made by the British people in organizing their defences after having remained
quiet for twenty years and lagged bebind, in the
belief that they would escape another war.
My right honourable friend would give this
country the impression that our Government
bas spent a lot of money, but lias done
nothing to raise the men necessary for the
purpose of helping Great Britain to defend
herself.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
mainly of machines.

I

spoke

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
After reading
the statements made by the various war
Ministers on the other side to explain their
difficulties and show how they had succeeded
in extending the work of our various industries and in bringing them up to a certain
point of efficiency at this date, I am surprised that my right honourable friend does
net express his commendation of the effort.
The right honourable gentleman refers to aircraft, and says we have done nothing in that
respect. There is a quite simple explanation,
and it is this. Great Britain, which was to
furnish just the things my right honourable
friend says we have not provided for, failed to
do se, and after Dunkirk she admitted her
failure. We then tirned to the United States
to get what Great Britain was to have given
us. Yet my right honourable friend says,
"You have been losing time in net doing
this or that," while we were putting forth
a mighty effort for the defence of the
Commonwealth.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable member permit me?
When
Australia depended on herself for aeroplane
engines and parts, why did Canada have
to depend on others?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am not in
a position to compare the effort of Canada
with that of Australia.
However, without

93

MARCH 27, 1941
commenting on the efforts made by other
parts of the Commonwealth, I believe that
Canada bas made a worthy effort and can
hold its head high. It bas given ail it could,
to the point of spending more of the national
wealth, per capita, than Great Britain was
furnishing. A littie country like Canada, a
peace-time country, far removed from the
turmoils of Europe, has succeeded to a coinI should not like the
mendable degree.
country to romain under the impression that
Canada bas not done the riglit thing. This
country bas put forth a formidable effort,
a noble effort, and one quite different from
what one would gather from the remarks of
my right honourable friend. What I have
to, criticize my right honourable friend for
in that lie seizes upon some weak points, and
omits the other side of the picture.

and Liberal newspapers alike. It was made
at the close of the debate on tbis matter on the
25th of Marcb.
We are enacting a measure which pledges
Canada to the mont stupendous effort in our
national hi-story. 1 feol we should, not allow
the Bill to receive its third reading in this

possible credit to those who have made the
measure possible, and who are bearing the
burden of the tremendous task which it imposes,
namely, the people of Canada.
There has been far too great a tondency.
hoth in the House and in the Press, to speak
of what we are doing as the Government's war
effort. We ail know it is something f ar greater
than that; it is Canada~s war effort. What is
more, it is an effort which is wholly worthy
of Canada, and of which every Canadian in
entitled to be justly proud.
As a tribute to the people, whom al] of us
in this Chamber represent, I am going to try
this afternoon to put that effort in its true
perspective; to give a broad picture of what
Canada is already doing, and what we have
undertaken to do in the coming year.
It is only eighteen montbs eince we entered
the war. Yet. in that vear and a half; our
armfed forces have gro-wn to the point where
to-da, in the three services, there are a quarter
of a m;illion mon on active service. 1 might
add that this figure does flot inelude over
175,000 additional men, enrolled in the reserve
army, who are subjeet to eall for the' defence
of Canada.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
that I have to apologize for anything.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
A Canadian Army Corps, Canadian destroyers,
and Canadian air squadrons are sharing in
the defence of Britain. 'Our Navy and our
Air Force are doing their part to keep open
the vital sea lanes of the north Atlantic.
Canadian garrison . in Iceland, Newfoundland
and the W est Indies are Con guard in the
outposts of this continent. Canadian enginoors
are strengthening the defences of Gibraltar. In
recont months we have also sent overseae
hundreds of radio mechanies for vital defence
duties with the Royal Air Force.
From the Atlantic to the Pacifie, Canada
to-day is throbbing with military activity.
Soldiers, sailors and airmen are co-operating in
the defence of our prts, our coasts and our
coastal waters. The C anadian Navy, which had
only fifteen ships when war broke out, now
lias over 180.
Wby does my bonourable friend from
Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon) not applaud
these statements?
Nearly sixty rnilitary training camps are
distributed across the country. In these camps,
the soldiers in our active arnly, and the young
men calle(l up under the National Resources
Mobilization Act to prepare them for the defence
of Canada, are now training side by aide.
Soine niinety establishments of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan are adready in
operation. In addition, facilities are being provided for training schools of the Royal Air
Force under the jurisdiction of Canada's Air
Ministry.
It is for the maintenance and expansion of
this inilitary programme tlhat the present
appropriation is being voted. The Ministor of
Finance has already told the flouse that lie
expects the appropriation to be exceeded, and
that his bort estiniate at present is that, in
the next fiscal year, Canada's direct war effort
will cost the Canadian people $1,450,000,000.
But Canada lias a twofold task in this war.
Not only 'are we sharing as a full partner in
the struggle; flot only are we, with but one
important exception,- ourselves bearing the whole
cost of equipping, supplying and maintaining our
military, naval anci air forces at home and overseas, giving of life as well as of treasure, but
ive are also helping to supply to Britain equipment, munitions an(l the other essentials of war.
The exception 1 have referred to is this: Canada
in paying the entire cost of three air squadrons
already in Britain. But as Canada is bearing
the major portion of the cost of the British
Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the United
Kingdom, on its part, will maintain in the field
Caliadian pilots and airmen graduated f rom the
plan.
What 1 have said up to the present relates
to Canada's outright national contribution as
a belligerent. It is being paid for in full by

MARCH 27, 1941
purchases in Canada, and our own expanded
war programme, the estima.te of Canada's gross
national income in the new fiscal year has
been raised to $5,950,000,000.
For the benefit of those, either in this or in
other countries, who have nrt a due appreciation
of the magnitude of Canada's war effort, or
who may have been misled by comparisons
between our war effort and what bas been said
concerning the lease-lend programme of the
United States, I am going to translate a few
of these figures into comparable American terms.
I understand the national income of the United
States this year is expected to exceed 80 billion
On that basis the estimated war
dollars.
expenditure, direct and indirect, of Canada, in
1941-42, would be equivalent to an expenditure
by the United States, in a single year, of
almost 35 billion dollars. lu providing the
Canadian dollars necessary to meet the deficit
in Britain's balance of payments with Canada
iext year, the Canadian people will be rendering financial assistance to Britain which would
lie equivalent, in comparable American terms,
to something over 15 billion dollars a year.
These figures may help members of Parliament
and the people of our country to appreciate
wliat Canada is committed to, and what is
meant by the statement that, in our opinion,
Canada is making the maximum effort of whici
this country is capable.
But this is merely tbe financial side. Let me
also make the comparison in tercms of human
lives. Apart fron Canada's material contribution, Canada's men are participating in this
war. The quarter of a million Canadians on
active service would, in terns of the population
of the United States, be equivalent to an armed
strength in the forces of the United States of
over two and thiree-quarter million men, and
this witout taki.ng account of a reserve army
for home defence.
For the great contribution whicl the United
States is making; for the still greater contribution whieh it will make, the Goveriment and
people of Canada have nothing but admiration
and gratitude. Since the United States has
pledged its strengtli to a victorious issue we
know that the struggle, though hard, will be
shorter. But iu the enthusiasn of our satisfaction tiat the United States has resolved to
throw the decisive weight of its material aid
into the struggle, ve as Canadians have no
reason to discount the magnitude of the material
contribution whiclithe people of this Dominion
are making. Nor should it ever lie forgotten
that Canada is spending, not only ber treasure,
but ber blood. Never in the history of var
bave eleven million people given so 'freely and
pledged so fully their treasure, their resources
and their manhood. I venture to say also that
Canadians lave reason to be proud of the part
whici Canada has had in the reconciliation of
the English-speaking peoples. the healing of
ancient wounds. and the closing of the great
sclism of the Anglo-Saxon race.
Surely in the light of such a war record,
w-ithout boasting and without vainglory, we mav
adl take pride in the vision; flie unity, the
resolution and the achievement of flic Canadian

0F

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I should like to draw attention to, a
manifest error in the report of a remark of
mine appaaring at page 100 of Senate Hansard
(Unrevised Edition). Speaking of the astimated expenditure on the St. Lawrence Waterway, I said, "I îînderstand our share wiIl be
840,000),000 odd"; and I arn reported as
adding: "and Ontario's $50,000,000. Canada's
expenditura would flot total $150,000,000."1
There ivas an interruption, which may
justify the reporter's failure to catch my
words, the meaning of which is obvious.
Instead of saying Ontario's share would be
350,000,000, what I said, or meant to say, was:
I undarstand our share w~ill ba $40,000,000
odd. and, with the coiitribution ta Quabee, sonia

I did flot look at the report of my remarke
before it went to the printer. On the samne
page there are two or thrae small corrections
to be made, but they are not worth mantioning
to-day. For instance, in one place I refarred
to the situation "during the last months,"
but I arn made to say. "during the hast month."
That makes quite a diffarence.
Righlt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 0f course 1
do flot objeet et ahl to the corrections. In fact
1 think 1 recail that the honourable leader
of the Ilouse referred to the contribution to
Qtiebuc; so I have no doubt hie said just
what lie now~ states. But whihe lie is correcting lie miglit make a job of it and change the
figures right thirotigbi. This statement I wouhd
'sif it were within the rides of the Houseis a deception of the people. The figures the
honourable member had in bis mind rafer
on!y to the international section. Canada's
obligations in respect of the Canadian section
are aIl bier own, and these figures are mare
trifles comparcd to the oblig-ations we are to
incur.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose what
my right honourabla friend means is that the
amount Canada will have to pay is very con,,iderablc, because Ontario's share is inchuded.
Tbat I rocogýnize. I confess I do flot remamber
having said that Canada's expanditure wouhd
not total 3150,000.000. I do not know to what
thiat fi-ture refers.
ligbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The $150,000,000 would be just the beginning. So, to
correct it, one needs to go a littla further than

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Bonourable members, bofore the Orders of the Day are called,
I want to refer to my inquiry which the
leader of the House answered a few minutes
ago, and in which, it will be obseýrved, I
stated 1 should cali the attention of the
Government to the matter inquired into. Il
I amn in order, I intend to deal with the
subject-matter of my inquiry, not in any
critical spirit, but entirely with. a view to
adding information that may be of benefit
to the Department of Transport. If I am
not ini order, I. would give notice that I
shahl caîl attention to this proposed installation. I shouhd- like a ruling by the Chair.

not appear on the Orde-r Paper,' but I have
no objection to bis proceeding.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

aEVIBED
EIiITION

As a matter of fact,
notice of inquiry that
on the Order Paper
I heard last January

98

SENATE

among railway men in regard to the proposed
installation of a centralized traffic control
system on the Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would the honourable
gentleman explain what that is?
Hon. Mr. BLACI{: I will give the explanation as I have it from those who know much
more about the subject than I do. The
purpose of the installation is said to be to
avoid detention and to speed up traffic. In
other words, this system of centralized traffic
control is intended to facilitate the loading
and unloading of trains and the clearing of
traffic where there is congestion.
There is no doubt that in the Maritime
Provinces, both on the Canadian National
Railways and on the Canadian Pacific Railway,
there is much congestion of traffic during the
winter season, especially under war conditions.
In peace-time, for a number of years preceding the war, there had beeq no traffic congestion. At the present time there is great
congestion, particularly from Moncton to
Halifax, and to a lesser extent from Moncton
to Saint John, where the Canadian Pacifie
Railway takes a good deal of the traffic.
I put my inquiry on the Order Paper
because of the discussion to which I have
already referred and because of some questions I asked the railway men who engaged
in that discussion with regard to the advisability of this system. I intend now to give
the honourable leader of the House the
criticisms I then heard, which, I may add,
were not condemnatory.
The railway men who were opposed to
installation of the system said that it had
not been tried out, either in the United
States or Canada, over any considerable
mileage. In answer to the fourth question of
my inquiry I am told the system has been
used in Canada for a distance of from two
to six miles. It is proposed, I am told, to
install the system from Pacifie Junction to
Truro, a distance of about 136 miles. This
is a long distance to be electrically controlled.
in my inquiry I asked:
Has this systen been in use under elimatie
and

snow

conditions similar

to

those which

obtain in the winter season on that portion of
the road where such installation is to be estab-

lished?

I inferred from what the railway men said
that the system had not been tried out under
similar conditions. This winter, from Campbellton to Halifax there were snow blockades
almost every week. It is extremely doubtful
whether a system of this type, operated by
electricity, can be properly worked and maintained during the period of heavy snowfalls,
when it is most needed, and when, if put
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

out of commission, it would be very difficult
to restore to working order within at least
a day. That is the criticism offered by those
who, I assume, know a good deal about
the matter.
A discussion arose as to the two opposite
views.
One person advocated the system,
though lie admitted it had not yet been
tried out under such winter conditions as
exist down there. Three railway men, who
seemed to know what they were talking about,
said that while there had been a large increase
in traffic in the Moncton, Truro, Saint John
and Halifax yards, yet a greater development of railway trackage in those congested
areas would be much more useful than the
installation of this system. They were of
opinion that the yards could be extended out
from Halifax to Bedford and even to Shubenacadie. They suggested that by the doubletracking of the road between Moncton and
Sackville considerable improvement would be
effected; also that the trackage in the Truro
yards might be added to considerably and
the yardage extended from Truro towards
Oxford Junction.
From the discussion I gathered that the
railway men were three to one in favour of
inereased trackage rather than the proposed
installation to take care of traffic congestion
brouglt about by war conditions.
The cost is said to be $1,200,000. This would
have to be considerably increased, because
the equipment having to be purchased in the
United States would have to be paid for in
United States currency.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Is it a block signalling system, or what is it?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: For further information
I must refer the honourable gentleman to the
railway authorities:
The answer to my
inquiry pretty well gives the estimated cost.
I am not sufficiently conversant with railway
management to give any detailed information,
and therefore I shall not attempt to do so. If
the cost is going to b $1,200,000, plus United
States exchange, which is very badly needed in
Canada at this time, that is an important
consideration. Furthermore, it is contended
that increased trackage would meet the situation, because the congestion is only a war-time
condition. I do not believe many of us are
hopeful enough to think that after the war
is over railway traffic will continue to increase.
If we were to lay down a little more trackage
for the duration of the war. we could, when it
was no longer required, take it up and use it
elsewlere. Thus we should avoid an investment of between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000, to
be charged against the capital account of the
railway. The cost of laying down the addi-

APRIL 1, 1941
tional track would be only a slight proportion
of that amount, and the difference saved could
be apýpiied to war purposes.
What 1 have given you, honourable senators,
is not my own opinion, for 1 have no intimate
knowledge of the subi ect. I ar n ot criticizing
the railway management, beeause I have flot
sufficient know.ledge to do so, but it seorne
to me that the suggestion made ie sound
financially and is a proper one to be placed
before the Minister or the management of the
Canadian National Railways for consideration.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, when I saw this inquiry on the
Order Paper I thought my honourable friend
was referring to the automatie block system
which is in use on hundreds of miles of
Canadian railways to-day; but after hearing
the answer given to-night, that there je only
six miles of thîs centralized traffic control
s3Jstem in Canada, 1 muet confess that I do
not know anything about it and that it cannot
be at ail what I thought it was. We have the
automatic block system on hundreds of miles
of our railways. Many of you, in riding on a
train, have seen the signal raised behind you
as you went paet, and it dropped when you got
out of the block. I know that systern works
quite satisfactorily on hundrede of miles in
both Eastern and Western Canada. But what
the honourable gentleman refers to muet be
something entirely different.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was trying to understand
what it was, but I could not find out.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
Ipresume we are speaking to a motion of
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Black)
that he will caîl attention to certain matters.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Not necessarily

a motion.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: My difficulty is that
1 do not understand the situation at ail. I
do not blame the honourable member from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black), who only
repeats certain conversation he bas heard
and gives other information which bas corne
to him; but I doubt very much whether
there is an honourable member in this House
who understande exactly what this is ail
about.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Heur, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As you cannot compare certain expenditures with expenditures
about which you know nothing, and with
respect to which you are not in a position to
form any judgment, I would suggest that my
honourable friend be given time to consult
those frorn whorn he received hie information
14879--7j

99

and have them explain what the proposed new
system is. When we have the explanation
we shaîl know where we stand.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The purpose I had in
mind bas been achieved. I desired to caîl
the attention of the railway management and
of the Minister to the fact that this new
system had not been tried out in Canada or
in the United States to any great extent, and
that corne railway authorities are not quite
satisfied that it is going to work. I arn not
criticizing; I arn rnerely calling attention.
Hon. Mr. DANDTTRAND:
Honourable
senators, I will inform the departrnent of my
honourable friend's staternent and will draw
attention to it. Surely the Departrnent of
Transport will be able to give me the facts
and an explanation that will satisfy the Senate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
wish the honourable the leader of the House
would tell us what we are talking about.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I tried to get the honourable senator frorn Westmorland to tell me
what it is we are discuesing, and I failed. I
had hoped the leader of the House wouldt
tell me, but I arn stili in the dark. I arn
told that my honourable friend does not need
a candle to light hirn around in Montreal,
and it seerns terrible to think that ho is taking
something to the department withouýt knowing
what it is. If the honourable member from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) cannot tell us,
I think we are lost.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think somethixg should
be done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I can
go to the fountaix of knowledge, the Depnrtment of Transport, and secure information
as to what it ahl means.
Hon. Mr. HAIO: Hear, hear.
WAR APPROPRIATION BILL
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

On the Ordere of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I have been corne forty odd years
in the Sonate, and f or the firet tirne I rise to
a question of privilege. It will be remernbered
that in Auguet last the Montreal Gazette had
a very bitter article againet the Senate's attitude on the TJnemployment Insurance Act.
Lt even went to the length of asking that we
should vote for our own abolition. Considerable discussion took place at the time
over that onslaught on the Sonate by the

SENATE
Montreal Gazette.
My right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) liad to
explain his own situation, and that of others,
with respect to the vote that bad been cast.
For my part, I made light of that assault by
anonymous writers, whose names, had they
been known, would have rather amused the
readers of the Gazette.
The Montreal Gazette junta were deeply
offended at my remarks, and now they are
on the warpath. I take no exception to their
strictures as to my behaviour and ny statements in the Senate, but I desire to answer
in regard to what I feel to be a matter of
interest, not only to me, but to the Senate
itself. The article suggests that because of
my speech delivered on Thursday last my
English-speaking colleagues in the Cabinet
should sec to it that representations are made
and that I am disciplined.
Here is the
indictment:
TIIF DANDURAND ATTACK
Nothing more il-considered or ill-timed bas
conie ont of Ottawa since the commencement
of the war than the extraordinary statement
of the Government Leadr in the SenateSenator Dandurand, a member of the Mackenzie
King Cabinet-a statement whih cannot be

construed as anything but a deliberate and
highly miscliievous attack on British industry
and therefore upon the British Government.
The attitude of British industry in facilitating
or not facilitating production of war inaterials
in Canada must be considered a British Government responsibility. and for this reason, if for

no other, Senator Dandurand's remarks assume

a complexion of the utmost gravity.
The
Covernment leader in the Senate told that body
on Thursday that, prior to the evacuation at
Dunkerque, incustry in Great Britain refused
to facilitate construction of plants in Canada
which miglît enter into competition with British

plants after the war. Prior to Dunkerque; lie
said, the Britisli people were in a fool's paradise
and said there was no hurry. Suggestions that
plants be built in Canada which would compete
with British plants were colîly received by
British industry. British industrialists refused
to provide their plans, secrets, blue-prints, etc.,
that might be used in conpetition with then
after the war. After Dunkerque the attitude

changed entirely-, and Senator Dandurand
eu.logized the splendid way in which British
industry and the British people then rose to
the occasion.
Senator Meighen promptly demanded a return
showing whether the British or the Canadian

Government was blameworthy in not compelling
British industry to co-operate at the time named
by Senator Dandurand. The Government leader
was not prepared to promise this return. It
does not matter whether lie brings it down or
not; the damage tas been donc. Englishspeaking citizens throughout the Dominion cannot but experience a sense of anger over the
conduct of the Minister who, individually and
in common with other members of the Cabinet,
lîad been preaching national unity in this
country, a united front by French-speaking and
English-speakin g Canadians in the prosecution
of the war. Na.tional unity is net being promoted when Senator Dandurand indulges in

It is calculated to do a maximum
of harm now, and the entire Government, on

the principle of collective responsibility, must
accept responsibiity for it. The only way to
avoid thîis is to discipline Senator Dandurand,
and to do it publicly.

Mr. John Bassett waxes indignant. The
crime of lese-mîajesty lias been commnitted.
It would look as thougli there had been an
act of treason against the Crown. Just think
of it! I have dared to talk of British industry
being for a certain length of time reluctant

to help our Canadian manufacturers to make
munitions and implements of war. I knew
tlîat this matter had been discussed

on all

sides. I had heard repcated complaints ail
around me, in Ottawa and in Montreal.
I have

not hîad

time to

review the

pro-

longed discussion in the other House, but J
can point to a statement of the Honourable

Mr. Howe to the effect that in the first period
of the war the United Kingdom apparently
believed she would be in a position to depend
largely on her own munitions industry. This
is in fact what I stated, and this explains

why very few orders were coming to our Canadian manifacturers during that time. Here
is Mr. Howe's statement:
In the last statement which I made in this
louse

toward the close of the last session, I explained
that the nature of our problems was changing.

I pointed out that in the first period of the war

the United Kingdon appeared to believe that
she would te in a position largely to depend
on lier own munitions industry. The successive
overrunning of Denmark, Norway, Holland, and
Belgium, and the collapse of France changed

I knew also that Fortune, an important
American review,. had laid stress on the relations of British and Canadian industries in its
issue of November, 1940, but I had not that
review at hand; 1 have since recalled that it
was the Montreal Gazette which drew the
attention of the public to this study of Canada
at war, by Fortune, and which prompted me to
read it. The commendation by the editpr of
the Gazette was complete and without any
reserve whatsoever. It appeared in the editorial columns of that paper on October 31, 1940,
under the heading, "An Industrial Miracle."
Here is the editorial:
AN "INDUSTRIAL MIRACLE"

Canada is again the subject of a leadine
article in Fortune, a "magazine of management'
published in New York. In its current number
a great tribute is paid to Canada's leading
industrialists--to their initiative and enterprise
in bringing Canada's industries into active
co-operation with the national war effort, and
to the resolution manifest in every branch of
our industry to "prop up the Empire" and help
wie the war. What the writer of the article
foresees as an ultimate result is "an industrial
machine" capable of giving the Dominion an
industrial independence alike of Great Britain
and the United States. During the first nine
months of war Canadian industrialists were
f avoured with only small orders for war
meterials. Then came the f ail of France and
within the ensuing four months Canadian
industry had received firm orders totalIing
$275,000,00. The despateli with which these
orders were executed, or are being executed,
and the efficiency of the output has won
admiration on aIl han(ls. Says Fortune in its
November number: "When you consider that
Canadian industry had neyer made a tank, a
combat airplane or a modern high-calibre
rapid-fire gun, the speed witli which îndustry
was organized and actual production started
coming off the Iines ranks as an industrial
miracle."
No more convincing evidence could bie gîven
of Canada's ability to stand on her own feet in
helping Great Britain. As Canada's industrial
machine expands, the Dominion, Fortune is
confident, will, in virtue of hier acquired
economie strength, become more and more
independent of the United Kingdom economieally.
But wilI she tend to become more
dependent on the United States? Since the
beginning of the current year imports from the
United States have increased by 55 per cent,
as compared witli an increase during the samne
period of only 37 per cent in our exports to
that country. Due to the fact that the war has
closed to Canada quite a number of markets
abroad it would seem almost inevitable that
economically we shahl be brouglit more and
more at the mercy of our neighbour. The
situation in this respect is bound to become
accentuated if the war is prolonged. That will
increase Canada's difficulties iii finding the
Unîtcdl States dollars needed to pay for ierw

purchases of basic materials. Fortune admits
that if the tourist business and gold production
f ail to make ends meet, Canada might be
forced to place quota restrictions on United
States goods of non-essential character; might
lie forced to liquidate the balance of Canadianheld United States securities; or, as a last
resort, might bie forced to discontinue or put
on quota the payment of interest and dividends
to United States holders of the $4,000,000,000
worth of Canadian securities.
But surely these are remote contingencies,
and there is encouragement in Fortune's affirmation that, in any event, "long before the last
point lias been reacbed it is likely that the
United States will have found some wey, perhaps under the common defence pact, to lend
Canada United States dollars." This would
to an appreciable extent relieve the situationand in the very f act bring the two countries
into dloser eeonomic union. From that point
iA would bie easy to argue that, ont of dloser
economic bonds, political bonds miglit evolve
and eventually bring about political union.
Fortune, however, decries this idea and in the
liglit of the realities as we know them, this
United States magazine reasons quite soundly
ie pointing ont that no matter how mucli money
the United States miay lend Canada, or liow
fer the United States will go in deciding that
the Ottawa-Washington defence pact for defence
is also a pact for offence, or how close economically the two countries become in the future,
Canada will not come any dloser to political
union.
Canada lias lier own problems-notably those
of wheat and the raîlways-and no matter what
difficulties they and the added problcm of
adjusting our relatively tremendous industrial
machine to the weys of peace may present,
Canadians will want to solve them for themselves. As an offset-if the bright picture
which Fortune's article draws lias the true
perspective-Canada will bave the advantage
of being able to compete in the markets of a
war-free world on a better basis than ever
before, and so may find herself the principal
foreign trade arm of North American industry.
Canada certainly will appreciate
and lie
cheered by this article, and whatever may lie
its other merits, the writer can lie assured of
this: Hie is everlastingly riglit in bis conclusion
tliat come wbat may, we wiIl remain Canadiens.
From the Fortune article, so highly praised
by the Gazette, I will now read excerpts
that cover all the statements I made, statements which, thougli in far more moderate
terms. have so scandalized the Montreal
Gazette. Fortune speaks of our declaration
of war, and of "a set of laws which were
passed to control a war economy," adding, "but
there was little war economy to control." It
goes on to say:
Canada, eager to lielp, was told to wait. At
hast. when war broke against the eliffs of
Dover, Canada suddenly started into amazing
action. The Government went aIl-ont on
budget that made the war economy e faet
rather tîjan a blue-print; it speeded up a huire
training programme for air pilots, and miracalously turned its infant industry into roaring
arsenais. The story of these hesitations andI
the rapid steps that suereeded them is tbe story
of Canadda's first yea.r ot war.

SENATE

The article then refers to our financial
measures, the Budget, a tax on excess profits,
foreign exchange control, and so on, and it
continues:
But the Government, ail dressed up in these
exchange controls, and in the price controls and
tax measures previously mentioned, and with a
nice, round 100-million-dollar appropriation for
the prosecution of the war, soon found that
it had no place to go. For six months Canada
marked time. The simple fact is that Canada
didn't have a war economy because it didn't
have a war. Its ally would not let it have one.

could not be bought, their war became a war
at the cheapest price, and they fought it
believing that Gernany could be worn down
via the British Navy and the Maginot Linein other words, through economic attrition.
So England had no intention of permitting
Canada to build an industrial machine for the
war effort, because that machine would be a
threat to its industry when peace came.
The United Kingdom's narkets bad already

enough so that England's tight little industrial
autocracy in war-time preferred to buy, and
did buy, in the U.S. rather than have Canadian
plants expanded.

Toronto industrialists

went

to London, but got only a few educational orders
for sbells, military clothing, and powder. They
were pointedly told that the production of
planes. tanks, and guns was "well provided for
in Englaind." Canada's part in the war, they

said, was to train airmen, a long-term programme that in a number of years would supply
the Empire with tens of thousands of pilots a
year-and England would make the planes and
supply the engines.
Sensing that they were in a backwater in a
var of stagnation, the Ontario industrialists in
December began shooting at Mr. King's Govern-

a great clamour for Mr. King's head, long

King, kmnsowing

that the fault lay not in Ottawa but in London,
again showed bis conmmand of parliamentary
strategy. Jn one of the most surprising political
noves Canauda has ever secn. he cauglt bis

H1on. Mr. DANDURAND.

The inconsistency of the Montreal Gazette
is made quite apparent when one places side
by side its attack upon me and its eulogy of
Fortune's article. I am not surprised at this
inconsistency, nor at the malice which the
paper displays. It tries to make a mountain
out of a molehill. And it appeals to my
English-speaking colleagues to express their
disapproval. Why that appeal to my Englishspeaking colleagues, when, according to the
Gazette, the principle of collective responsibility is involved?
If the high priests of jingoism in this country showed to the men charged with the
heavy responsibility of steering the ship
of State during these troublous times half
the sympathy and commendation they bestow
upon the men at the helm in Great Britain,
they would help to create an atmosplhere of
amity and goodwill among Canadians which
would redound to their credit and be most
helpful in the prosecution of the war. But
then the President of the Montreal Gazette
would no longer be a jingo. This would
indeed be a miracle.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the leader of the House
has, as he knows and as everyone knows,
gone away beyond his right in respect of a
question of privilege. He knows the limits
within which one is bound to keep when one
asserts that right. I am net going to review
this subject-the time for doing so will come
-but I do say this: the leader of the House

Riglît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly;
but that is not the point in issue. What
Fortune said of Gieat Britain was not
referred to in the Gazette at all, nor was it

supported by one titile of evidence, and I an

could quote such articles by the score-in
justification of his reflection on the British
people and the British Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would only
say that I read Fortune at the behest of the
Gazette, which eulogized the article from
A to ZRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It did flot.
Hon. Mr. DANDUJ'RAND: -and declared
it was an admirable thing. I think I have a
right to say that the article in Fortune,
eulogized by the Gazette without any reservation whatever, went far beyond what I did
say, yet as a matter of fact remained in the
realm of truth in stating that the industrialists of Great Britain, up to the time of the
Dunkirk withdrawal, did not desire to have
Canadian industries built up while they thernselves could furnish materials of war. But I
will say more.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If you do, I
will too.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will say more.
The policy of the Government of Great
Britain at the time was exactly that followcd
by its industrialists, for the simple reason
that Great Britain wanted goods for export
te Canada to offset its purchases here and
to build up credits in Canadian funds. This
policy was clearly indicated when we set up
the Commonwealth organization.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is this a
question of privilege, or is it another debate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No; but I
allowed my right honourable friend to speak.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was good

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There can be
no discussion on a question of privilege.

THE LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION 0F TE
SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is
another matter I want to raise on the Orders
of the Day. It is to caîl attention to the
treatment of Parliament, and especially the
treatinent of this Hue, at the present time.
Outside of three or four small private bills,
with the disposition of whi*ch the Government

103

bas no power as between the Houses, we
have before us now three measures: the usual
one that cornes every year to renew the grant
to the cîty of Ottawa; the usual one that
cornes every year to reappoint the auditors of
the National Railways; and another Bill to
amend the Meat and Canned Foods Act.
We are now in the, third or fourth month ci
this session. AIl we have ever had before us
yet is a money Bill, and as to that money
Bill we have no right to amend it, and,
traditionally at least, no right to defeat it.
What are we? Do honourable members feel
this is all that is being done legislatively in
the Dominion? I doubt whether there ever
was a time in our history when more legislative
problems were being deait with than now.
Necessarily there must be legislative questions
of the most intricate, far-reaching and momentous kind. We read of them in the Press,
aven while Parliament sits-questions affecting
vast sums of money, vast rights of property,
rights and liberties of the subi ect; questions
touching everything that is sacred and important in our national life. But this is what is
brought to us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Gommons can send us.

It is aIl that the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.
The rest is dealt by Order in Council of this
Covernment while we solemnly meet and* go
through tis farce. It is dýone every day.
Are we, for example, to have for review the
legislation which affects the exemption rights
of our citizens? It neyer cornes near us, yet
it changes their whole basis. Are we to have
before us the legisiation. we read so much of,
under which a new turn is to be given to
agriculture over 'haif of this great country and
vast surns from the Dominion treasury are
to ha appropriatad for the purposa of diverting the anergies of agriculture from one field
into anothar? That lagisiation, I understand,
will ba marely included ini the Estimates and
otharwise dealt with by Ordar in Council.
Tremendous things are dona behind the closed
doors of Government whila Parliament is
sitting, and there is submitted to us the
mornentous question of daciding whather wa
ought to change the definition of canned
lobster meat! We sit here with our faces
set as though wa were real legislators. This
is surely of asmuch importance to every
other member of this House as to me. It is
particularly important to honourabla membars
opposite. What thay say to the Govarnment
and what pressure they bring to bear on it
will have some effect. Nothing we can do
can have any effeet on the position. If this
continues what is to become of Parliamant,
or of this branch of Parliament? I have a

they do, and we accept payrnent, we are flot
the rnen we ought to be. There is nothing
but cynical disdain for the rights of the
nation's representatives in both flouses, but
especially in this House, for we cannot amend
a rnoney Bill. The door is shut on us and we
are told we have nothing to do with tbings
of such consequence-consequence,

is just a quiet, cynical disdain and conternpt
of Parliarnent and particularly of this flouse.
Everyonc 1 arn facing knows it is. It is, on
the part of the Government, just a thuînbing
of the nose at Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend was flot here the other day
when I brought down figures regarding the
2,600 Orders in Council which he had stated
had been passed during the session of Parliament and concerned matters that should have
been brought before Parliament. I thinkRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Excuse me.
I did not say they ai should have been
brought before Parliarnent. A lot of thern
are rnerely administrative. I arn complaining
of things that are fundarnentally legisiative,
that undoubtedly should corne before Parliament when Parliament is sitting.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend bas referred to agriculture and
to the difficulties wve are encountering in the
West over the wvheat question. and he says,
"Is it not a rnatter that should interest the
Senate?" Undoubtedly it is, and it will corne
before us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

How?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My righit honourable friend says, "But there is a Supply
Bill for $35,000,000, and we have nothing to
do but nccept the figure or reject it." I want
to tell biîn this. There are considerable difficulties in drafting legislation to fit provisionally the present situation in the West.
Regulations will be subrnitted to the flouse

by Order in Council the Governent wvill
proceed through the Departrnent of Agriculture. I think that when my riglit honourable
friend secs those regulations he wilI understand there is a situation that rnust he faced,
and when he hears the reason why they cannot
be incorporated in legisiation he will ponder
over it and agree there is wisdorn in the
conclusion. But we are discussing in advance
a rneasure that is to corne here.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJGHEN:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course rny
right honourable friend bas been in power and
bas seen to the adrninistration of such rnatters
as the wheat question and agriculture, but he
has not yet confronted a situation sirnilar to
the present one. From 1914 to 1917, when he
was in power, wheat was selling et frorn $2 to
$3 a bushel. There was Do question then of
facing a situation such as we have to-day. Lt
is so complex that therc are very good reasons
why the Governent should proceed in one
way and not the other.
My right honourable friend bas no rigbt to
say this flouse is valueless because nothing is
coming to us. HIe knows very well that this
is a war session and practically ail the legisiation relates to the war. Tbere is flot a
financial question without sucb a bearing;
not even the question of agriculture.
The
rnen at the helm of wbat are called the war
departrnents are in the other flouse. It is for
tbemn to answer questions, and the Lord knoxvs
tbey are plied daily witb questions to the
point of being unable to adrninister their
departrnents as tbey sbould; but they rnust
answer the caîl of Parliarnent.
My right
honourable friend knows very well that the
work cannot be stopped. The Minîsters do
their utrnost by working frorn fifteen to
eighteen hours a day. Sornetirnes at midnigbt
I can sec the ligbts in their offices, wbere
they are still working because tbey have to
rnake up for the tirne given to the flouse of
Commons. My righit bonourable friend cannot expect us to duplicate that work here,
and he does not ask it either.
Now, lie speaks of agriculture. Well, agriculture is fundarnentally a question of finance,
because we are facing an expenditure of
$35,000,000, based on a certain solution proposed by the Governrnent. My right bonourable friend rnay say there is a better solution,
but the West is represented in the other
flouse, and their rnernbers can state what are
the desires of the three Western Provinces.
Undoubtedly they are attending to the
interests of their constituents. We have no
constituents to defend, except on general
principles. But I arn quite sure rny right

APRIL 1, 1941
honourable friend is in error when he states
that we might as well adjourn and go home
because we are flot given important legisiation. It, should be borne in mind that this is
a war session. As I said some time ago, when
we are reproached with flot being very active
we should remember that silence on our part
represents wisdomn and is perhaps, in the
circumstances, our best contribution towards
the carrying on of the war.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I say that
because speeches very often are vain. To..day
it is action that counts, and the Government
is on the job.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: What the
leader of the House states is just this: "This
Western problemn is very difflcult; therefore
the Governrnent rnust solve it, and you must
be silent and let .it do so."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not say
that.
Right Hon. -Mr. MEIGHEN: The difficulty
of the problemn is aIl the greater reason-an
unanswerable reason-why the lines of solution, in the forma of a measure, should he submitted to hoth Houses. It is for such reasons
that the Houses of Parliament exist. They do
flot exist for mere formalities or silence, but for
work on legisîntion. If they do not fulfil that
function, dead indecil is the people that allows
them to live. Look through the statutes
passed during the years of the last war and
tell me if every session there was not legisiation of the most important character on every
subjeet of con6equence. We were busy then
too; our lights were lit ail hours of the night.
"Oh," it is said, "but this is far worse."
Everyone thinks his own problem the worst.
I arn not going to minîmize the heaviness of
the load, but the heavier it is, the greater
the reason why the two Houses should cooperate, not by silence, but by thought and
toil.
OTTAWA AGREEMENT BILL
TEIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 23, an Act to authorize an
Agreernent between His Mai esty the King and
the Corporation of the City of Ottawa.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, I
shall be very brief. First, I wish to express
my appreciation Vo the leader of the House
for having twice had the final passage of this
measure postponed in order that I might bave
an opportunity of making on it a speechwhich 1 have po intention of making.

105

If we were in normal times, I should certainly have reason on my side for stressing a
point I have already developed in this House,
namely, that this perennial grant of S100,000
by the Goveroment to the City of Ottawa in
lieu of taxation is inadequate. But we are
not in normal times, we are at war, and no
doubt the Council of the City of Ottawa
know, as we all do, that we must not divert
nor attempt, to divert fromn the public treasury
dollars which can 'be used elsewhere. We ail
know that in these days dollars .mean builets
and shells, acropianes and ships, and fialy
victory. For this reason I am sure the City
of Ottawa would not like me to raise my voice
at this moment to asIc for even a minimum
increase of the amount which is provided by
this Bill by way of allowance to the City of
Ottawa. 1 might express the hope-I amn sure
the City Council would agree-that the money
we! forgo this year will be used in such a
way that it wiil be of the utmost harmn to
the enemy.

There are no outside interests
concerned; so ne person will suifer by the
waiving of the seven days' notice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was jusf about
te ask my honourable friend whether he is
certain fhat ail persons interestedi in the Bill,
for or against, are agreeable

The purpose of

given a week's notice of the date when any

be brought before a committee te-morrow.
Is there a general understanding among ail

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes, I arn se inforrned.
Righf Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Or rather, is
flot this the situation, that fhere are ne diverse

I shahl be corrected, because if is an importanf
matter for us te dispense wifh notice of the

SECOND READING

Hon. L. COTE moved the second reading of
Bill C2, an Act to incorporate the Roman
Catholie Episcopal Corporation of James Bay.
H1e said: Honourable senators, this is a Bili
to incorporate the Right Reverend Henri
Belleau and his successors as a corporation
sole, under the name of the Roman Catholic
Episcopal Corporation of James Day. It
apýpears that the .iurisdiction of the Right
Reverend Henri Belleau, who is Vicar Apostolic
of the Vicariate Apostolic of James Day,
extends over two provinces; hence the necessity of seeking incorporation by Act of this
Parliament. When the Bill is read a second
time, I shahl move that it be reiferred to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As 1 am not
on the Private Dills Committee, I should like
to mention a point or two here. I presume this
Bihl is in the samne formi as many others of a
similar character, but one thing in it struck
me as rather peculiar. The church dignitary
to whom the honourable gentleman refers is
himself incorporated, and his successors in
that office succeed hinm as the incorporated
person fromn time to time. The corporation,
which consists of one man, is entitled to
becomne the owner of certain assets, the oniy
restriction being that the real estate assets
must flot have an annuai income value of over
$50,000. The thing that struck me as rather
odd was that although it is clearly contempiated that these assets wouid be of great
value and importance, they may he disposed
of by the one incorporated person with the
consent in writing of two clergymen chosen
by himself. That may he the method usuaily
adopted, but it does seem. to me somewhat
peculiar to include it in legisiation. We
compel the incorporated person to consult two
clergymen before disposîng of real estate,
but these clergymen ýhe rnay choose himself.
That is not much of a «check. Another odd
feature is that the Bihl doas not define what
is meant by a "clergyman." I should think
that under the present wordin-g the incorporated person could cali in a clergyman of
the United Church.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourabie senators, I
can assure the right honourahle gentleman that
the Bill is in the form usually followed in
snch cases. I am conversant with a great
14879--8j

many of the Acts incorporating dioceses in
Ontario, for instance, and ail these, whether
passed before Confederation, by the late
Province of Canada, or afterwards, by the
Legislature of Ontario, are in virtually the
samne words as these, and the provisions for
the disposai of property are likewise virtualiy
the samne in ail. The real purpose of incorporating the Archbishop of a diocese as a corporation sole is to give hlm by statute the
corporate status which in England a bishop or
the holder of a certain position in the church
has at common law, the right of succession
in law. He is given the right to hold lands,
to sue and he sued, and so on; in short, al
the rights of a corporation. In order to avoid
the trouble and inconvenience of havîng to
transfer to, his successor, upon the death of a
holder of a see, the property held by him. ini
trust for the diocese, this means has been
adopted by our legislatures almost fromn time
immemorial. If the expression "clergyman"
needs clarification, no doubt the memabers of
the Miscellaneous Private Buis Committee
will look after that.

Sauvé:
1. Whiereas the strength of the nation depends
especially upon the health of the Canadian
people;

inlividnal or souial,'is "life its'elf, its prest ivation and dev elopment";

SENATE

3. Whereas in this period of war, anguish
and excess, it is all the more urgent to prevent
disease by protecting and fortifying health;
Therefore, be it resolved that this House
respectfully recommends that the Department
of National Hea'lth of Canada do:(a) deal more severely with the elements
detrimental to health, especially with the
increasing misuse of broadcast advertisements
recommending panaceas or certain commercial
articles of food and drink;
(b) sec that the danger of the abuse of
unsuitable foods and beverages be taught widely
by the Press and the radio and in schools;
(c) spread knowledge of the properties of
wholesome foods and beverages.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable senators,
I have already extended well-deserved congratulations to the honourable member from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) on the able and
comprehensive manner in which he presented
his case and justified his stand in respect of
rational feeding. I do not deem it necessary, therefore, to repeat what I have already
stated on that score. I do, however, feel
more or less bound, as one of the representatives of the medical profession in this House,
to add a few brief remarks to what I have
said. I understand that some of my honourable confrères here also intend to speak on
the subject.
I am sure that my honourable friend froin
Rigaud is net, any more than any other
member of this honourable body, expecting
to have to listen to any scientific lecture
from the six or seven physicians who happen
te belong to this Chamber. But it is quite
obvious that, as members of a professional
fraternity which is naturally recognized as
the guardian of the health of the nationindividually, as active practitioners, and collectively, as members of various medical and
public health agencies-we cannot help being
deeply interested in the subject my honourable friend thought opportune to bring te
our attention.
Let me say, in the first place, that I accept
his well-founded assertions and that I fully
share his views on this matter of rational
feeding. His carefully prepared statements
bear witness to the fact that at least there
are, here and there, a few laymen who
understand the full value of properly directed
diets and "régimes alimentaires," and who
are even ready to follow, in so far as they are
personally concerned, the doctor's orders in
that respect. That, at least, I take for
granted.
May T at this point observe that my
honourable friend paid comparatively too
great attention to the hunger of the people
and not quite enough to their thirst. Far
be it from me to stamp myself as a total
abstainer or an advocate of total prohibition,
Hon.

Mr. BUCHANAN.

but may I say, in passing, that the'laws of
true temperance are too frequently violated,
irrespective of the liquor regulations imposed
by our various provincial governments.
I
refer particularly to Sunday drinking, and I
know what I am talking about. It would be
better indeed not to have any restrictions at
all than to have them disregarded, because
flagrant disobedience diminisies respect for
all law.
Just one more point before I conclude. I
wonder if it occurred to my honourable friend
that, speaking always from the standpoint of
social welfare in general, rational feeding is
but one aspect of the problems which are
confronting us now and which will confront
us to-morrow in a much more challenging way.
I grant, of course, that proper feeding in
infancy and childhood truly orientates the
whole life from a physical standpoint, and
that wholesome nutrition helps the human
body to achieve its full development and to
stand successfully the threat of many diseases.
In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that,
on this continent at least, more people die
from eating or drinking too much than from
actual starvation. But the physical welfare
of the people also depends on other factors,
namely, proper housing conditions, adequate
clothing, well-directed physical exercise, and
so forth. Every member of this House knows
what I am alluding to. A thorough discussion
of such correlated problems, however, would
carry me too far, and I shall dispense with
studying them at present. My point is that
if we do not prepare right now to face them
intelligently, and then act according to the
best interests of the nation, the social and
economic problems of to-day will be ten tines
harder te solve to-morrow-after this war is
over.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET (Translation):
The motion introduced by the honourable
seator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) has
my whole-hearted support. During his long
political career the honourable senator has
slown vision, courage and patriotism in the
study of social problems. Through the programme which he advocates and the health
reforms embodied in his motion we may
expcet social legislation based upon justice.
I wish to express my tianks to the honourable
senator, who is making every necessary effort
with a view to enabling our country to develop
her boundless resources as rapidly as possible.
In the peaceful contests that will come after
this war, public men, representatives of
medical and health associations and members
of the Senate will have an opportunity te
review and study the post-war problems.

APRIL 1, 1941
I must also thank and congratulate our
esteemed colleague from Essex (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse), who has made a generous contribution to this debate and brought forward
suggestions that will surely produce beneficial
results.

All my colleagues acknowledge the paramount importance of national health. I hope
a definite health policy will be set forth
through the combined action of the Dominion
and the provinces.
So far as I know, each province has a health
department, but a far more satisfactory result
would be secured if the Dominion and the
provinces were willing to work together. I
know that under present financial conditions
no effective assistance can be expected from
the Dominion Government. The federa'l
authorities are quite justified in refusing to
admit into this country persons who are sufferin from serious diseases. The Dominion Government should also recognize its duty to
maintain in good health those who are already
here. Some co-operative health scheme should
be worked out between the federal and the
provincial authorities.
In matters of health there is all too
frequently an unfortunate overlapping in
services.
My honourable colleagues will
perhaps have noticed such an overlapping in
agriculture. We have experimental farms and
demonstration stations, some of which are
under the control of provincial governments,
while others are maintained by the Dominion
Government. Health problems have a social
character and we shall never find a truly
national solution for them if we fail to adopt
a system involving fair and reasonable cooperation between the Dominion and the
provinces.
I was greatly interested in reading a study
prepared for the Royal Commission on
Dominion-Provincial Relations. The author
goes into the development and efficiency of
health services in Canada. The main responsibility as regards health protection devolves
upon the provinces, for that is a traditional
function of provincial governments, but the
Dominion has a special duty to discharge.
During the first forty years of this century
considerable development has been achieved
in the various branches of science. Medicine
has advanced wonderfully: surgeons display
more daring, cleverness and enterprise and
they are better equipped than formerly; health
experts have discovered efficient methods for
the control and prevention of contagious and
infectious diseases. Then there has been the
comparatively recent discovery of vitamins,
those factors which, through their well-defined
properties, enable human beings to secure
better nutrition, strengthen their health,

increase their energy and, in short, render
themselves more efficient. On the other hand,
chemistry, physics, electricity, agricultural
husbandry, botany and geology have not only
enabled physicians to obtain essential knowledge and secure better instruments, but have
also made it possible to organize our industrial
and economic life so as to ensure more
comfort and happiness.
In the dissemination of knowledge on
matters of hygiene the purpose is to impart
health information by methods that awaken
and stimulate the public mind and promote
healthy habits of life. This motion earnestly
recommends that the Minister of Health
should, through the Press, the radio, and the
schools, point out to the public how dangerous
is the careless use of improper foods and
beverages, and explain the properties of foods
and beverages which are to be recommended.
Through the Press and the radio, by the distribution of bulletins and with the co-operation
of various associations, we should bring within
the reach of the average citizen the knowledge
that we have on matters of hygiene.
In the light of historical knowledge it is
clear that those who drew the British North
America Act in 1867 could not foresee the
modern problems of public health; so we
should not be surprised if that Act says very
little about public health.
The teaching of hygiene and the study of
many health problems are within the jurisdiction of provincial governments.
I congratulate the honourable senator from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé) on his remarks
regarding the consumption of milk among
children and regarding the diseases caused by
malnutrition. The death rate among children
will never drop unless proper methods for the
care of mothers and infants are made known
to the public.
We ought to be proud of our young country,
for she has achieved considerable progress
in public health. However, in spite of that
constant improvement, Canada has a higher
death rate among children than any other
white nation of the British Empire. Here are
some figures:
1931, Canada-death rate among children. 85
1933, Canada-death rate among children. 75
1936, Canada-death rate among children. 66
1937, England-death rate among children 58
1937, New Zealandl-death rate among
children ...................

Provincial governments are endeavouring to
co-operate with the federal authorities with a
view to improving public health, which is
considered by all of us as the very basis of
national welfare, and consequently as a

110

SENATE

Preventive
matter of national importance.
measures are being taken, with a beneficial
effect upon the national health. In the prevention of disease, wonderful progress has
been achieved as regard tuberculosis, diphtheria and smallpox. Health units are bringing
to the knowledge of the public the best
methods of preventing disease. By visiting
the peopie in their homes, they ascertain what
improvements could bc made. In certain parts
of the country, that work has produced
wonderful results.
As regards health units, the province of
Quebec bas probably achieved more success
than any other area of Canada, and, to my
mind, that province deserves high praise for
the encouragement it has given to this work,
and for the good results derived from it.
Health units are also combating contagious
diseases, which, by the co-operation of local
physicians, can now be more quickly conThey are also distributing serum
trolled.
and vaccine. They inoculate children against
smallpox and dipltheria. In many areas,
thanks to the health units, all children have
against diphtheria. The
been inoculated
results have been wonderful.
Where do we stand as regards the fight
against cancer? That disease is increasing at
an alarming rate and is becoming an ever
more important cause of death.
In Canada all the provinces have launched
a great movement for the early diagnosis
and treatment of cancer. The diagnosis of
that disease requiring costly instruments, and
its treatment necessitating the use of radium,
the provinces have not bastened to open
clinics. Under the present circumstances the
programmes of cancer prevention are necessarily limited, in view of the travelling expenses that must be incurred in order that a
comparatively few clinics may be reached.
The fight launched many years ago against
tuberculosis is constantly expanding and is
giving results that are more and more encouraging. The province of Quebec is making
a great contribution in the fight against tuberculosis. Apart from fifteen field specialists,
the province maintains twelve sanatoria.
The combined effort of health experts,
physicians in charge of clinies, and antituberculosis associations, ensures efficiency in
the fight against that great plague. Unfortunately, quacks, inventors of secret medicines
and charlatans prey upon an unsuspecting
public and deceive sick people, offering them
spurious cures, the marvellous efficiency of
which they extol. Through the Press and the
radio the sick should be warned against quack
medicines and methods of treatment that are
extremely dangerous.
Hon. Mr. PAQUET.

I urge upon this House the necessity of
requesting the Federal Minister of Health to
take action with a view to dealing more
severely with elements that are endangering
health, and especially to stop the more and
moru common practice of advertising over
the radio various nostrums, foods or beverages.
Through the Press and the radio, as well
through the schools, the public should be
acquairted with the danger that lies in the
careless use of improper foods or beverages,
and they should be informed as to the
properties of safe foods and beverages.
The heads of health services in the various
provinces have a sincere desire to co-operate
with the Minister of Health in the creation
of a proper health organization.
Health
experts should take a deep interest in the
selection and inspection of food products and
beverages, such as milk and alcoholie liquors.
Health is essential to the full enjoyment
of life. In this connection we must resort
to the great discoveries that ensure a better
treatment of diseases. A notable invention
which has been developed in this country is
the use of insulin, discovered by Dr. Banting,
of Toronto, who recently died in an unfortunate accident. His death has meant to us
the loss of one of the most faithful, devoted
and intelligent servants of Canada.
We all recognize that no health problem is
more important to any nation than the question of child welfare.
In view of the development of industry,
especially during the war that is now raging,
I should perhaps make a few remarks upon
industrial hygiene. That is one aspect of
public health which, until the last few years,
had been neglected on this continent. Since
the passing
of workmen's compensation
laws, the heads of industrial plants must pay
attention to industrial hygiene. Without any
delay, technical and medical services were
organized in the greater industrial centres for
the study of problems connected with the
health of workmen, emphasis being placed on
prevention rather than cure. Thus is the
science of indu;trial hygiene being gradually
developed.
There is still much to be done in this field.
All important industrial centres should have
an industrial clinie or some organization that
would ensure the desired security. In Canada
the provinces of Ontario and Quebec are the
only ones that maintain industrial hygiene
services, and their development is not considerable as yet.
In industrial plants, increasing concern is
taken about the health of each workman. It
is imperative that well-defined rules should be
laid down in connection with lighting, ventilation, and industrial hazards.

APRIL 1, 1941
In heaith matters, administrative efficiency
is highly important. The staff must be
specially trained in health methods. Work in
the field of publie heaith is becoming increasingly important.
Success can be achieved onily through the
co-operation of the Dominion and the provinces, and such co-operation I shall neyer
cease to urge upon the Government.
On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the debate

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, a few nights ago I iistened on the
radio to Lord Halifax, who was speaking to
the Pilgrims in New York, and in his speech
he set forth what in his view were some of
the objectives for which we and the British
Empire, as democratie peoples, are fighting in
this war, and towards which we shaHl continue
to work when the war is ended. I have since
heard that -the Prime Minister of Great Britain
had acquiesced in these views expressed by
Lord Halifax. It seems to me that the Dill
now before us for third reading might very
weil be considered in respect to the proposai
to give the ordinary people of our democratie
worhd a squarer deai, possibly, in the future
than they have had, it may he, in the past.
I believe absoiutely that labour is worthy of
its hire, and that a business man is entitied
to reasonable compensation for his business
ability and activity. But what is proposed by
this particular Diii? A public utility company,
the British Columbia Telephone Company,
capitalized at $1O,00,000, has for 'the hast
twenty years or more, with a few exceptions,
paid 8 per cent te its common stockhoiders and
6 per cent to its preferred stockhoiders. It is
now proposed to increase the capital stock
from $10,000,000 te 820.c00,000. When this
morning the manager was asked if the expectation was to pay 8 per cent and 6 per cent,
respe'ctiveiy, on the higher capitaliStion, he
answered that they hoped to do so.
Now,- I am flot a financiai expert, and there
is much I do flot know about finance, but I
have been wondering whether in the hast
twenty years 6 per cent might not have been
reasona-ble compensation to the common stockholder, and whether, if the extra 2 per cent on
810,000,000 had been set aside during that
period as a Teserve, it wouid not have obviated
the necessity of now increasing the capital
stock to, $20,000,000.

Who is paying this money?
The charwoman, the labourer, the bricklayer, the railroad man, yes, and others in British Columbia

In my judgment such a proposai as this is
surely one of the things which in the view of
Lord Halifax and Winston Churchill should be
corrected, and I hope they will be corrected in
the coming years, when we geV a more reasonable application of those democratie principles

NAVAL, AND CARGO SHIP CONSTRUC0F
TION-BRITISH
PURCHASES
WAR MATERIAL IN CANADA
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he will direct the attention of the
Goverament to the construction of naval and
cargo ships in Canada, and the Britisb capital
invested in Canada in war inaterial.
11e said: Honourable senators, m-hen this
war broke out, I, likec aIl other good Canadians
in Parliament and outside of it, decided Vo
do everything 1 possibly could in my humble
way to support the efforts of Vue Government.
Many of these efforts have becn most commendable, but othcrs I do noV look upon s0
fav ourably. We are living under a democratic
system, with a free Parliarnent; therefore I
shaîl have opportunity Vo speak to you a littIe
laVer about this Government's programme of
shipbuilding, not only for the British Goverament, but also for Canada, and Vo make
reference to the Naval Service.
Since war broke out 1 have nt criticized
the Goveroment in any way, either in this
flouse or outside. I was amazed, therefore.
and disappointed, Vo read a condemnation of
Vhe shipbuilding programme of Vhe Union GovHon. Mr. MURDOOK.

eromient, which was pronounced by the Minister, Hon. Mr. Howe, when ha was speaking
on the presenit shipbuiilding programme in
another place. I say without fear of contradiction that his allegotions ogainst the shipbuilding progranmme of thîe Union Goveroment
are not only unfounded and unfair, but totally
inaccurate. I shahl quota frorn the Ministcr's
statenient.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
date?

Made on wvhat

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: About a weck
ago. I bave ot the exact date. lie said:
My reason for making tliat statement about
ships built in the last war is that those ships
have a very smaîl carrying capacity. IV bas
neyer been found possible Vooperate theni with
an aven break in expenses.
Hie said further:
We are hopeful that we cao geV ont soma
additional capacity, but I arn parfectly certain
that it must ha donc in an orderly way. \Ve
hiad an example in the last war of the Government rushming in laVe in the third year of the
war wvith a shipbuilding programme, which \vas
put out helter-skelter. Almost any sort of plant
that woulcl undertake a job, or accýept Government assistance, Vook a contract. Tfhe rcsult
wnas that thcy got some vary badly and
uuieconomically built boats.
We have heard a great deal froma the Government, and properly so, about the desirability of unity in this country, and I amn
astonished that a war Minister, weighted
down with two portfolios whien one would
saVm..fy the avecrage man, should go back, over
a quarter of a century to delve into the
records of the Union Government and make
,o many ohlegations which, as I Lave just
said, are most unfaîr.
In order Vo prove that there xvas nothing
lcVer-skel Ver about the programme, may I ha
perraitted to place before this honourable
Chamber the steps that the Goveroment took
or that time with great deliberation and care.
Honourable senators will recall that in 1917
the war wos at its most critical stage. Unrcstrictc'd
submarinc
warfare
had
been
launcbed by the Germons in its full fury, and
England, for the first time in the many wars
she had engaged in, liad Vo combat submarine
warfare on on enormous scale. The loss of
British tonnage xvas ccrtainly appohhing. The
loss in this wor has been great. but is nothing
compared to the loss in the losV war. The
battle of the Atlontic went on in 1917 just
as it is going on now, and the caîl of the
British Government was for ships, sbips, and
more ships. IV is truc that at that time the
Imperial Munitions Board were building ships
liere for Great Britain in a limited way. I

APRIL 2, 1941
say "in a limited way," because they could
place orders only when the berths in the
various Canadian shipyards became vacant.
The question of shipbuilding was under
review by the Union Government on more
than one occasion, and after it had been
considcrcd in every aspect, the Government
of that day, wisely, I think, decided to throw
its full effort behind a greater and more
speedy shipbuilding programme than the one
which was being carried on by the .Imperial
Mýunitions Board. The first thing the Goyern.
ment did after coming to that conclusion
was to instruct me to bring a programme
before Parliament. Honourable gentlemen on
the other side seem to have a dimmer view
of the supremacy of Parliament now than
thcy had in those days, and I doubt very
much thaf their proposed shipbuilding programme will come before Parliament. In any
event it feil to my lot to present our programme to Parliament, and 1 am happy to
say, as I have said on many previous occasions, it re-ceived unanimous approval, iicluding týhe approval of the late Hon, W. S.
Fielding and the late Hon. Rodolphe Lemieux,
who rose in their places in the flouse and
congratulated the Governrnent on its shipbuilding programme.
After obtaining the approval of the Government and of Parliament, what was the next
step? I called into my office that very wise
and able Deputy Minister, Mr. Alex. Johnson
-and here I want to say that for the successful carrying out of that shipbuilding programme in ail its various phases full credit
is due to him, and very littie to me. 1
also had the assistance of an able naval
architect, the late Mr. Duguid. We laid down
certain principles at that meeting, namely:
(1) that the ships were to be of British
design; (2) that the specifications were to
be British; and (3) that the ships were to
he built on the basis of a flxcd price per
ton. In this connection I would recommend
to the present Minister, although I do not
suppose he wants any advice from me, or is
likcly to take it, that he place his orders
for ships on the basis of a fixed price per ton.
Our neighbours to the south, who were carrying out a much larger steel shipbuilding
plan than we were, built on a cost-plus basis,
the result being that their cost was $50 per
ton more than ours and their ships were not
as well built. If I had the responsibility
now, I would not place orders on a fee
basis either.
The next step my department took in this
"helter-skelter" programme, as the Minister is
pleased to caîl it, was to notify ail shiphuilders
in Canada that the Government had complete

113

contirol of their berths and that they must not
take orders except from the Dominion
Government.
Then we made another quick move, and
placed àn order for ships' plates in the United
States at a most favourable price. The greatest
difficulty was being experienced at that time
in placing orders for ships' plates. To such an
extent was this so that my department had to
keep a mnan in Pittsburgh, and another in
Philadeiphia, to use their best endeavours to
get as great a supply of ships' plates as possible.
I have now traced 'our initial procedure step
by step. The Minister says bis system is
going to be an orderly one. 1 wonder how
he would define the system I have just described other than as an orderly one. Hie
seems to think it was not; and when he states,
as I have just read, that orders were placed
with every shipyard under a Government suhsidy, whether those shipyards, were equipped
for turning out ships or not, I desire to say
that the Government neyer paid out one
dollar in subsidy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Furthermore,
Mr. Howe says that our ships were too small.
Let us examine into that. At Halifax two
ships were built, each of 10,500 tons dead
weight carryimg capacity, with three decks.
and having a sea speed of thirteen knots.
They were steered by steam, telemotor and
hand. As to our cargo ships, Canada spent
more money on ber ships than is generally
spent, and 1 can say without boasting that
they were the flnest ever built. The sailors
had better quarters than usual, and the
kitchen arrangements were excellent.
In addition to the two ships of 10,500 tons
which 1 have mentioned, we huilt twenty-four
ships, 'tween decks, each with a dead weight
tonnage carrying capacity of 8,450 tons and a
sea spced of eleven and a haîf knots. These
ships were built at Point Levis, Montreal,
Victoria and Prince Rupert. We buiît at
Three Rivers two more ships of 5,500 tons
each. Therefore the country had, as you will
note from the particulars I am giving you,
twenty-eight finely buîlt ships, all of them
large, notwithstanding the fact that the
Minister said they were small ships and were
badly built. In addition to these large ships,
several ships of 3,750 tons dead weight were
built on the Great Lakes. They could not be
of a larger tonnage, as they had to conform.
to the canal draught -of fourteen feet. I do
not dlaim that these were economnical ships
for trans-ocean service, but they were al
right for ooastwise trade.

SENATE

When the Minister made that statement he
not only criticized the Union Government, but
he slapped the shipbuilders who constructed
those fine ships, and the workmen who
laboured so skilfully in turning them out. I
never received a single complaint against
those ships, and I challenge the Minister to
produce a single complaint that he or anybody
else ever received that would justify him in
saying thev were badly built.
I read wlat the Minister has to say from
time to time about shipbuilding, and I notice
lie states there is a great scarcity of skilled
labour. The Minister operates in a way that
diffirent fron that of most Ministers of
the Crown, and entirely different from the
way I operated. J believe that when such
problens come to bis department the Minister
ought to keep thern within the department,
where, as in all Goveirnent departments,
there are efficient civil sertants. The Minister
takes a different view, and he bas appointed
innumerable commisittees. I am not criticizing
him for doing so if he thinks that is advisable. He has appointed as ship controller a

Mr. Car owell, who at the present time is
traveling fron Halifax to Vancouver to see
what information lie can gather that would
justify the Canadian Government in proceeding with a vigorous policy of building British
ships and possibly ships under Canadian
registry. IIow the Minister can afford to lose
a day or even an hour in these critical times,
I cannot understand. In my opinion it would
be better to call the shipbuilders of Canada
to his office and say to them, "Gentlemen,
this is the type of ship that we want built,
and we want delivery made as quickly as
possible." Then the orders should be placed
with these people, and they should be told,
as we told them, "The department is behind
you te the fullest extent and will give you
every possible support." I do not know what
has been done, and when the honourable
leader of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
replies to me, as he may do to-day or later,
I wish he would tell this Chamber whether
any of the eiglteen British ships of 9,000 tons
havc been ordered or not, and, if se, when
delivery may be expected. I should also like
him to tell us when it is intended to make a
start on the building of ships under Canadian
registry.
The Minister contradicts himself. He says
that ships of 10,000 and 8,000 tons are so
small they have net proved economical. Yet
the honourable leader told us last week, from
his place in this House, that if Canadian ships
were built the tonnage would be 4,800 tons.
I do net claim to be an expert, but from
knowledge that I had during the last war
and from information gained fror shipping
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

people, I should consider a ship of that size
aitogether too small. The proper type of
ship to be built, from an economical point
of view, is one of either 10,000 tons or 8,000
tons. When we lau'nched our shipbuilding
programme, none of the Canadian yards had
ever built steel ships as large as 8,000 or 10.000
tons. But now they have that experience.
As I have already stated, they performed
their task admirably during the last war and
built fine ships. XVell, tley certainly could
do so again, and I for one do not see any
reason for delay in getting on with the work.
Why not place orders with these sliipbuilders
and tell thern to go right abead? What are
our American friends doing? They have got
an order from the British Covernment for
450 cargo ships, of the fabricated type. The
American Government is saying to United
States shipbuilders, "1Ve want these ships
built just as speedily as possible, and if you
finish them within the time specified the
Government will pay you not only the agreed
price, but a bonus as weil." Why canot we
in this country act quickly? Why have not
orders already been placed, and why are net
more being placed? Surely the urgency exists.
I do net want to spend too ucieh time on
the subject of shipbuilding. After referring to
one more point, I will pass on. Honourable
senators will recall that in 1936 the Minister
decided to sell Canada's largest and best
ships. Personally I think he made, not a
sale, but a gift. The price was 85 a ton.
There was read here, by the honourable leader
of this House, the mernorandum which was
prepared for the purpose of supporting the
Minister's action. The prospective purchasers
said, in effect: "These are old ships, obsolete
ships. If we buy them they will be sent
immediately to the scrap heap, and that will
be the end of therm. So we cannot afiord to
give you even $5 a ton for themî"-although
the larger ones cost $2,000.000-"unless you
give us the Australian route." That was the
route which the Canadian National Steanships people had worked up for sixteen years,
until it reached a profitable business. as shown
by Mr. Hungerford's estimate of annual net
profits of $700,000.
After those ships were sold I made up my
mind te try to find out what really happened
to them. It was a difficult task, but at last
I got a letter giving me some information.
I cannot state where the letter came from,
nor who wrote it, but this is the way it reads:
The following six steamers were purchased
by the combined interests of the following firms:
Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Company,
Commonwealth and Dominion Line. The Federal

Steam Navigation Company, Lonsdon.
The three larger ones, 10,000 ton dead weight
carrying capacity, and the other three, 8,450;

APRIL 2, 1941

115

APRIL 2, 1941

115

two of these were coal burners and four oil
burners, and all of them have now been sold,
the last one being the "Canadian Cruiser."
Honourable senators will remember reading
in the newspapers some time ago that this ship
had been sunk, in the Indian Ocean, I think,
by the Germans. She certainly was not under
Canadian nor British registry. While I know
the flag under which she was flying, it would
not be wise for me to reveal it. The letter
goes on:
The price paid for these steamers was very
low, especially as it included the trade as well,
which proved to be very profitable for the
companies involved. In addition to this the
steamers were sold for considerably more
money than was paid for them, from 50 to 100
per cent more. My own opinion, which you can
take for what it is worth, is that the Canadian
Government should never have sold these ships
and the trade at such a ridiculous low figure.
Well, the steamers are gone. A question
about their sale was raised in another place,
and the opinion was expressed, that it would
haave been better if they had not been sold.
In reply the Minister said he thought he had
done a very good job, and he was glad he did
not have that type of ship now, notwithstanding the great need for ships.
J come now to the proposal to build ships
under Canadian registry. In the official records
I read that the Government was going to build
destroyers in this country. I was astonished
at that. A destroyer costs at least $5,000,000
and takes more than two years to build. Canada is not adapted for the building of destroyers. We have not the necessary 4-7 inch
guns, nor the anti-aircraft guns, nor the special
type of marine engines. The great need of
the hour is for cargo ships. A cargo ship of
large size can be constructed and launched
within from eight to nine nonths; and the
Government could have three or four of these
vessels constructed for the cost of a single
destroyer. I should like to suggest to the
Government that it give up the idea of trying
to build destroyers here and coneontrate on
cargo ships.
Speaking on the subject of destroyers, I
want to say that no man is prouder than I
am of the Canadian Navy. I have always
had an intense interest in our Navy, from the
time when Sir Wilfrid Laurier first made
provision for it on the Statute Book, which I
think was back in 1910. When our officers
and ratings have passed through naval colleges
and completed their training, they are second
to none. I was gratified indeed on two visits
that I made to the Old Country, one during
the last war and the other afterwards, te hear
the Sea Lords speak in such high terms of the
efficiency of our Canadian naval officers and
men. But I do not know why our Government does net give due credit te the Royal

Navy for the convoy work it is doing at
present. It is fair to say that since the war
broke out not a troopship nor a convoy could
have left a Canadian port without the protection of the British Navy and, while France
was an ally, the French Navy. Their largest
battleships and cruisers have escorted our
ships across the ocean. The other day the
Minister eulogized the Canadian Navy, stating
that over 3,000 ships, of a total tonnage of
23,000,000 tons, had been convoyed across the
Atlantic by the Canadian Navy. I am sorry
the Minister did not say that this was done
with the co-operation of the Royal Navy. It
is well known that destroyers and aircraft
accompany convoys only part of the way from
this country, and that then larger ships of
the Royal Navy pick up the convoys and
conduct them across te the point on the other
side where they are met by destroyers again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me? I have followed fairly
closely all that bas been said about the escorting of convoys, and this is the first time that
I have heard it said that credit bas been given
te the Royal Canadian Navy exclusively for
this fine work. I always thought the fact was,
as my honourable friend bas just stated, that
the Royal Canadian Navy convoys go only
part of the distance across.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am glad the
opinion of the honourable leader opposite
agrees with mine.
I desire to touch on only one more
subject. Since the war broke out more than
$300,000,000 of British capital bas been
expended in this country. We are delighted
to have it. In the voluminous reports which
the Press Bureau sends us from time to time
I notice that when a list of contracts is
given, though they may be British contracts
involving millions of dollars of expenditure.
the only designation is "Covernment." The
average man on the street may infer that
Why
this is really Canadian expenditure.
does the Bureau net indicate that certain
contracts are of British origin by placing
opposite them the initials G.B. or U.K., for
I
Great Britain or the United Kingdom?
would suggest to ny honourable friend that,
if he bas any influence with the Press Bureau.
he prevail upon its officials te show in its
list of contracts those that are Canadian and,
in all fairness, also specify those that are
British.
Last night we heard the honourable leader
opposite state that the Canadian Government had suffered many delays in the handling
of contracts through not getting information
from the British Government. Some of the
delays might be due to changes in design of

SENATE

116

tanks or aircraft or to failure to supply blueprints. These changes are not to be wondered at, because after the battle of France
the British Government no doubt found it
necessary to alter its specifications for tanks
and probably also for aircraft. But I do
not think it is at all wise for us to mise
questions of delay and criticize our senior
partner in the Commonwealth of Nations.
I do not know whether the honourable
leader opposite is aware of the fact that the
Canadian Government bas at times seriously
delayed the placing of contracts here by the
British Government. Occasionally the delay
has extended into months, when it should
have been cut down to days or weeks. I
have chapter and verse for this, but I refrain
from going into details, since it is not wise
to do so while a war is on. Let me add that
though we may criticize the British Government for delaying us, I have never heard of
any member of the British Government
cemplaining in the Imperial Parliament of
delays in the placing of contracts here because
of want of prompt action by the Canadian
Government.
Honourable
lIon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, it will be my duty to draw the
attention of the Minister of Munitions and
Supply to my honourable friend's statement.
I hope to obtain for my honourable friend
information from the Minister covering the
points dealt with.

Precious Metals Marking Act.
He said: This Bill contains some technical

APRIL 2,1941
The first amendment affects bracelet watch
cases, but only to the extent that it removes
the necessity for soldering a sheet of gold on
the inside of the back of a gold-filled bracelet
watch case.
The second amendment deals with the
establishment of a new standard for goldfilled eyeglass wares, and protection for the
public as to the quality of the content of the
article.
I may add that the amendments have the
entire approval of the following provincial
associations: British Columbia Optometric
Association, Alberta Optometrie Association

Manitoba Optometric Society, the Optometrical Association of Ontario, Association of
Optometrists and Opticians of the Province
of Quebec, New Brunswick Optometrical
Society and Nova Scotia Optometrical
Association.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: From
my study of the measure, which is obviously
of minor importance, I find it has but one
purpose, namely, to protect the public in
respect of representations appearing on articles
of jewellery, especially watches, as to their
composition, it being impossible for any person
by mere physical examination to know whether
or not those representations can be relied on.
Custom in watches has changed, except with
some of us more old-fashioned people. Wrist
watches have taken the place of pocket
watches. Consequently the verbiage of the
Act does not apply so accurately as it did.
I think I apprehend the purpose of the Bill.
It is mainly to remodel the Act in certain
particulars to make it apply and have real
meaning as respects wrist watches, whereas
the old Act applied mainly to pocket watches.

NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 13, an Act respecting
the appointment of Auditors for National
Railways.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
Bill which, according to law, must come to
Parliament annually. It provides for the
appointment of auditors under the Canadian
National-Canadian Pacific Act of 1933. The
Minister who brought down the Bill was asked
if the auditors were the same as last year,
and if they were operating under the sarne
conditions. His answer was that the auditors
were the same and that the compensation also
was the same. I believe the Bill is exactly the
same as the Bill of last year. The compensation is $50,000, and I believe that a small
fee is added to cover subsidiary companies
such as the Canadian National Steamships and
the Trans-Canada Air Lines. This is the
information given in another place. I move
second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have been rather struck
by the amount of thé auditors' fee, $50,000
for the Canadian National Railways alone.
The leader of the House has said there are
additional fees for subsidiaries. Well, there
is an endless family of subsidiaries, a family
bigger than any other in Canada. I should
like to know what the total cost is going to
be, and whether any effort is being made to
bring it within less startling limits. I had
rather thought we might hear from the
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) on the subject.
I am under
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the impression that the Bill bas gone through
in past years as a matter of course, and I
think that we, who do not have to deal with
such an immense amount of book-keeping and
accounting as is represented in our Canadian
National railway system, should not be surprised at the figure named, because it would
be in payment of the services of a large staff
who, in superintending this whole system,
carry on from January to December.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: One should
not speak dogmatically unless one knows, but
I have no doubt that the Canadian National
Railways have a very thorough internal audit
system. If they have not, they should have.
With such an audit system the duties of the
supervisory auditors, Touche and Company,
should not be so very onerous, although they
do involve responsibility. I should be sur-

lis

number appointed hy Parliament. 1 think
the House is entitlcd to fuit information. 1
hav e nothing against this firm, whichi is an
excellent one and lias been in existence for
a very long time, but it would seem to me
that if there is a thorough internai audit
this other audit may be more or less routine.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I shiah draw
the remarks of my right hononrable friend
to the attention of the Minister, along witli
the suggestion that the special or standing
committec of the House of Commons on the
finances of the Canadian National Railways
should examine into thiat feature.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Are you sure
it is even standing?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn sure we
have heard. an echo of what it has been doing.
I amn quite sure also that members of Parliament, who represent the shareholders of the
Canadian National railway system, could very
well ask for a report on the xvork being done.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I have always taken a good deal of interest
in the Canad-ian National Railways, baving
been at one time chairman of the committee
on that subject. I -shouid agree with the
right honourable gentleman that $50,000,
taken by itself, i's a -considerable sumn. But,
after ail, everything is relative, and I should
think that if the right honourable gentleman
were ta compare the $50.000, in relation to
the total business of the Canadian National
railway system, with the cost of auditing in
relation to the total business of some smaller
system, hie would find that the amount to be
paîd in this case is nat too large.
Fifty
tbousand dollars, after aIl, will psy for only
a comparatively smail staff of experts, and
experts are required to do the work. No
doubt the Canadian National Railways bave
an efficient internaI audit. and I should be
very maich surprised if it did not cost more
than $50,000. Ia any event, wbat the people
want is an cntirely independent audit conducted by aud-itors who are flot under the
contrai of the Canadian National Railways,
as any initernai auditors imust be. I aril confident that the audit bias neyer cost less than
$50,000.

TRANS-CANADA

AIR LINIES BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DA'NDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 26, an Act to amend the
Trans-Canada Air Lines Act,' 1937.
He said: Honotirable senators, the short
explanatory note on this Bill says:
The abject of the Bill is ta extend for a
farthier period from the Ilet December, 1940,
ta the 3lst Marcb, 1'942, the initial period
during whieb the rate or rates for the transport
of mails shahl he flxe(l hv the terms of the
contraet madle betwcen Rlis Majesty the Kin~
represente(l therein by the Postmiaster Genera,
aiid the Corporation.

APRIL 2, 1941
The Bill also provides for changing the
current year, as defined in the said Act, in
respect of which the rate or rates for the
transport of mails is to be fixed at the expiry
of the initial period, from the calendar year
to the Government fiscal year ending the
31st March.
Here is a more extended explanation by the
Minister:
The Bill has the effect of further extending
the date after which the rates for the carriage
of mail by Trans-Canada Air Lines will be fixed
automatically by the financial results of the
preceding year. Our difficulty in applying the
automatic feature is that the traffic is growing
very rapidly on Trans-Canada Air Lines, and
the mileage operated is growing to meet the
requirements of the traffic.
In the year ending December 31, 1940, about
5,000,000 miles were operated by Trans-Canada
Air Lines, and the plans for the fiscal year
1941-42 call for the operation of well over
7,500,000 miles, or more than 50 per cent
increase in the mileage flown. Of course the
greater mileage and the increasing traffic
increase the operating profits of the company.
Based on the operating results of last year, the
automatic feature of the Bill would fix a rate
of fifty-three cents a mile for the mail rate for
1940-41. We feel, however, that in view of
the increased mileage and the steady increase
in business on the line we can do rather better
than that for the Post Office, and the objective
will be to fix a. rate of not fifty-three cents
a mile, but forty cents a mile, as the basic
mail rate, which is a reduction of course from
sixty cents a mile to forty cents.
Last year the earnings of the Air Lines, after
aIl write-offs and interest on investment, was
something over $500,000. This year it is anticipated that the earnings from air mail based on
the increased mileage and the 40-cent rate will
be $3,153,000. The passenger revenue will be
$2,170,000. Miscellaneous revenue, comprised
chiefly of express, will amount to $250,000,
giving - a total gross revenue of $5,573,500.
Operating expenses are anticipated to be
$5,315,477, giving an operating income of
$258,032, less interest on capital, and other
income charges of $197,500.
That leaves us
with an estimated surplus of $60,523.
The question is asked, "After depreciation?"
and the Minister replies: "Yes; depreciation
is an operating charge." Then he is. asked
what it is figured at, and he continues:
At 25 per cent of the value of the aeroplanes,
engines and flying equipment; I believe the
rate is 10 per cent on the buildings. I might
say that throughout the period of the operation
of Trans-Canada Air Lines we have had a steady
increase in the poundage of mail carried, subject
to seasonal variations. Over an average period
the increase in the amount of mail carried bas
been at the rate of 4 per cent per month, a
very steady increase. Anticipating that this
increase will continue throughout the fiscal year
1941-42, we have reached the point where the
Post Office wi<ll almost break even on revenue
as against expense, counting four cents of the
six cents charged for air mail as revenue to
the air mail, and two cents as the cost of the
Post Office for the collection and distribution
of the mail. A very slight increase in mail
beyond the normal increase will balance the

119

books, and we anticipate that in the following
fiscal year the Post Office will make a profit
on the sale of air mail stamps.
Then there is the question, "On the basis of
forty cents?" and the Minister continues:
Yes. We have also brought the cost of carrying air mail down to about the level that is
current in the United States. I may say that
this is something of a freak, because our
equipment costs us about 50 per cent more
than similar equipment in the United States,
since we pay duty, sales tax and all other
charges on the equipment when we bring it
into Canada. Also we are charged higher rates
for gasoline than are paid by air lines in the
United States.
For purposes of comparison, the mail rate
on the Trans-Continental and Western Air Line,
from New York to Los Angeles, via Chicago, is
forty cents a mile; on the Canadian Colonial
Airways, from New York to Montreal, forty
cents per mile;

on Northeast Airlines,

from

Boston to Caribou, Maine, thirty-six cents per
mile; and on Northwestern Airways, Minneapolis -to Winnipeg, thirty-seven cents per mile.
Therefore, while passing through the development period, in the brief time Trans-Canada
bas been in operation we have succeeded in
getting the mail rate down to a comparable
basis with similar services in the United States.
We have succeeded in building up a volume
of mail much more quickly than had ever been
ant-icipated.
When we started the line we
anticipated that five years must elapse before
the Post Office could break even on its operations, but we are on the point of achieving
that in about three years' operation, and we
shall have at the end of the year a service that,
I think, will be adequate for the business of
Canada. Of course, this will always be an
expanding service, but at the end of this expansion the changes will be more normal and the
automatic feature of the Act will then operate
quite properly.
This Bill makes one other change in the
situation. The fiscal year of Trans-Canada Air
Lines is the calendar year, and formerly it was
provided that any change in rates would take
place on January 1, but there were operating
difficulties in getting the data to fix the new
rate on January 1. It usually takes from one
month to six weeks to close the books of TransCanada, and there was also the difficulty of
the Post Office budgeting for a fiscal year when
there might be a change in the rate in the
last three months of the fiscal year. Therefore. the Bill provides that hereafter the rate
established under the automatic feature for the
carriage of mail shall extend from March 31
in one year to March 31 in the following year.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, there is one feature of the
balance sheet which I did not catch, if the
honourable leader of the House mentioned
it at all. In the calculation for the profit and
loss statement, what rate of interest was
eharged on the capital which the country has
invested in this company?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amount of
interest is stated here, but I should need to
know the capital to compute the rate.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: What is the
amount of interest?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister

with an estimated surplus of $60,523.
The interest would be less than $197,500, since
other income charges are included in that.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All this air
traffic is taken away from the railways.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The rate is
not stated there at all, and everything depends
on that. Without it, the figures mean nothing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

The

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: The fairness
of the statement depends entirely upon the
rate charged upon the capital.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can have the
rate ascertained for my right honourable
friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As shown by
the statement read, the small operating profit
is at the expense of the Post Office Department. So far, Trans-Canada Air Lines have
been subsidized by the Post Office Department, instead of directly out of the Treasury,
and the subsidies have been heavy. Suppose
business does increase and the rate is reduced
to 40 cents, we should not imagine that we
are making money out of this venture, for the
business is taken away from some other enterprise, in which we are just as vitally interested.
The business is taken away from our railways,
whichi we have to subsidize year after year.
Just wait until the war business is over, and
then you will know what that means. We
are subsidizing two companies, each competing
with the other.

This is not my

Hon. Mr. KING: It would have gone to
the United States, anyway.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A part of it,
that is true.
Hon. Mr. KING: A great part of it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And it would
have been far more economical for Canada to
have it donc there.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am surprised to hear
my right honourable friend say that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: There is a
certain pride in having our own line, of
course, but to say that it is a paying venture
is net to look at it in a cold, matter-of-fact
way. And the business that it gets is taken
away from our other transportation enterprise, in whieh we have almost a 100 per cent
interest.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But if the Government
were not operating an air line, undoubtedly
private air lines would be carrying the mails
and other traffic; so the railways would suffer
just the same. And you must inake some
concession to progress.
Ri.ght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. But I
would let private lines do the business.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am very glad to see
that the rate charged to the Post Office Department is to be reduced, I think, to 40 cents.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That reductien has net been made yet, but hopes are
high.
Hou. Mr. EULER: I happen to have been
in the Post Office Department for alnost a
year, and I am free to say I rather felt that
the rate fixed at that time gave Trans-Canada
Air Lines a little advantage at the expense of
the Post Office Department, and that in fact
the department was carrying some of the
deficit on the operation of the Air Lines.
That was probably the case, but it was a
matter of poliey. It was thought Wise to
develop air mail facilities, and in one sense
it did net matter what the rate was, because
the amount charged against the Post Office
Department went to the credit of the Air
Lines, and both these institutions are Government owned. Nevertheless I shal be pleased
if the rate is reduced to 40 cents, because I
think this will be much closer to the actual
cost of carrying the mail.

something deserving the admiration of lumanity. They never will be.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
should like to ask the honourable leader what

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But if the mails
were carried by a private company the Post
Office Department would be charged a certain
amount, the company's dividend would not
accrue to the Government, and the railway
would have to face the competition just as
now.

that theso air lines will ever be a commercial

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: The depreciation

On the Order:

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I should
assume that loss is covered in some insurance
charge. Depreciation does flot include loss.
-Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: There is an item
of "self insurance reserve," $206,827.24.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Does that refer to alI
the Orders for second reading of Divorce

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

until April 10.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: A machine was lost not
so long ago. How much did that one cost?
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND: I take it for
granted that the honourable gentleman's question is directed to the Minister, and I shaîl
endeavour to have an answer presented to
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSFN: The right honourable leader opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meigheii)
asked what the rate of interest is on the
capital invested. That, I think, is made clear
in the annual report of Trans-Canada Air
Lines. I observe that the capital investment
represented hy common stock issued amounts
to $3,750,000, and the amount of interest on
capital invested, ýcharged against the income
account, is $187,500. If my calculation is
correct, that interest is at the rate of 5 per
cent on -invested capital, which seems to me
fair enougb.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My recollection is that the initial investment was
35,000.000.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: But only 75 per
cent of the capital stock has been called.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The honourable gentleman from Winnipeg South-Centre MHon. Mr.
Haig) asked what was the cost of one of these
aircraft. In the company's annual report I
see listed under expenditures on property and
equipment, "Purchase of six Lockheed Lodestar aircraf t-complete,
$925,3172"
That
averages a little over $150,000 each.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I know; but the
Bill will be befone us wben we do sit.
Hon. Mn. HAIG: Yes. I know the honourable gentleman bas objection to this petition being granted. I may say quite candidly
that I do not share bis objection. When the
facts are presented to honourable senators,
I do not think they will support the honourable gentleman's motion. I believe it would
be preferable to discuss the matter now and
settle it, because no further evidence wilh be
forthcoming between now and April 10.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Chairman of
the Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Robinson)
came to rny office this momning and suggested
I request that this Order stand, so, that
certain farts in relation to the c~ase might
in the meantime be suhmitted to the Department of Justice. Otherwise I should have
been perfectly willing that we proceed with
it. Honourable members may ask why the
Departmenit of Justice bas to deal with the
matter. I reply, because the petitioner is
not a citizen of Canada, nor were any of
the witnesses who appeared in support of bier
petition.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I do not think
there is any such person as a "citizen of
Canada."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right; British

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: One does net need
to be a British subject to get a divorce by
private bill, or judgment of a court.
I have a letter
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
from the Commissioner of Immigration in
reply to an inquiry I addressed to him. The
correspondence is in my office, and I will send
for it. I should be quite willing to discuss
the matter now, but the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee, after consultation, decided
that we should submit the case to the Department of Justice. Of course I acquiesced in that
decision.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: May I explain,
honourable senators, that J would not assume
to say I had any right to submit this case
to the Department of Justice. The Bill is
based on a report of the Divorce Committee.
Before J could take the course suggested I
should have to get authority from the other
members of the committee. So far as I am
concerned, J would rather see the matter
dealt with now.

What is the

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
The honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
says the petitioner is not a citizen of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And the question is, Have we a right to grant her a
divorce?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I did net expect
this matter would come before us now. As I
have said, rny papers are in my office. However, I have just sent for them. When they
are before me I shall be able te put the case
before the Senate in a nutshell. Of course, I
shall be willing to abide by the decision of
honourable members, but I may say that I
strenuously object to making the Senate
Divorce Committee a Reno divorce millfor that is exactly what we may be doing.
In this case we have a lady divorced in
Austria, then married again in Vienna to a
young man eight years ber junior. They
travelled togeher for a number of years and
visited various cities in Europe, but eventually
he tired of ber, and she discovered he was
hobnobbing with other ladies. This petitioner
bas a wealthy stepfatber, residing in New
York, a refugee from Czechoslovakia, a
gentleman who bas shown a disposition te
advance this lady all the money she needed.
The communication I received from the
Commissioner of Immigration shows that she
came into Canada last summer with $20,000.
ler brother-now living in Toronto-and his
wife entered the country with $100,000.
lon. Mr. MURDOCK.

An Hon. SENATOR: No; $200,000.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I thought it was
$100,000. J can put the case in a nutshell by
placing on Hansard my representations in the
matter. In March I wrote the following letter
to Mr. Blair:
Ottawa, Ontario,
March 19, 1941.
Mr. F. C. Blair,
Director of Immigration,
Department of Mines and Resources,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Blair,I am enclosing herewith the record of a
divorce case heard by our Divorce Committee,
of which I am a member, the other day.
It is my judgment that this lady, Alice Weill
Sedlak, was not a Canadian citizen at the time
she made a.pplication for this divorce, and I
doubt if, under your regulations, she is even
now a Canadian citizen. The record discloses
that Mrs. Sedlak was a divorced woman before
she married Mr. Sedlak, and she evidently, in
varions countries of Europe, for a number of
years supported Mr. Sedlak on money given to
ber by ber stepfather, a wealthy individual
who, I understand, is now with his wife, located
in New York. It seems to me that we are going
fer afield if, under the circumstances of divorce
cases before the Senate in Canada. we undertake
to grant a divorce to someone coming from a

foreign land, and not a citizen of Canada, who
happens to have, or can secure, the substantial

amount of money necessary to go through the
form of petitioning for, securing witnesses for,
and paying legal expenses for a divorce.
What I would be glad to have from you
before the 25th, if consistent, is a statement
indicating if this wonan is a citizen of Canada,
as I personally object to establishing the Senate
Divorce Committee on the same basis as the
Reno divorce mill.
Thanking you in advance for your advice, I
remain
Yours sincerely,
James Murdock.
This is Mr. Blair's reply:
Ottawa, March 20, 1941.
Dear Mr. Murdock,.I am in receipt of your letter of yesterday
with enclosure, regarding the divorce application of Alice Weill Sedlak, whose Canadian
status you would like to know.
Our information about Mrs. Alice Sedlak,
who gave her name on arrival in Canada in
September, 1939, as Alicia Doris Scelak, dates
from July, 1939. when Mr. Leopold Pilzer,
then in ivew York, applied for the admission
to Canada of certain relatives, including a
stepson, Joiannes Weill and a stepdaughter.
Mrs. Alice Sedlak, both of whom were supposed
to b fairly well,to-do. We were advised that
Johannes Weill would have between $100,000
and $150,000 and Mrs. Sedlak would have
approximately $20,000.
Leopold Pilzer was lescribed as a wealthy
and well-known manufacturer of
bentwood
furniture and the principal in a firm founded
in Vienna in 1830, with branches in varions
European countries, as well as the United
States. It was supposed that Mr. Weill was
interested in setting up a similar business in

123

APRIL 2, 1941
Canada. We later learned that the source
of Mr. Weill's wealth was Mr. Pilzer. We
t
were · old that Mrs. Sedlak had been separated
from ber husband and that a divorce was
pending.
Mrs. Sedlak was granted temporary entry
to Canada on the 15th September, 1939. Her
$20,000 was transferred to this country in the
same mon-th. The temporary immigration statue
granted to Mrs. Sedlak on the 15th September,
1939, was changed by Order in Council of
the 31st January, 1940.
You ask whether Mrs. Sedlak is a Canadi-an
citizen. The answer is that she is not. The
teri "Canadilan citizen" is defined in the Immigration Act -as meaning a British subject (a)
born in Canada, or (b) born abroad and
domiciled in Canada or (c) an alien naturalized
in Canada. Mrs. Sedlak could not become a
Canadiýan citizen without first becoming a
British subject and since she had had no
residence known to us, in any British country
other th-an Canada, she will require to have
five years Bri.tish resi.dence, as one of the
qualifications for naturalization.
Mrs. Sedlak is now legally resident in this
country and at the end of five years from
the date of ber landing, will acquire domicile
and may make application for naturalization.
She is now in process of acquiring domicile.
Yours very truly,
F. C. Blair,
Director.
Honourable James Murdock.
The Senate,
Ottawa, Ontario.
I would direct the attention of honourable
members to this letter. I may add that I
shall not be greatly offended if you decide
that we are to go into this kind of business,
but I think it will be a mistake, for the
reason that if this lady had been the daughter
or the wife of a brakeman, a labourer or a
mechanie, she would not have got very far.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE:

Bunk.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Hon. Mr. LITTLE:

No, it is not bunk.

Yes, it is buncombe.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Besides, she would
not have lad the wherewithal to get the legal
advice and assistance that she secured. The
evidence before the committee is that the
husband never was in Canada. He and a
woman who was not his wife booked passage
from Lisbon to 'Rio de Janeiro as Count and
Countess Sedlak. A couple of witnesses from
New York said they were on the saine boat
and were introduced to the self-styled Count
and Countess Sedlak. All I am interested in is
having honourable members-most if not all
of whom are more capable of passing judgment on such a question than I am-say
whether we want to go into this kind of thing
or not. I shall be satisfied with your decision.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable memabers, as chairman of the committee, I would
point out that we act as judges in disposing
of the petitions which come before us. In this

instance I think the honourable gentleman's
contention that if this divorce were granted
the Divorce Committee would degenerate into
a Reno divorce mill cannot be sustained.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The petitioner is at
present a bona fide resident of Canada and is
in process of securing naturalization. I do not
suppose she could go back to Czechoslovakia,
and I doubt whether she would be admitted
into the United States. In a word, she is a
refugee. The committee thought it was only
fair to treat lier petition on its merits.
An Hon. SENATOR: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: As the honourable
senator froin Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
is aware, the evidence in support is convincing.
So far as I am concerned, I shall support the
committee's recommendation.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Is it 'contended that
divorces should be refused on the ground that
the petitioner is not a British subject? I
think we ought to establish a principle. If
you desire to refuse the divorce on the ground
that there has been collusion and so forth,
all right, decide the case on its merits. But
I should not like to refuse the petitioner relief
in view of the fact that she must wait for five
years before becoming a British subject,
though she may have very good grounds for
a divorce.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:
to Reno?

Why can she not go

Hon. Mr. EULER: She is a resident of
Canada. It is not a question of our Divorce
Committee becoming a Reno divorce mill.
There is only one ground for divorce in
Canada; in Reno the grounds are legion.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: If you are a Canadian citizen you may apply to any court in
Canada for a divorce. In this case the evidence
was very clear, and showed that the husband
and another woman sailed froin Lisbon to Rio
de Janeiro as man and wife, and that they were
introduced to their fellow passengers as man
and wife, and it was only after they landed
at Rio that someone who had known him
and his wife in Europe recognized that his
companion was not Mrs. Sedlak. The news
eventually reached New York, and the petitioner then proceeded to take the necessary
steps for divorce. She was granted temporary
entry to Canada in September, 1939, and by
Order in Council of January, 1940, she was
granted legal status as a resident. She is now
in process of acquiring domicile. Her brother,
if I remember the evidence, is running a mushroom farm near Toronto.

124

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is no Reno element
in this case at all. If you heard evidence
given before our committee by private
detective after private detective, you might
think of Reno. Detective evidence invariably
is along these lines: the respondent was found
in the same room with another man or woman,
as the case may be, and they were drinking
liquor together. In this case there was no
such evidence. The husband was shown to
have taken passage on a boat with another
woman, and on the voyage they posed as
man and wife, and everybody on board thought
they were man and wife. Only later was it
discovered that they were not.
As to the question of money, which is
raised by my honourable friend, I may say
that we recently granted a divorce to a woman
who was earning only $3 a week. She received this amount per week plus her board,
and had to rent a room outside. So the
question of money does not influence the
committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend does not get my point.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Oh, yes, I do.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I say that it cost
hundreds of dollars to bring these people
here from New York and to hire lawyers
to press this case.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The woman I now refer
to had a very good lawyer to present her
case; in fact, he was a K.C. We remitted
part of the fee in her case, as has been
donc in many other cases. What we try to
do in the committee is what people of common sense would do if they had to deal with
the matter. We may be terribly wrong, but
we think that if a husband or his wife, of
twenty-five or thirty years of age, or even
up to forty, is running around with someone
else, and husband and wife cannot live
together, they should not be tied to each
other.
In the case under consideration the woman
was young. The money did not get her the
divorce; it got her into Canada. She could
have gone to Reno and got a divorce there
for less money.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Did the honourable gentleman sit on the Divorce Committee
when this case was being heard?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I read the evidence over
twice, and I heard the discussion raised by
the honourable gentleman. I went back again
and read the evidence in detail, and heard
the honourable gentleman's argument as to
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

why he was going to oppose the divorce.
The honourable gentleman said that if this
woman had not had money we would not
have granted the divorce, and he talked about
it being wrong to grant it. There is nothing
wrong about it. If ever a person was entitled
to a divorce it was the woman in this case.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, I happen to be a member of the Divorce
Committee, and I was present when the
evidence in this case was taken. To my mind,
it was one of the clearest cases that ever
came before our committee, and I am quite
satisfied on the evidence that the divorce
should be granted and a Bill passed accordingly.
The law on the subject is, to my mind,
quite clear. A person does not require to
be a British subject before ho or she can
make application for divorce by way of a
private bill. I have in my hand volume 69
of the Ontario Reports for 1933, where, in
the case of Upper v Upper, the law as to
the - granting of divorce by Parliament is
stated in these terms:
Parliament is not a forum adjudicating upon
the rights of litigants. It is a legisiative body,
and can grant or refuse relief sought, not on
the basis of right, but upon the grounds of
expediency. Each divorce granted is not a
(ecree based upon pre-existing rights, but a
distinct legislative enactment.
I think that sets out the position quite clearly.
Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable members,
J do not very often burden this House with
my views, but as a member of the Divorce
Committee, and one who heard the evidence,
and joined in the unanimous recommendation
that a bill be proposed to the Senate, I feel
that I should take exception, first of all, to
the manner in which this report bas been
treated since it first entered the House. I do
not think it is fair to any petitioner to move
from day to day that an order stand over,
and then, as was done to-day, to propose
putting it over again until such time as the
House is taking a recess. Regardless of whether
a petitioner is a citizen of Canada or a British
subject, I believe that Canadian residence or
interests in Canada give him the right to
petition this Parliament, which, after all, is
the right te petition the King.
The people concerned in this case have no
country; they are refugees. From my observation T would say that if we eould secure
as applicants for Canadian citizenship not
only the petitioner, but also her brother and
the witness who appeared, it would be a very
good thing for this country. I do not think
we should let it be felt that we are not ready
to treat refugees from other countries fairly,

APRIL 2, 1941
and 1 believe that any other action than
the one we have taken wouid resuit in sucb
a feeling.
Just a few days ago a petition for a bill
was sponsored by the honourable senator from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) on behalf
of an American concern asking for a-change
in its incorporation. We should be quite as
mucb justified in refusing that company the
right to apply to this Parliament as in denying that right to the people in question.
I arn sorry that I have -to differ with the
bonourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock), for whom I have a very highi
personal regard. Further, 1 arn sorry that hie
bas seen fit to spread across the pages of
the newspapers of Canada the expressions hoe
has used in asking if we are going to turn the
Senate into another "Reno divorce mili."
1 believe that this report shouid be received
and the Bill passed, in order to be sent to
the other House for consideration.
The motion for second reading was agreed
to, and the Bill was read the second time.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a third tirne?
Hon. Mr. ROBINS ON: With the leave of

COWAN DIVORCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON movod the second
reading of Bill M, an Act for the relief of
Gordon Alexander Cowan.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourabie
senators, at the risk of being further dislîked,
I feel compeliod to draw attention to this
partidular case. Eight years ago, on the llth
of May, this Senate turnod down an application for the relief of this man Cowan. In that
case 144 pages of ovidonce were taken, and it

is only fair to say that of the six members of
the Divorce Committee who heard the evidence four were in favour of granting the
petition and two were opposed.
The report of the committee came to this
Hanse, and finally a bill was presentod. Three
distinguished senators-two nf them have since
leSt us and gone to their long last reward,
and the other was my gnod friend the honourable senator from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
-were opposed to giving this man Cowan the
relief whieh hie requested, and to which I
think hoe was entitled. Maybo I have not
been brnught up right; maybe I arn ton
tnucby; but it seems to me that it was a case
nf "R1e that bath, to him shahl be given; and
he that bath not, from him shahl bo taken
even that whîch he bath."
Let us listen to the argument advanced by
my gond friend from Aima on May il, 1932.
Ho said:
Coming frorn the city of Montreal, I happen
to know the faýther of tbe lady who is the
defendant in this case, and I cao say that
bie and bis farnily are among the very highest
and most respectable people of that city...
I sincerely trust, honourable gentlemen, for

question, and for the sake ofilber farnily, wbicb,
as I have ýalready stated, is very well known
and holds a high position in Montreal, that
this petition for relief wilI iot bie granted.
The father nf the lady in question was the
managing director nf Birks' Jewellery Store in
Montreal. Wbat wvas the result? H1e, having
wealtb enough, was able to keep the husband
ni the lady from gctting a divorce to whicb I

tbought the evidence insufficient.
In any
event, the distinguished gentleman referred
to by my hononrable friend frorn Aima bad
enougb money to send bis daughter to Reno,
where she got a divorce-presumably for
desertion-after which she came back tb«
Montreal. On September 1, 1939, she went
to Portl-and, Maine, and rnarried another
man and 00W she is living in affluence and

The poor busband, who for eight years could

for the divorce.
The only reason I arn
mentioning it is that it wonld appear unfair
that the applicant should have bad to wait;
and again I say that il the father of the lady
had been a brakeman or switchman, the
applicant wonld not have been prevented frnm
getting bis divorce eigbt years ago.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: This is a new
raie in wbicb I find myself. Tbe honourable
senator frorn Parkdaie (Hon. Mr. Mnrdock)
bas not emphasized the fact that wben this

Iady's husband applied bere for a divorce the

SENATE

evidence, in the opinion of two other senators
and myself, was not sufficient to justify the
granting of such a divorce. I do not know
the lady and have never met her, but I still
maintain sie comes from a very fine family.
If she has gone to Reno and got a divorce,
which she thinks is valid in this country, but
which in fact is not, I do not see how we can
have very much against her for that. As to
the former petition presented by the husband,
the whole question is whether the evidence
heard was such as to justify giving the man a
divorce. As I have already said, I did not
think it was. nor did two other senators.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Four members of
the Divorce Committee did.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
TIIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON moved the third
reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
BUCKLEY DIVORCE BILL
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON moved the second
reading of Bill 0, an Act for the relief of
Ann Elsie Buckley.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, you will have noticed, I am sure, that
for several days past there has been on the
Order Paper, in my name, an inquiry in
connection with the respondent in this case.
I would respectfully ask that this motion be
allowed to stand until my inquiry is answered.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it is moved by Hon. Mr. Robinson,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Sinclair, that this Bill
be now read a second time. Is it your pleasure
to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr MURDOCK: It surely would be
rough-house tactics to insist that a motion be
passed before an honourable member's inquiry
relative to it has been answered. I honestly
believe the answer to my inquiry will prove
It is not
that this case is a " frame-up."
many months since in this very city of
Ottawa a man was sent to the penitentiary
for several years for framing evidence in
con.nection with divorce cases. In my humble
judgment, the same kind of thing may be
involved right here. The questions I asked
were designed to show whether it is or not
A lot more can be said if honourable members
,nsist that second reading be given to this
Bill before my inquiry is answered.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Personally I should
have no objection to waiting until the inquiry
is answered.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Did the committee
have before it the information on which the
fhonourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) bases his belief that the evidence
is a "frame-up"?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No. But afterwards
I started to analyse the evidence carefully
particularly with reference to certain incidents
that were alleged to have occurred over in
the city of Hull, always on a Friday night.
Who gave the evidence about these alleged
incidents?
Jack Levey, a Jewish friend, a
bailiff and process server of Ottawa, and his
son, who is now, but was not a-t that time,
a member of the Air Force. In my humble
judgment-of course, I have often been mistaken-somebody was "planted" over in Hull
to bring about the result secured when these
two amateur detectives went around.
I received to-day lrom the Minister of
National Defence a letter which reads as
follows:
Dear Senator Murdock,
Regarding your question No. 1 of March 26:
Please note that leave books are, generally
speaking, not kept for officers in camps. Leave
is usually given by the Battery Commander
verbally.
At some inconvenience and research we have
had the mess books looked up for each of the
days you mention, and the officer to whom you
refer was in camp on those days.
Naturally the Battery Commander cannot
cast his mind back for six months or a year
to remember whether on a particular date he
gave leave verbailly; and it is quite possible
that the officer would be out of camp after duty
hours until reveille the next morning.
If there is any real purpose to be served
by our chasing this down further and interrogating the officers concerned, I shall sec what
cau be done. Are you trying to "puncture an
alibi" set up by this gentleman, or what is
the object of these meticulous enquiries?
Yours very truly,
J. L. Ralston.
I firmly and honestly believe the records
will show that this respondent, Buckley, was
at Petawawa camp, a hundred and some odd
miles from Ottawa, on the three Friday nights
on which our two friends, the process server
and his son, said he was in Hull. Note again
that the alleged incidents occurred always on
a Friday, not a Saturday. Why? Well, to some
people, Saturday is the Sabbath. Personally
I am opposed to acting on allegations that
may be contrary to fact-that may be of the
same kind as those which, as I have said,
resulted in the conviction of a man here in
Ottawa not long ago and his being sent to

APRIL 2, 1941
Kingston Peniten-tiary. 1 plead with honourable members to let this motion stand until
my inquiry is answered.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: In view of what
has been stated by the heonourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), I feel it might
be well to let the motion stand as bie suggests, until his inquiry is answered.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn very
glad the Chairman of the Divorce Committee
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) ham taken that view.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Thank you.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I take it
that the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hlon. Mr. Murdýock) is a member of the
Divorce Cominittee and accepted the evîdence
which was given in this case, as perliaps
anyone would, but that hie has since had
reason to believe the evidence wa.s not. truc,
and in order to settie his doubts hie asks that
the Bill be not proceeded with further until
hie receives answers to this series of questions
wbich hie bas placed on the Order Paper. I
do not tbink that is unreasonable.
Hon. Mr. KING: Could the matter not be
referred back, to the committee?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Yes. There
is no need of having the questions answered
in this House.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Did this man Buckley
appear before the committee to defend himself?
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: No. lie bas been
overseas since last November, I believe. Perhaps one of the things that made me suspiejous was the information that before-ho left
ho exprcssed to a fellow officer his belief that
a divorce was going to be arrang-ed for him
while hie was away. Anyway, let us get the
facts asked for in my inquiry.
lion. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, 1
suggest that the mattor be referred to the
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable senators, if
the rnattcr wore referred to the committeo a
lot of unnecessary and unsavoury publicity in
the Press would be avoided. 1 would suggo.st
that, ponding recoipt of answers to the honourablo senator's inquiry, the Bill be roforred
to the cornmitteo.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I think that is
perhaps the better thing to bo done. PorsonalIy, I had no suspicions at ail about this
case. The evidence was very clear.
Hon. Mr. KING: Hear, hear.

127

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I should flot; like
to effond the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) by creating the
impression that we were trying to push the
Bill along too rapidly. I would move that
the Bill be referred to the committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: There are two
motions hefore the Chair now.
lion. Mr. ROBINSON: With leave, I would
move that my motion for second reading of
Bill 0 he withdrawiû, and that the Bill ho
roferred to the *Standing Committeo on
Divorce.
The motion for second readîng was withdrawn, and the Bill was referred to the
Standing Cornmittee on Divorce.
ROBERTS DIVORCE BILL
SECOND READlNO
Hon, C. W. ROBINSON moved the second
reading of Bill Q, an Act for the relief of
Hubert Earl Roberts.
1Ho said: Honourable senators, I believe
there is seme desire to discuss this Bili also.
It arises out of the only divorce petition
that bas been received from Prince Edward
Island in a considerable time. As Chairmanl
i ci Divorcc Comlmittee, I have no option
but te move for second reading.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, of ail the members of this House I
arn possibly the rnost unfitted to present the
,plea whicb I arn going to put forth now. I arn
heartily in favour of this divorce, as I think
ail honourable senaters ivili be when they
*hear a few words wbich it seems to me ought
to ho said. This is the first case that bas
come te us from Prince Edward Island in
three years. Briefly, the facts are these. In
1926, a young man, twenty-five years old,
married a girl of sixteen, and by 1934 they
had bad five children, aIl boys. Thon the
woman discontinued living with hier husband
and went to live witb bis younger brother,
next door, and since .1934 three eildron
bave heen born te the woman and this younger
brother. Wben this case came hefore the
Divorce Committee we had frem the respondent, mother of eight cbildren, five by bier
husband and three by another man, a request
that she ho provided with funds to enable bier
to appear and defend berself. Under our rules
ber request had to ho granted, and $75 was
sent te lier. I might say that this was pureiy
and simply a hold-up. Undoubtedly she had
ne intention of appearing.
Now, I cannet believe that the authorities
of Prinre Edward Island want their province
te be given that kind of notorioty hofore [he

SENATE
Senate Divorce Committee at Ottawa, and I
mention the case now in the hope that a
couple of our Prince Edward Island senators
to whom I have spoken will bring this matter
to the attention of the provincial authorities
and ask them whether, for the good nane of
that beautiful province down by the sea, they
will not kindly handle cases of this kind at
home.
I am sustained in my hope by what happened before our committee two or three days
ago, when the only witness for a woman
petitioner was a Roman Catholic priest.
Surely we ought te feel encouraged that, as it
seems to me, there lias been a loosening up of
somne of the objections that heretofore have
been made to divorces. Only a single witness
was necessary to enable the Divorce Conmiittee to grant the petition. I cite that in
connection with this case because I think
maybe the question of religion has had sometliing to do with Prince Edward Island, as well
as Quebec, holding aloof from these cases and
sending them along to the Senate to be dealt
with. Honourable senators, I have only the
kindîîliest feeling for those who, I think, should
handle their own problems at home.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members, the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) has just stated that the
only witness in support of a petition heard
by the Senate Divorce Committee was a
Roman Catholie priest. I am afraid that a
wrong interpretation may be placed upon that
bald statement. The facts are that a certain
couple came to the priest to get a childbaptized, and in order to make his entries
he inquired who were the parents. Later he
was suninioned as a witness and gave evidence
based on the information which lue had reccived in his capacity as parish priest-evidence which in no way reflected on him or
on his churcl.
Hion. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend is quite correct. I regret I did not go
into details. The facts had been misrepresented to the priest, and he baptized as legitimate a child whom later he found to be
illegitimate.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

On the notice by Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:

Canadian Government to the British Government in respect of refusal, reluctance or delay

of British firms to supply necessary plans,
specifications or other essential data to Canadian firms, - to be used in the production of
war equipment or munitions of any kind.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: All I desire
to say is that my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). as a member of
the Privy Council and of the Imperial Privy
Council, knows full well that without our
conferring first with the Imperial Government
no answer can be given as to representations
th't passed between the two Governments.
It is for him to say whether, in view of this,
he will move his motion in order to get the
answer I can give him now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will move
the motion. But will the honourable leader
of the House listen to the inquiry? It reads:
Whethér representations of any kind were
made, prior to the evacuation of Dunkirk, by
the Canadian Government to the British Government in respect of refusal, reluctance or
delay of British firms to supply necessary plans,
specifications or other essential data to Canadian firms, to be used in the production of war
equipment or munitions of any kind.
I merely ask whether any representations have
passed from the Government of Canada to
the Government of Britain. Am I to be told
that the Government of Canada is not free to
answer that question?
Is the right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman moving his motion
now?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; I am
repeating my question. I refuse to accept as
an answer anything in the way of a statement
that communication with the British Government is required in order to enable the
ùovernment of Canada to answer that inquiry.
I am dealing with the inquiry first.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: There are on
the Order Paper two things which appear to

"Inquiries" and asks the Government a
question, while the other appears in the form
of a motion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We are not at
that yet.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am under the
impression that No. 2 could be answered as if
it were a question. Of course, the Government can always delay its answer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer I
have made covers the first and as well the
second Order, which is my right honourable
friend's motion. I have been informed that
no correspondence that passed between the
two Governments can be produced by one of
them without the other's approval.

129

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable leader says that the documents cannot be
produced by one Government without the
consent of the other. That I know; but it is
not a reply to my question. I am not asking
for production at all; I am merely asking
whether the communications passed.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Your question involves
the contents.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, only the
subject-matter. I do not think the leader of
the House needs any rescue by the honourable
senator from Vancouver South.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am sure he does not.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is merely a
question whether anything passed on this
subject; nothing more.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have nothing
to add to what I have stated concerning the
inquiry. I am awaiting my right honourable
friend's action on the motion.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: If I
cannot get yes or no to my inquiry-if, on
behalf of the Government, the honourable
leader of the House simply refuses to answer
that plain question-I press my.motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then, I suppose,
I can discuss the motion. My right honourable friend knows how this whole discussion
arose. It arose out of his statement appearing
at page 87 of the Senate Hansard.

Will the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
leader of the Government undertake to ask
the British Government whether it will
approve of the production of the correspondence, if there is any?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
to my right honourable friend that he move
the motion. I shall have no objection to
letting it pass, so that he may have the
official answer from the Department of External Affairs.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I will tell
my right honourable friend what the Government of Canada did in the matter of helping
the manufacturers of Canada in getting orders
from the British people.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member can make a speech on that any
time he likes, but it is net the subject of the
motion. This motion is for a return showing
just what the Government of Canada did in
respect of the British Government's cormplacency, of which he complains.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I shall
proceed to give an answer on that question.
On the 1lth of June, 1940, the Right Honourable Mr. Mackenzie King spoke in the House
of Commons on industry and the war, and

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I would
draw the attention of my right honourable
friend to this situation. The subject which is
before us arose out of a statement by him
which appears at page 87 of Hansard:
We were complacent for months; we are
not half so complacent to-day.
To which I answered:
And not half so complacent -as Grea.t Britain
was herself.
It is in order to substantiate his assertion, of
which my statement was a consequence, that
he has continued the discussion. I am ready
to go into the matter of the complacency of
the Canadian Government during the first
months, for my right honourable friend alleges
it was in those first months, or the first year,
that we were too complacent; but if I enter
into a discussion of the matter for the purpose
of settling the point at issue, it will be on
my right honourable friend's responsibility
that I do so.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Right Honourable Mr. Mackenzie King is Minister of
External Affairs and is responsible for the
administration of this country, and my right
honourable friend is not.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the honourable gentleman is not satisfied with the
speech he made last week he can make
another, so far as I am concerned, but that
is not on the subject of the motion which is
now before the House. The motion is for
the production of papers to show what, if
anything, the Government of Canada did in
-aspect of that complacency on the part of
the British Government of which he complains.
That, and nothing else, is the subject of my
motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

They are better

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Here is what he
said:
A day or two ago my honourable friend the
Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Hanson) spoke
of the conference which a few days before
had taken place between representatives of
the Manufacturers' Association and the Government. I intimated te him at the time that the
Government and the manufacturers had .agreed
that the best method of proceeding in the
matter in which they were mutually concerned
was to have a message sent to our High Commissioner in London which would set forth
the views both of the manufacturers and of the
Government with regard to Canada's capacity
for producing munitions and other essential war
materials, and the desire of both to have this
capacity made use of to the greatest possible
extent. I should like to read to the House, in
order that it may be of record on Hansard, the
communication which bas since been sent by
the Government to our High Commissioner. It,
better than anything else, will make perfectly
clear the position of both parties with respect
to the matter referred to. The communication
was sent by myself on June 8 and was as
follows:

"On Thursday, June the 6th, our Government
received a large delegation from the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association to discuss the situation with respect to the manufacture in Canada
of munitions and supplies for the United Kingdom and allied governments.

APRIL 3, 1941
"The delegation expressed great concern that
Canadian manufacturing capacity continued to
be used to sueh a small degree in the supply
of essential war materials for the Allied Governments, despite the willingness of Canadian
manufacturers to utilize to the full the resources
of their plants for this purpose.
"As you know, the Government, both prior to
and since the outbreak of war, have on many
occasions both directly and through yourself,
drawn the attention of the United Kingdom
Government to the -availability of Canadien
industrial resources, and recently in a telegram
to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
I drew Mr. Churchill's personal attention to
Canadian resources in this respect.
"At qny suggestion that they prepare a memorandum as to what points they felt should be
emphasized in representations to the United
Kingdom Government, the delegation from the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association have sent
me on June 6 the following communication."
The communication is then quoted in full as
follows:
Dear Mr. King:
On behalf of the members of the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association, I beg to thank you
and your colleagues for receiving their delegation to-day.
We realize fully the burdens which members
of the Cabinet are bearing and the many
demands on their time and only the vital importance of war production would have caused
us to seek an interview with you et this critical
time. We are very grateful to you and your
colleagues for the patient hearing which was
given to us and also for the extremely interesting and valuable information that we received.
You were kind enough to offer to cable immediately to the Hon. Vincent Massey, High
Commissioner for Canada in the United Kingdom, to ask him to take up with the British
Government the matters we discussed with you.
You suggested that we prepare some notes which
might be of some assistance in tha drafting of
your cable and we are glad to take advantage
of the opportunity which you have kindly given
us, and beg to set forth the following suggestions.
The suggestions are in quotations as follows:
"At the annual meeting of the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association in Winnipeg, May
29, 30 and 31, manufacturers from all parts
of Canada expressed themselves very strongly
in favour of mobilizing immediately the intelligence, skill, equipment and capacity of Canadian
They offered every possible cooperation to the Canadian, British and French
Governments in this terrible emergency. They
expressed surprise and disappointment that,
following the visit of their mission to England
lest summer and the presentation of Canadian
industriel capacity, which was so well received
in England, and the prompt appointment of a
British mission to Canada, Canadien industry
is being used so little up to date.
"Today, a representative group of leading
Canadian manufacturers met the Prime Minister
and eleven other members of the Cabinet in
Ottawa and had a very helpful conference.
"Will you kindly discuss with the British
Government the following pointe which were
made by 'the representatives of the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association to-day:
"1. Canadian manufacturers made war suppl-ies to the value of $1.200,000,000 for the
Imperial Munitions Board during the lest war.

rindustry.

14879-9

131

This fact proves the capacity of Canadian
industry. Canadian industrial expansion since
then bas made possible vastly increased menufacturing facilities, and a wider range of
products, involving greatly improved technique.
Full particulars were presented to the service
departments of the British Government by the
Association's mission to England last summer.
This is in your possession.
"2. Canadien industry again extends every
possible co-operation to the British, French and
Canadian Governments.
"3. There is available in Canada a great
amount of industrial capacity, especially in the
engineering, machinery and metal working
trades with highly skilled technical staffs. Over
a year ago, a survey of one hundred plants
showed that these had available 3,000,000 square
feet of floor space. Very liittle of this is in
use now.
"4. There is a great deal of machinery, equipment and tools used in peace time manufacturing, that can be adapted quickly to war
manufacturing with good results in a general
mohilization of industrial resources.
"5. The time for placing small experimental
orders is past. The British and French Governments should advise immediately what they
want in large quantities, and give Canadien
manufacturers an opportunity to learn what is
expeoted of them. On receipt of this information Canadian manufacturers will make their
plans accordingly so as to use their plants to
the best advantage."
That is the end of the suggestions which
appear in quotations. The letter continues:
Permit me to assure you that the members of
the delegation who met you to-day keenly appreciate your kind offer to cable Mr. masse
asking him to take up our suggestions with
the British Government.
Thanking you on their behalf, I remain,
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) Harold Crabtree,
President,
Canadian Manufacturers' Association.
Then the Prime Minister's telegram to Mr.
Massey continues as follows:
The Government continue to be of the opinion
that Canadian planta might be utilized te a
far greater extent as a source of supply for the
Allied Governments, relatively f-ree from the
danger of hostile action, and you are accordingly directed to bring this matter once more
to the -attention of the appropriate authorities
in the United Kingdom, setting out -in particular
the representations of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association as quoted -in paragraph
five of this telegram. I shall be obliged if in
so doing you will inform the Government of
the United Kingdoin and the heads of the
departments concerned that our Government
concur in the views expressed by the Association
,and repeat the assurance of our willingness
and readiness to do everything possible to assist
in the development of increased production in
this country to meet essential war needs.
That is the statement made on June 11,
1940, by the Prime Minister, whose responsibility it is, among other things, to communi-

cate with the British Government. That
statement shows the representations made
by the Canadien Manufacturers' Association

I slxould like te recel cxv some stafements
made in the flouse of Lords. On July il,
1940, Lord ]darnby spoke as follows, as reported
at colcîmus 934 and 935 of the Officiai Report
of the flouse of Lords Debates:
The productive capacity of Caîxadian inducfry
is apprecicbly greater than the relative proportion of tîxaf populatioîn.
There is a tencleney

to regard ten millions of population in Canada

Surely prudence

APRIL 3,1941
requires envisaging Canada as the second line
of industrial and naval defence. Why not aim
at the development of plants there and negotiate
for expansion to include transfer from the
United Kingdom of selected plants or parts
of plants, with necessary technical perqonnel?
In brief, give evidence of commencement of' a
planned drift from industrial concentration in
this island to expansion in the Empire in
North America.
Honourable members will have noticed complaints of blue-prints and other things not
reaching manufacturers in Canada. These
complaints I mentioned, and they are covered
by my right honourable friend's inquiry. I
find that on July 31, 1940, Lord Barnby in
the House of Lords made this statement, as
printed at column 47 of the Official Report:
I cannot pass over the question of Canada's
war effort, becausa I have heard on many
sides criticisin of that war effort. There is
no point in recrimination or in reviewing the
past, except, as the Prime Minister said, with
the object of fortifying us in our determination
for the future. Comparisons are odious in so
far as tbey are made with other parts of the
Empire, but it is certain that had the United
Kingdom followed the policy of making a
greater call, at an earlier date, on Canada's
productive capacity. it would have been
answered and it would have inspired the Canadian people and impelled the Canadian Government to make efforts on their own part much
greater than they did, instead of being lulled
into an appearance of inaction by the meagre
demande which this country made upon them.
At the present moment the presence here of
Mr. Charles Banks, representing the Canadian

Munitions Board, ensures that these problems
will be properly eurveyecd. and I know that
with Mr. J. P. Bickell here assisting Lord
Beaverbrook, these factors will be continually
put forward. I expeet that the infusing of the
vigorous methode practised in Canada into our
governmental machine will produce some electrifying effects even on the Civil Service, to
w.hich Lord Strabolgi addressed, and rightly
addressed, a considerable homily recently in
your Lordships' House.
Sir Thomas
Lord Caldecote-formerly
Inskip--Secretary of State for the Dominions,
answerèd that statement by Lord Barnby in
these words:
A fortnight ago my noble friend Lord
Woolton made statements which I think I
am right in saying reassured opinion in all
parts of your Lordships' House. He dealt
with a number of detail questions such as the
supply organization in North America, the
responsibility of our representatives for settling
prices, the stability of design and other detailed
matters, but more particularly and most important of all was what he said in relation
to the volume of orders which are now being
placed in America.
The answer which be was able to give was
that orders are now being placed to full capacity
in the United States of America and Canada;
and I repeat that the very fullest use is
now being made of every possible capacity that
there is in Canada, whether it is exieting
capacity or capacity tha.t must be created, that
can come in.to production before January, 1942.

He adds at column 54:
I fully appreciate. if my noble friend will
allow me to say so, the spirit of what he bas
said as to the development and the use of
Canadian resources, but I really think that
the action that has been taken by my noble
friend Lord Beaverbrook and the Minister of
Supply, has reassured public opinion. The
orders that have been placed in the month of
July alone in Canada represent a very largç
increase, running into millions of pounds, over
the whole of the orders placed for the preceding six months in Canada. That itself is
indicative of the development of those resources.
Lord Strabolgi, formerly of the Admiralty
War Staff in London and Assistant Chief
of Staff at Gibraltar, published, at the end
of 1940, a book entitled "The Campaign in
the Low Countries."
In the first chapter
the author analyses some of the causes of
what he describes as "stupendous events of
May, 1940." Among these causes were the
following, as set out on pages 16 and 17:
In the lean years after the Great War,
when all nations were trying to strengthen
their financial positions and when money for
armaments was hard to come by, a certain
number of aircraft manufacturing firms propounded the ides that in order that they
themselves should be kept in being and ready
to expand in times of peril, all the orders from
the Government for aeroplanes should be given
to them. They came to be called "The Ring."
Their argument was that if entrepreneurs
entered the aircraft manufacturing field, the
limited contracts available would be too widely
spread and some of the older established aireraft
manufacturing firms might have to go out of
business. We need not question their patriotie
motives. Unfortunately this custom of only
permitting the existence of a limited number
of aircraft manufacturing firms became a habit.
Right up te the outbreak of the present war,
and for months afterwards, one very important
manufacturing concern with a good reputation
in the North of England, but outside the
charmed aircle, was left with its magnificent
plant and highly skilled workers half idle. By
May, 1940, when the terrible twenty days of
the campaign in the Low Countries began, the
position was that we were still in the stage
of building armament factories. In some cases
this was being done in -a leisurely manner.
I know of two very large armament factories
which it was decided were vitally necessary
in February of 1940. The order to begin
building them was only given in this same
fateful month of May.
At pages 17 and 18 he says:
A totalitarian system was adjusted to totalitarian war. Immense stocks of raw materials
of all kinds and of petroleum and petroleum
products were accumulated.
Some endeavour
was made in Britain to follow suit. Whale oil,
wheat and sugar, for example, were bought and
stored, petrolcum reserves were created; but
some of the most important metals vitally
necessary for the survival of Britain were not
stored owing to Treasury obstruction. When
the new men in the new Government under Mr.
Churchill set to work they found a number of
annoying bottlenecks hampering our production
caused by the lack of these vitally important
metals and raw materials. It was found,

134

SENATE

furthermore, tliat in several of these cases the
Treasury, always supported by its First Lord,
Mr. Neville Chamberlain, had refused or delayed
sanction to buy in advance of actual war.
At page 26 hie continues:
During the years when the Nazi dagrto
our peace and security loomed even dakr ne
real attempt was made to harness the whole
of the great rnanufacturing and engineering
resources of the country for the purpose of
strengthening our defences. By May, 1940, as
already described, we were stili in the stage
of building munition factories.
At page 27 1 find the following:
Even tbe actisal outhreak of war did net lead
to an appreciable quickening of the effort...
and six moasths after the war had ýbeen raging
we stili had nearly *a million men unemployed.
0f these probably 500,000
were available
and unused.
And at page 28 there is this statement:
To understand one of the main reasons for
this, it is necessary te remember the curions
economie system avhich had been allowed to
grow up in the post-war years and especially
since the econemic depression which afflicted
the world between the years 1928-32. It was
seught te create an artificial1 prosperity by
delibcrately limiting output.
In corne cases
thîs axas donc by the banks. Tbeir financial
power was used te ruii and drive out of
business the weakcr artificial silk rnanufacturers, for instance.
The Bank of Eng'land
fathered a corporation for forcibly buying up
a large number cf important sbipyards and
closing them dowe permanently. It was called
sterilîzation. and was donc se that the remaining shipyards ceuld presper owing te the dutting
away of ucmpetition. The result was th,ît siibuilding plant and, still averse, skilled shipyard
workers, which w-ould bo needed if w-ar came.
were put perrnanently eut of commission. ceaI
i1nes were olosed doavn ie the ganie way. The
establishment cf new and up-te date steel works
was discouraged.
Fin ally 1 quote from page 29:
Wheni war leomed on the hoerizon and it w-as
desired te expand and incroase preduction fer
tîce purpose of rearmarnent, and the vitally
important expoi-t trade, thiere was great difficulty in reversing tihe precess.
As my righit honourable friend is deubtîcess
aware, the book is published by Hutchinsen
& Co., cf London and Melburne.
I think I bave established that if Canada
could be accused of complacency during the
first mentbs of the war, that complacency
could be traced te the British authorities, and
bad considerablo cffect in forcing Canada te

I stated a moment ago that this matter
came te us because my right henourable
friend, roalizing hie could net assail the
Govei-nment on to-day's or to-morroav's programme, decided to revert to conditions provailing during the flrst months of the war. I
thought lie would forget the past and look

harped again on the flrst months cf the war.
I want te know if we are very much interested
in what teck place during the first menths of
the war, ncw that wo are facing difficulties
innumerable, which ave cannot face by Jeeking
backwards. My right henourablo friend lias
looked backwards. The Govornment ef the
day is lcekicg at the difficulties cf the presont
and tise problems cf tc-merrow.
At the
institution cf this Chamber, Sir John A.
Macdonald declared that it siseuld regard the
Government cf the day witls sympathy, because
it was an emacation cf the will cf the people.
Isuggest that members cf the Senate sheuld
show sympathy tcwards the Goverament and
help it rather than give utterance te destructive speeches that wiil affect the morale cf
the country. I am scrry that at times my
right honourabie friend speaks in the Sonate
as thcugh hoe were a reprosentative cf the
people and were speaking for them. in the
Huse cf Cemmens. As I tcld him seme
time ago, I have heard speeches cf bis which

say in faveur cf that Gcvernment, however,
what bas cften been ropeated-that thougli
the British may muddle through, they always

with admiration, the right honourable gentleman continues ta criticize the Gavernment.
I hope he will realîze that henceforth we must
ail look forward, and flot back.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Han. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: It is sa
long since the leader of the House started hie
speech that he may have forgotten the motion
on the Order Paper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Na, 1 have nat
f orgotten it. 1 have stated that I have no
abjection ta its being passed if my right honourable friend sa desires. But I think he
would be wise if he withdrew it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will take
the chance that the leader of the bouse will
not need ta make another speech before I
am through.
In ail quietness let us read what is an the
Order Paper. It is a motion that an Order
of the Senate do issue for a copy of any representatians made by this Government ta, the
British Government in respect of what the
leader of the House bas alleged was failure,
if not action in the nature of traitarous conduct, on the part of the British Government.
1 simply cail the attention of the House ta
this: the motion does nat e'ven ask for the
British Gavernment's reply; al1it asks for
is a copy of anything sent by this Government ta the British Government. Yesterday the question asking whether anything went
appeared on the Order Paper, and staod over.
Now let the House decide. Here is a Government which says: "There was failure, very
bad failure, in Britain. You people here in
the Parliament of Canada should nat discuss
aur failure of several months aga, because
that is looking back, but we of the Government af Canada ought ta discuss the failure
of the British Government of several months
aga. That is looking forward." The leader
of the Government declared the British had
been dereliet; that they had not been doing
their duty at ail; that, selfishly, they had
refused blue-prints and plans ta Canadian
manufacturers. Were that the case, a duty
immediately devolved upon the Government
of Canada. 1 arn asking what that Qovernment did.
bon. Mr. DANDURAND: You have Mr.
King's letter.
Right bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. Ail the
speeches he makes have nathing ta do with
what I amn asking. I amn asking what aur
Government did ta bring ta the attention of
the British Government the charge made of
dereliction on the part af British industry.
If aur Government did nothing, then the

indictment lies, and lies for ever, at its door.
If it did something, why can it flot tell us
what it did? Has the bouse no suspicion as
ta why it cannot tell us? I have a deepseated suspicion as ta, that, and I am going
ta state it. I believe the reasan is that aur
Gavernment neyer wrote a letter, neyer had
a communication, neyer did anything; and,
what is mare, I believe it neyer had any
realization that there was need of doing anything. What it says is said ta caver up its
own negleet, and its inability ta realize what
were the needs.
ThaJ, again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
relates ta the first xnonths of the war.
If I arn
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
wrong, let the Government prove me wrong.
I arn of the belief that it neyer moved a
finger-that neyer a communication went ta
England.
There is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
letter written ta Mr. Massey.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is flot
complaining ta the British Government; that
is telling what we could do. It is not a
letter camplaining ta the British Government that British manufacturers are nat playing the game with us, nor is it one askingthat Govermnent ta take these people by the
neck and make them play the game. Such
a letter should have been sent if what the
leader of the Governmnent says occurred is
correct; but there is no communication of
that kind at all.
I arn not going ta try ta campete with the
leader of the Government by giving little
lectures on the speeches he makes. Suffice it
ta say that his heaviest allegation is that my
speeches sound like those of the leader of the
Opposition in the other House-and I amn not
sure I shauld be asharned of that. But I may
tell my honaurable friend that the speeches
he makes flot only saund like those of the
leader of the Gavernment in the other House.
but they are those speeches.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: They cauld not came
from a hetter man.
The motion was agreed ta.
CANADA'S NATIONAL HEALTH
DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from. Tuesday, April 1,
the adjourned debate an the motion of bon.
Mr. Sauvé.
Hon. J1.b. KING: Honaurable senatars, I
think we are indebted ta the honourable
senator from Rigaud (Hon.. Mr. Sauvé) for

SENATE
his resolution of March 26 and the address he
delivered in support of it. The resolution
itself is:
Resolved that this House respectfully recommends that the Department of National Health
of Canada do:
(a) Deal more severely with the elements
detrimental to health, espe~cially with the increasing misuse of broadcast advertisements
recommending panaceas or certain commercial
articles of food and drink;
(b) Sec that the danger of the abuse of
unsuitable foods and beverages be taught
wiidely by the Press and the radio and in
sehools:
(c) Spread knowledge of the properties of
wholesome foods and beverages.
I personally commend the resolution.
I think it would be well to indicate what
Parliament has done to protect the people
against misbranding of food, drugs, proprietary medicines, and so forth, and false statements in advertising. We find in section 7
of the Food an'd Drugs Act, passed by Parliament in 1927, a provision regarding the misbranding of food and drugs. The section reads:
Food or drug shall be deemed to be misbranded within the meaning of this Act
(e) If false or exaggerated claims are made
for it upon the label or otherwise.
Then section 32 provides:
Every person who
(a) Attaches to any article or package of
food or drug sold or offered or exposed for
sale any label or mark containing ,any untrue
or nisleading name, device, or statement; or
(b) Neglects or refuses to label or mark
any article or package of food or drug in
accordance with the requirements of this Act;
shall for a first offence be liable, upon summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding two
hundred dollars and costs and not less than
fifty dollars and costs, or to imprisonent
for any term not exceeding three months, or
to both fine and imprisonment, and for each
subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding three
bundred dollars and costs and not less than
fifty dollars and costs, or to imprisonment
for any term not exceedling six months, or to
both fine and imprisonment.
That is the section given hY the Parliament
of Canada to the Department of Health to
enable it to protect the public against misbranding o.r false statements in regard te food
and drugs.
In December. 1932, the then Minister of
Pensions and National Health, the Hon. Dr.
Murray MacLaren, entered into an agreement
with Mr. Charlesworth, Chairman of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, whereby
all commercial scripts were to be submitted to
the departrent for approval before authority
was given to broadcast. The scripts were submitted in triplicate. After revision one copy
was retained by the department, tbe others
being returned te the Broadcasting Commission. On November 12. 1934, it was arranged
and agreed that representatives of the departWon. Mr. XINC

ment should be appointed and be given
authority to enter broadcasting stations for
the purpose of reviewing scripts which had
been broadcast, in order to ascertain whether
or net they had, been broadcast in the identical
form authorized by the department. These
representatives were also instructed to listen
to broadeasts to sec if they conformed with
the script as approved by the department. In
April, 1933, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting
Commission. under the statutory authority
which it had, promulgated certain regulations
regarding the broadcasting of advertisements
for food and drugs. These were known as
regulations 90 and 91, and they read as follows:
90. No broadcasting station may broadcast
any speech. printed matter, programme or advertising matter containing abusive or defamatory statements with regard to individuals
or institutions, or statements or suggestions
contrary to the express purpose of any existing
legislation; as for example, the Patent Medicine
Act or 'any regulations promulgated thereunder.
91. The Commission reserves the right to
prohibit the broadcasting of any matter until
the continuity or record or transcription, or
both, bave been submitted to the Commission
for ex.amination and have been approved by
them.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: That was mentioned in
my remarks.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable gentleman permit me to ask him
a question, which he can answer probably as
well as any-one? The motion affirms as a
fact that there is an "incrcasing misuse of
broadcast advertiseients recommending panaceas" and se on. Does he think that is correct?
I had the opposite impression, that that kind
of thing had been greatly reduced.
Hon. Mr. KING: I thought se, too. I shall
deal with that a little liter on.
At the
moment I merely want to indicate the
authority that Parliament has given te the
department, and the arrangement entered into
between the department and the broadcasting
authorities, for the control of advertising relating to foods and drugs.
The agreement entered into with the
Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission
was continued by the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, and in 1936 the Broadcasting
Corporation, under the statutory power it
possesses, issued certain regulations regarding
the control of broadcasts concerning foods
and drugs. These are a little more extensive,
and fully express the hope and desire of the
department in the matter. They were promulgated under section 13 of "Regulations for
Broadcasting Stations made under the Canadian Broadcasting Act, 1936." The section has

APRIL 3, 1941
six subsections, and instead of reading them
I ask permission to have .them placed upon
Hansard.
13. (1) No continuity advertising an article
marketed under the Proprietary or Patent Medicine Act or the Food and Druge Act may be
broadcast until it bas 'been approved by the
Department of Pensions and National Health.
Continuities submitted for approval &hall be
forwarded, in duplicate, to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Ottawa, at least two weeks
in advance of intended use. The formula for
any article 'bearing a distinctive or trade name
distinguishing it from any other produet, and
marketed under the Food and Drugs Act, shall
be submitted wi-th each pertinent continuity.
(2) No electrical transcription .advertising an
article marketed under the Proprietary or
Patent Medicine Act or the Food and Drugs
Aot shall be broadoast by any station unless
certified by an affidavit that the advertising
eontinuity bas been approved by the Department of Pensions and National Health.
(3) No announcer may broadcast any statement concerning any article marketed under
the Food and Drugs Act or the Proprieta
or Patent Medicine Act that is not contained
in the continuity approved 'by the Department
of Pensions and National Health.
(4) Testimoniale referring to an article
marketed under the Food and Drugs Act or
the Proprietary or Patent Medicine Aot shall
be regarded as constituting a part of the
advertising continuity.
(5) No continuity recommending any treatment for any ailment shall be broadcast until
.it has been approved by the Department of
Pensions and National Health.
(6) Inspectors of Food and Drugs, Department of Pensions and National Health, are
authorized to act as representatives of the
Corporation for the purpose of enforcing this
regulation.
I listened to and have since read the speech
of my honourable friend from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauvé), and I concur in much of what he
He suggested that the department
said.
should deal more severely with elements
detrimental to health, and he intimated that
the departmental branch charged with the
responsibility of doing this work was probably
understaffed, comprising, as it does, only two
persons. To a certain extent that is true.
I have been in the office of these two empfloyees, one man and one woman, whose
business it is to review labels and the advertising matter submitted by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation. If these labels and
advertising matter conform to the department's requirements they are approved; if they
do not conform, or are on the border-line,
they are referred to the Chief Dominion
Analyst, Mr. Lancaster. I know him very
well. He is one of the senior officers of the
department, a man who, I think, is seriously
trying to protect the public against false
advertising. If you asked people in the trade
about him, they would probably indicate a
feeling that Mr. Lancaster is over-secrupulous
and over-careful. I know that when any of

13'd

these borderdine cases are referred to him,
he deals with the question very thoroughly
and effectively.
As to the proposal that an educational
campaign be conducted through the Press, the
radio and schools, in regard to "the danger
of the abuse of unsuitable foods and beverages," I should say that this is a matter to
which the Department of National Health is
undoubtedly giving very careful consideration
to-day. Indeed, I feel sure that this matter
is being given serious study by not only that
department, but also the Departments of
Heafth in all the provinces of Canada, in the
United States, Great Britain and Europe and
throughout the world.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bas
co-operated to the fullest extent with the
department, but some private broadcasting
stations have not always done so. The broadcasting regulations that I mentioned have
undoubtedly clarified and amplified the control over broadcast advertisements of foods
All broadcasts, whether they

originate in Canada or in the United States,
which are carried on the network of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation or on
private stations in Canada, are required to
be submitted to the corporation for review
by the department. This applies not only
to broadcasts that are spoken by someone
actually in the station, but to electrical transcriptions ar well.
I think I may fairly say thsat the Department of Health came into being in 1918,
towards the end of the last war. Prior ta
that the only matters of health that the
Government of Canada seemingly was interested in were those coming under the
headings of quarantine, immigration inspection
and care of lepers, who were then quite
numerous in this country. But out of the
war arose a condition that made it necessary
for the Government to establish some organization responsible for the care and treatment of
our soldiers returning from Europe either
wounded or ill. Before the Department of
Health was established there was the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, under
which hospitals for the treatment of soldiers
were built and operated.
Up to 1918 health matters had been entirely
under the control of provincial Departments
of Health, and in the Act setting up the
Dominion department the Governmentvery wisely, I think-made provision for maintaining contact with the provincial authorities.
This was donc by the establishment of the
Dominion Council of Health, composed, of the
Deputy Ministers of the Dominion Department of Health and the various provincial

Departments of Health. The contact with
the various provinces which was made possible
through this body bas resulted in more or
less uniformity in health matters throughout

Canada.
development attributable to the co-operative
work carried on through this council. The
country at that time was faced with the
problem of controlling and treating certain
disesses contracted during the war. For the
control and treatment of venereal diseases the
Federal Government voted a sum of $200,000.
which was supplemented by provincial appropriations, and in the larger cities of every
province, I believe, free clinics were established under provincial jurisdiction. These
appropriations were continued by the varions
governments from year to year. I am quite
satisfied in my own mind that no expenditure
ever gave a greater return to the people of
Canada. To justify this opinion I need only
cite the experience of one of the largest
hospitals in Canada. Prior to the establishment of these clinics, actual blond tests of alil
patients entering that institution showed that
12.8 per cent of them were infected with some
form of venereal disease, but in 1939 the
same kind of tests showed the number of
infected. patients there to be less than 1-2 per
cent.
In 1928 I happened to be Minister of the
Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment and also of the Department of Health.
It seemed to me and to the officers in the
Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment that since the policy had been pretty well
defined, it would be well, for the purpose of
dealing with the treatment and care of
returned soldiers suffering from disease contracted in the last war, to amalgamate the
department with the Department of Health.
To this end legislation was passed establishing what is now known as the Department of
Pensions and National Health.
I should like to make clear that in the
adoption of this course there was never any
intention or desire to interfere with the
independence of the Pensions Commission.
EIowever, I do think the amalgamation of the
two departments brought about a closer relationship between the Pensions Commission
and our various
departmental hospitals
throughout Canada.
I do not think it is realized what a tremendous work the department is doing in the
care of the returned men of the last war and
of this war. Throughout Canada from Halifax
to Victoria we have established hospitals in
which veterans of the last war are being
treated for ailments contracted or injuries sustained during active service. In order that
Hon. Mr. KING.

honourable members may appreciate the
extent of this work, I desire to put on Hansard
the following particulars:

Contracts with private hospitals are flexible
as to the number of beds required, but a
recent survey indicates that in an emergency
12,000 beds in non-departmental hospitals
could be made available.
For the last three years the department bas
had the co-operation of the entire Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation chain and of many
private stations in presenting daily, over
fifty-nine radio units, reminders to Canadians
of the importance of health »conservation.
These broadcasts, consisting of fifty-word
bulletins read by the station announcers,
have all been written by the Director of
Publicity and Health Education, with a view
to reminding listeners of existing facilities in
the Dominon for the maintenance of health.
Frequently the public is told to maintain
close relationship with the family physician,
but care is taken at all times to avoid anything in the nature of medical advice or
any injunction which would encourage personal diagnosis or home treatment.
The
response to these radio talks bas been very
gratifying, and the department has received
applications for literature, which, I may add,
is provided free to all who are interested in
health conservation.
At present over five
hundred personal requests are received daily.
Last year the department distributed nearly
a quarter of a million health pamphlets and
several new booklets were prepared for the
purpose of .meeting demands for information

APRIL 3, 1941
on numerous health topics. I have on my
desk a number of these bookiets, and in order
to show the diversity and extent of the field
covered, I might mention a few of the tite:
Food for Health in Peace and War; Home
Treatmnent; Rural Water Supply; Holiday
Health; What You Should Know About
Tuberculosis; Middle Age-Your Arteries and
Heart. I understand the Canadian Medical
Association has been very help<ful to the
department by furnishing much of the information embodied ini these booklets.
The department has been encouraged ini
its work by the fact that many schools and
labour organizations, and even large industries, have shown an interest in these radio

instance, several big companies have asked
for thousands of national health books for
distribution to their employees, and have
commended the department on this phase of
its work. I understand the department bas also
had similar requests from health authorities
ini the United States, Newfoundland and
Australia.
It should be pointed out that this radio
work has been carried on fromn week to week
without cost to the Government. This bas
been made possible because of the bearty
co-operation flot only of the C.B.C., but also
of the private radio stations throughout
Canada.
To-day research work on a considerable
scale is being conducted in regard to what I
may termi the chemistry of the human or
animal body; that is, as to what bappens to
food once it is taken into the mouth and
passed through the digestive systemn into the
blood and the glandular system. 1 believe
that very valuable resilts will shortly accrue
from these studies.
However much the scope of our knowledge
may be enlarged in regard to health matters,
we must not expect that the Department' of
Health will be able to prescribe for us en
masse, for the simple reason that apparently
Nature desires it otherwise. For instance, we
know that no two stomachs nor two livers are
alike, and that no two individuals react in
the samne way to physical- or mental stimuli.
The depart-ment is carring on important
research work, and I was hi-ghly pleased with
what I saw and learned in a recent visit I
made to its laboratories. When I was Minister of the departmen the laboratories were
situated on Elgin street in wbat was originally
a hotel. In the basement of that old building a few oflicials carried on biological and
chemical work under the most unfavourable
conditions. The new laboratories on Sussex
14879-10j

street are admirably located and are equipped
with facilities unsurpassed anywhere, and 1
have no doubt that our scien-tists in charge of
those laboratories are as able as any who cani
be found on this continent or i.n Europe.
They are engaged. in research work requiring
the most skilful technique. Last year, in order
to carry on their biological tests, the laboratory
staff raised 25,000 rats. They have also a
plentiful supply of mice, rabbits, guinea-pigs,.
frogs and roosters. These animals are used
in the testing of foods and drugs.
During the past few years great strides have
been made in our knowledge of certain active
principles known as vitamins. These are found
in foods derived from both the animal and
the vegetable kingdom. Vitamins are being
discovered so rapidly that the staff can scarcely
find means of testing their existence and extent
in certain foods. The rats, mice and other
animaIs I have mentioned are used in
biologîcal tests to determine the potency and
quantity of vitamins in foods and also to
ascertain the chemical composition of drugs.
If members of this House or of the Commons wish to spend a plieasant afternoon, they
could not better employ their titne tha-n
by visiting these laboratories and acquainting
themselves with the valuable work that is
being done there.
During my visit I found that, in addition to
the type of research work which I *have
described, the staff, in association with the
bakers and millers of this country, were trying
to develop a flour with a higher vitamîn
content. In the United States the millers are
enriching their product by introducing vitamins
directly into the four. We are boping to get
similar or even better results by so milling
the flour as to, preserve the maximum vitamin
content of the wheat it-self.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I helieve that
under the supervision of the Research Institute of the University of Toronto that
famous food research scientist of Clinton,
Ontario-whose name I have forgotten at the
moment-bias developed a flour rich in vitamins. I know the flour is in production.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think it is being
marketed with the knowledge of the department.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KING: My information is that
the department hopes as a result of its
researches to discover a milling process that
wiIl preserve the full vitamin content of four.
The Government bas realized the value of
certain semi-public organizations. From year
to year grants have been made to such organizations as the Red Cross, Child Welfare,

140

SENATE

Mental Hygiene, the Victorian Order of
Nurses, and the Canadian Council of Health.
These organizations have facilities for reaching the public and securing financial support,
and it does seem to me that because of their
closer association with the people they are
able to carry on much more effective propaganda in support of health education than a
department of Government can be expected
to accomplish. In some cases I do not believe
our Government departments could get the
same results through the radio and the Press
as are being obtained by the semi-public
organizations.
The activities of the Red Cross are well
known. At all times of emergency it is ready
to relieve suffering, and in time of war its
work is undoubtedly of great and continuing
value. As honourable members are aware, it
is international in scope. The Child Welfare
organization is also a well managed institution. Its work is, I think, familiar to most
of our provincial governments. In my province of British Columbia it performed a very
valuable service by advising the provincial
authorities on the care and disposition of
orphan children. It is at present giving considerable study to Lhe problem of caring for
evacuce children from Great Britain and
European countries.
In the development of a hcalth programme
many factors must come into the picture; for
example, the province, the local community,
voluntary agencies, and the Federal Government. Under our constitution the Federai
Government can stimulate these agencies by
sanctioning their activities and granting subsidies. There is no doubt that governiments,
as well as the people, are becoming more
health-conscious. This is evidenced by the
health programmes instituted by the British
Government prior to the war. The measures
taken have. J am sure. contributed to the
maintenance of the public health during the
trying times through whieh the British people
have lived last fall and winter.
We have secn also tremendous strides in
health matters in the United States. The
Federal Governnent there. like our own, is
somewhat limited in its action; but some two
or tIhree years ago it recognized the seriousness of conditions in regard to venereal disease.
and' Congress voted some $650.000,000, to be
expended, in conjunction with various State
Health Departments, for the purpose of trying
to control this menace. The Government,
which is now engaged in reorganizing the
country's defence services, apparently recognizes the importance of heal-th measures in
connection with its rearmament programme.
I think I may quote briefly from an address
lon. Mr. KING.

delivered by the President of the United States
at the dedication of the National Institute of
Health, at Bethesda, Maryland, in October
of 1940. He said:
To-day the need for the conservation of
health and physical fitness is greater than at
any time in the nation's history... .The total
defence that we have heard so much about of
late. that total defence which this nation seeks,
involves a great deal more than building aeroplanes, ships, guns and bombs.... We cannot be
a strong nation unless we are a healthy nation.
And so we must recruit not only men and
materials, but also knowledge and science in
the service of national strength....
We have recognized the strategie importance
of health by the creation of a health and
medical committee in the Council of National
Defence itself. That committee has the job of
co-ordinating the bealth and medical aspects of
T
national preparedness.
hiat committee is
assisting the Government in the mobilization of

the medical and health resources of the country
to serve the best interests both of the military
and the civilian elements of the nation.
To do this will require the best energies of
the professional and technical leadership everywbere in the United States.
In December. 1940, the present Minister of
Health, Hon. Ian Mackenzie, placed on Hansard a statement dealing with the rehabilitation
of veterans, and post-war reconstruction. The
Minister set out the studies and efforts to be
undertaken to deal with these problems, and
indicated that it was his purpose to establish
in the department a new division, to be known
as the Veteren Welfare Division. In the
statement. which is well worth reading, because it is prepared with great care, the
Minister indicates that inter-departmental
committees are to-day engaged in a complete
study, making use of the knowxledge gained in
the last war, so that w-ben this war is over
they will be in a position to deal with the
problems that will follow in its wake. Under
the War Measures Act, Orders in Council have
been passed whicb make provision for the
care of pensioneble disabilities arising out of
this war. and in the House of Comnons a
committec iN now revising the Pension Act so
as to make it applicable to present-day conditions. The proposed amendment will come to
the Sonate before the se-sion closes.
A few moments ago I referred to several
subsidized organizations which are engaged in
issuing public health propaganda. I wish now
for a moment to set out briefly what one of
these organizations lias contributed to the
welfare of the general public. I refer to the
Health League of Canada. The Director of
that league bas appeared hefore the Senate
Committee on Public Health and Inspection
of Foods on two occasions, when he se impressed the committee that it brought te the
Senate resolutions commending the work of

A.PRIL 3, 1941
the league and intimating that a further expenditure by way of public grant would lie in
the interest of the nation.
The Healti League of Canada came ito
being in 1919. It was then known as the
National Committee for Combating Venereal
Disease. Later on, as the healti field developed, it cianged its namne to the one it is
now known by. . In addition to a grant from
the Federal Government it lias received generous support from the public. It lias existed
for twenty years under tic samne presidentI believe Mr. Justice Riddell is the president
-and the same main officers.
One of its earliest and most useful contributions came wlien clinies were being set up
througiout Canada. It produced two moving
pictures, one known as "The End of the
Road," and the otier as "Damaged Lives."
The last-mentioned picture was produced iii
Hollywood, California, under the supervision
of the league, and lias been shown in al
English-speaking countries, as weli as in many
foreign countries, including the whole of
Central America, India, China, the Duteli
West Indies and thc Philippines. Countless
millions have seen the picture. In Great
Britain in one year over five million people
attended the showings.
I am advised by people in Toronto who
are closely associated with liealtli matters
there that this organization did muci to assist
the City Healti Department-whici is one of
the best municipal healtli departments in
Canada-i making the people of Toronto
conscious of the fact that it was possible to
immunize their cbildren against diphtieria.
Prior to the campaign on immunization, there
were, in a maximum year, 1,022 cases of
diphtheria, witb 65 deatbs, in the city of
Toronto. Since tien there lias been a gradual
decline-I have a chart bere showing the situation-and in 1940, mucli to the credit of the
people of that second largest city in Canada,
there wvas not one case of diphtheria. I am
told that a similar campaign is being initiated
in the great city of Montreal. If it is carried
tlirough to completion, the result there sliould
lie the same. I understand that already the
Red Cross bas immunized the children of
Prince Edward Island. It is suci organizations as this, which receive lielp from the
federal and provincial authorities and bave
public support, that are able to do these
things, and I am in favour of their being
supported by tic Federal Govérnment to tic
extent, at least, of assuring thc continuation
of their administrative offices.
I am told, and I believe I may repeat it
without fear of contradiction, that when the
Government of Ontario decided tiat it would

141

be ini the interest of the people to bring
about the general pasteurization of milk ini
that province, this organization helped
materially through its propaganda towards
gaining the consent of the people of the
province. I have here a memorandum from
the Minister of Health of Ontario which
shows what happened. The legisiation which
made pasteurization compulsory in ail cities
and towns came into effect in 1938. Other
areas were designated later. In 1940 al
cities, towns and villages having a population
of five hundred or over were included, and
ninety-eight per cent of the milk used i
the province was pasteurized. Some of the
resuits are these: the quality of the milk is
better; there has been a reduction i disease;
the mortality from typhoid fever in the
province lias dropped fifty per cent, until
Ontario now lias the lowest typhoid deathrate of any province in Canada, and a rate
which is lower than that i most of the
states of the United States. Similarly, there
have been a drop of about forty-five per
cent in the number of cases of undulant
fever and a marked reduction i tuberculosis.
Other diseases, ucli as paratypboid, diarrhoea
and enteritis among infants and young cildren, have likewise shown, a downward trend.
I have no doulit that wlien these figures are
known and understood throughout the other
provinces, there will be a similar development tiere in thc matter of pasteurization.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Will the
honourable gentleman permit me a question?
I hope lie will flot object to giving his
opinion, wliatever At may lie.
Hon. Mr. KING: Very good.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
question at ail the statement that pasteurization reduces the danger of disease, but lias
the honourable gentleman any opinion as to
whether or not pasteurisation in any way
impairs the nutritive value of milk?
Hon. Mr. KING: As I have no technical
knowledge on the matter, 1 should not care
to express an opinion. I know that the question raised by my right bonourable friend lias
been uppermost in the minds of many people,
some of Whom are concemned with health
matters. I think lie would find upon inquiry
that, generally speaking, persons who have
made a study of this problemi are convinced
now that pasteurization does not deprive milk
of any element essential to the nourisliment
of the human body.

142

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BOURQUE: Did my honourable
friend notice a recent statement in the Press
to the effect that the American Medical
Association has expressed an opinion against
the pasteurization of milk?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that is true, but
I am advised that, generally speaking, the
opinion prevails in health circles to-day that
pasteurization has many advantages and does
not have any deteriorating effect upon the
nourishing qualities of milk.
Further examples could be given of the
usefulness of such organizations as I have
mentioned. I speak of them from knowledge
gained as a physician and when I'was Minister. I firmly believe that they are well
qualified for the work they undertake, and that
for the public funds voted to them the people
get a manifold return. I have made it a point
to speak of the Health League of Canada at
this time because I regret to see that the
federal subsidy to that organization, which
was formerly $20,000, has been cut te $5,000.
The Government has apparently thought the
urgent demand for money to buy planes and
guns justifies this reduction, but as a member
of the Senate and a supporter of the Government I have no hesitation in saying I think
this is false economy. The league is doing a
good work in Canada. The services it is
rendering in Quebec are recognized by the
provincial Government, which is going to make
a grant to the organization.
In closing, honourable senators, I express
my conviction that from year te year, as we
advance in our knowledge of health matters
and more fully realize governmental responsibility with respect to them, the Department of
National Health will become increasingly useful and important in this country. And I am
sure other countries will witness a similar
development of their Departments of Health.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Bourque, the debate
was adjourned.
BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I would ask that the Senate suspend its sitting for a few minutes while I
endeavour to learn whether there is any
likelihood that the two Supply Bills now
under consideration in the other House will
be sent over to us this evening.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. KING.

ADJOURNMENT-WITHHOLDING
EXEATS

OF

DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, there is a strong probability that two
supplementary bills will reach this House
to-morrow. I am told that they will certainly
be passed by the House of Commons this
evening. In these circumstances I would move
that when the Senate adjourns this evening it
stand adjourned until half-past two in the
afternoon to-morrow.
We may have the
advantage of Royal Asssent some time after
3 o'clock. If that proposal is agreeable to the
Senate, such is my motion.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I am net rising to object to
the motion, but I desire to bring a matter to
the notice of the leader of the House, and it
may be impossible for me to do se to-morrow.
I refer to the withholding of exeats from persons who wish to go te England to serve in
some war capacity. I know restrictions must
be placed upon the movements of Canadian
civilians in the war zone. This is covered by
an Order in Council of June 4 last, under
which it is provided that civilians, particularly
women, may net move there except by
special permit. Permits, I understand, have
been granted only to persons in the armed
forces-women cannot be in these forces-and
te minors whose parents presumably are overseas; also, I believe, te persons engaged in the
public service of Canada.
The class which I have particularly in mind
covers women applicants who desire to enlist
in the Auxiliary Territorial Services of Britain.
As ve all know, the population of Great
Britain is being combed through and through.
Men well on in middle life are being impressed
into service, and women with the requisite
qualifications are being taken in large numbers
into various auxiliary services which until
recent months had been confined to men. The
need of women for war service in Britain is
recognized universally. There is no talk there
of their not being needed. Their ranks are
being combed through and through with the
utmost thoroughness.
Now, there are in this country many women
who have tried te get into those auxiliary
services-purely, of course, out of a desire te
do something in the great struggle. I have in
mind one case in particular-and I presume
there must be quite a number-where the
applicatit has been accepted by one of those
auxiliary services, to be taken on the strength
immediately on her arrival, because of her

APRIL 3, 1941
qualifications, including ability to bandie motor
vehicies. She has been examined and, accepted
for a vital service at the battie front, subject
only to passing a medical exarnination after
arrivai in England; and the record of lier
medical examination here shows she could
flot fail to pase such a test. Notbing more
can bie done in Canada to quai'ify lier. She
is not on.iy eager, shie bas been pleading to
go for al.most a year; not at the expense
of tbe public, but at 'bier own. She canflot get an exeat from the Goverument of
Canada. This to me seerna indefensible. I
have not communicated diret with tbe
Department of External Affairs, because 1
bad no reason to tbink any letter from me
would get any further tban the letters of
those whose correspondience I read. The rely
is stereotyped: "Here is the Order in Council.
We bave to confine exceptions to min or
children and to women in the armed forces."
Women cannot get into the armed forces,
and they cannot get into -the nursing service
unless tbýey are competent, qualified nurses.
There is utter, steady ignoring of tbe fact that
tbis person appiying for an exeat bas been
accepted by -the auxiiiary services in Engiand
and wants to go.
This refusai to grant an exeat bas continued
rnonth after month. I do flot see wby it
sbould be. It is true we do flot want women
indisorirninately meandering around the war
zone !of Europe, but we are at a stage in this
war where ini many cases women can bie just
as useful as men. We bave no sucb auxiliary
war services in Canada, though tbe time may
corne when we shall need them. I hope it wilI
not, but if it does it will be a much blacker
day for us tban the present. Why shouid
not those who want to enter tbose services be
ailowed to go overseas? 1 cannot understand
the refusai. The granting of exeats is in
charge of the Departmnent of External Affairs.
1 arn teld there are 1,5W0 similar cases. The
departinent knows this person bas been
accepted for service overseas. Letters from the
departinent lead me týo believe that the other
wornen are iikewise qualified. If they are,
wby are exeats not granted?
A passport bas been granted in this particular
case, but transportation cannot bie obtained
without the exeat of the department, and, as I
have said, this is refused. Not only does the
departrnent refuse, but the passport sent down
for the purpose of getting the exeat is retained,
and the sender cannot get it back. This would
seern to indicate the officiais of the department. are not alive to their responsibilities.
I bave not spoken to the leader of the House;
so bie cannot bie expected to, know the facts;
but I wish hie wouid draw this case, and draw
it eneogetically, te the attention of the head
of the Departmnent of Externai Affairs.

.Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will certainly do so witb pleasure. My right bonourable friend thinks that the officiais, faced
with the Order in Ceuncil, will net take
action. I should bie very much surprised if
knowledgc cf the situation described by rny
right honourable friend bas net reacbed
Council, for it is there that the prohibition
originated. I know that at a certain period
the authorities in London were reluctant to
ailow persons to corne over to offer their
services, there being no special need at the
timie. But since then, I recognize, the situation bas changed considerably. I will find
eut wbether after consultation witb Great
Britain the Order stands because of the decision of the two Governments. I will try
to obtain the information desired, and even
if we bave adjourned I wili communicate to
my right honourahie friend the answer I get
from the Departmnent of Externai Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.

SUPPLEMENTARY 1940 WAR
PRIATION BILL

APPRO-

FIRST READING

A message was receîved fremn the Heuse of
Cemmens with Bill 25, an Act for granting
to His Majesty aid fer National Defence and
Security.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND, with leave
of the Senate, moved the second reading of
the Bill.

SENATE
He said: The purpose of this Bill is to
provide for the amount of money spent during the year 1940-1941 for war purposes. It
will be remembered that in August last, when
the Minister of Finance asked for $700,000,000,
he stated that he might have to ask for a
supplementary amount, which he then placed
at $240,000,000. In January last, at the time
of the Dominion-Provincial Conference on
the Sirois report, he thought the sum required would be about $175,000,000. When
the House reconvened he reduced this figure
to $150,000,000. This week, after a close revisien of the expenditure, he brought to the
House an estimate still further reduced, the
amount asked being $135,000,000, which includes $15,820,700 to cover unforeseen contingencies. This is a considerably better figure
than the Minister gave us last year. We
have in consequence to register the fact that
our war expenditure, apart from the $15,000,000
asked under this Bill for unforeseen contingencies, has amounted to about $815,000,000.
With this very brief explanation, I move
the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. JAMES CALDER: Honourable members, I take it that this Bill covers only
war expenditures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As most of the money,
if not all, has been spent, there is very little
more we can do on this occasion than express
the hope that the money has been well
spent and every care has been exercised
to secure as much economy as possible under
the circumstances.
inasmuch as the expenditure of funds is
necessary for the prosectiotin of the war, I

opened and everybody will have the right
to say what he pleases. I rather like the
attitude taken by Churchill and Beaverbrook
in the Old Country. They are not afraid of
criticism. They welcome constructive criticism
-yes, all kinds of criticism. They take the
view that it is helpful. They say to Parliament, to the Press and to the public: "Keep
on with it. It helps us to check up, to recheck, and to improve our efforts in se far
as the administration of affairs is concerned."
But in some Government quarters at Ottawa
there is an inclination to be a little afraid
of criticism, shall I say? I am talking not
only

of

constructive

criticism,

but

of

any

kind.
My wish is that members of the
Administration would endeavour to avoid
that attitude and would net be afraid of
criticism of any sort. After all, the Government need have no fear if its course is correct.

I say this simply by the way.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The honourable senator
will net say, I am sure, that the Government
is not getting its fair share of criticism, both
the constructive and the other kind.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Well, we have not
had a great deal of it in the Senate this
session.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: No, we have not.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND, with leave of the
Senate. moved the third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third tine, and passed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2
FIRST READING

A message was rceive fromx the Hoise of
Comomotis with Bill 57, an Act for granting
to His Majcsty certain suns of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1941.
SECOND READING

lion. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second neadiog cf the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, with leave
of the Senate. I would moe the second
reading now. This Bill, too, covers expendittre for the fiscal year 1940-41, which ended
on Monday last. It asks for 878,741,584.32,
to fulfil the dernands that were made upon the
Treasury by the various departments. These
mtoneys have all been expended, and all the
items have been closely scrutinized. I have

APRIL 4, 1941
the impression that some of themn were authorized by special warrants. The Bill was passed
in the House of Commons last evening,
after discussion Iasting only an hour or two,
on the unde.rstanding that when the main
estimates for the curren.t fiscal year corne
before the buse any item in this Bill may be
discussed and criticized. That is in conformity
with the suggestion of ýmy -honourable friend
who is leading the opposite side tihis afternoon (Hon. Mr. C alder). Some of the expenditures covered by this Bill are controllable,
and others are not. In any event, we are
simply asked now to approve payments which
have already been made.
Hon. JAMES CALDER: Honourable senstors, this is a perennial measure which springs
into ife around the close of the fiscal year.
We ail know it is impossible for any goverfiment to estisuate exactly what the expenditures
for a year wi1l be. Unforeseen circuatances
arise, and votes are found to be insufficient
for work that has to lie carried on. Then
warrants have to lie issued, and as a consequence there is tihis annual measure. Here
again, as the lionourable leader of the House
lias said, the rnoney has already been expended.
Without our having a knowledge of the details,
nothing would be gained by discussing the
measure at any length at ail.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. IDANDURAND, witli leave of the
Senate, moved the third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
EASTER IIECESS
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members have heard the message advising us
that the Right Honourable the Deputy of the
GovvFrnor General will attend in this Chamber
at a quarter past three for the purpose of
giviog Royal Assent to the Bis we have just
passed. and as well to others, the most important bcinig the Appropriation Bill granting

$1,300.00,000 for war purposes during the
combog year, and the customary interim Supp'ly
Bill. After this ceremony we shahl have finished
our legislative labours for the time being.
The Hlouse of Commons intends to adjourn
next, Wednesday until April 28. It had been
rumoured that before adjournment the Minister of Finance would bring down his Budget, but yesterday lie stated that he would
not bo able to do su until after the Easter
recess.

145

In these circunistances I have been asking
myseIf what business could corne to us from
the Commons shortly after they reassemble
on April 28, for I arn convinced that tliey
wilI take at least a couple of weeks, perliaps
longer, to dehate the Budget. Accordingly 1
have decided to move that ýwlen the Senate
adjourns this evening it stand adjourned to
Tuesday, May 13 next, at 8 o'clock in the
evening. This will allow two weeks for the
Commons to deal witli the Budget. Then
they will be engaged on consequential bills
that flow from the Budget. In view of this, I
wouid not dare tell my coileagues that there
will be anything to engage our attention on
the 13tli of May, and, as I have a good deal
of consideration for those senators wlio live
far away from the Capital, I would ask them
to watch progress ini the Commons until
within a few days of the l3tli of May, in,
order to judge -for tliemselves wlietlier there
is any likelihood of legislation being ready for
us when we return liere. If no bills reach us
from the Commons, we may bave to mark
time for a few days and perhaps adjourn for
a further period.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Could, not some
arrangement lie made to inform those of us
who reside far away from Ottawa whether
it is absolutely necessary for us to attend, on
May 13?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn keeping
that in mind and will do my level best to
accommodate my colleagues from the extreme
West and East by informing thema as to what
the Senate may do on May 13. That is my
motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Wiil the notice to which
the honourable leader refers lie sent elso to
some of us who corne from Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If that notice
reaclies members beyond Manitoba, it wil
certeinly reach those in thet province.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If you send it, it certainly
will.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. The Canadian Press Association could accept from me
a notice which would cover the whole country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What I have in mind is
this. The very able Clerk of this Chamber
could be instructed to send us a message
containing information on which we eould
judge for ourselves whether or not we should
be in attendance on May 13. Before we
resumed in March he very kindly sent me, at
my request, a telegram containing information
which was very accurate and very useful to me.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: His Honour the
Speaker, the Clerk and myself will assume a
certain responsibility in that respect.
I should perhaps add that in case between
now and May 13 any emergent situation arises,
Ris Honour the Speaker is clothed with
sufficient authority to call us back. Of course,
such action would be concurrent with the
reconvening of the House of Commons.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYSCENTRALIZED TRAFFIC
CONTROL SYSTEM
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, a question was put by the honourable
gentleman from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black) concerning centralized traffic control. I
said I would try to obtain the information
which he was seeking. I now have the following from the Department of Transport:
Prier te the outbreak of war, a study was
made of the line between Pacifie Junction and
Truro, because this section of the Canadian
Nàtional was the most likely te be overstrained
Certain improvements in
by war traffic.
sidings, etc., were made, but under heavy traffic
conditions due to the war, further capacity is
required. Double-tracking of this section of
line would be very difficult, would involve a
very heavy expenditure of money and would
take nearly two years to complete. The railway management therefore decided upon the
installation of centralized traffle control between
Pacifie Junction and Truro.
Centralized trafic control is a method of
operating trains over a section of railway line
without the use of train orders or time-table
authority. A single operator, located at a
central point, sets the switches and signals on
the line by remote control, electrically operated.
In effect, he gives orders to each train on the
line by his control over all signals, also setting
the switches of sidings for trains meeting or
passing other trains. An electrically lighted
diagram in front of the operator shows him the
location of each train on the line, and the
situation with respect te each signal and switch.

147

The system is so interlocked that it is impossible for the operator te set signals or switches
improperly.
The primary purposes of a centralized traffic
control installation are: first, te speed up
operation, thus increasing the capacity of a
line, and, second, although no less important, to
increase the safety of operation.
Since 1927 the system has been installed by
forty different railways in the United States
and Canada for varying distances, several in
excess of 100 miles. Typical examples are as
follows:
Track
miles
Location
Railroad
Boston & Maine-Rigby, Maine-Dover,
N .H ...............................

111
C. B. & Q.-Denver-Akron, Colorado..
D. & H.-Schenevus-Delanson, N.Y....
94
Pennsylvania-Ben Davis, Ind.-West
Casey, III...........................
129
The remote control and operation of signals
and switches is net new in Canada, there
being several installations on Canadian railroads of such operation where weather conditions are comparable te or even worse than
those encountered on the line between Moncton
and Truro.
The fact that the centralized
control is at a considerable distance from a
switch or signal does net change the fundamental principles of the operation of the
equipment.
If it were net for war-time traffic, there
would be no justification for increasing the
capacity of the Pacifie Junction-Truro line by
the installation of centralized traffic control. It
can therefore only be looked upon as an
expenditure chargeable directly te the war.
After the war the equipment can be used te
some advantage in its present location or
transferred to other locations on the Canadian
National.
The estimated cost of centralized traffic
control, namely $1,200,000, is the total cost,
including premium on United States exchange,
duty and all taxes. Approximately one-half
of the estimated cost will be expended for
Canadian labour and materials.
At present levels of traffic the savings in
operation are sufficient te pay interest and
depreciation on the cost of installing centralized
traffic control.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Did the
honourable leader say that this expenditure
on the Canadian National Railways is to be
chargeable to the war, because of the extra
business that makes the expenditure necessary?
I do not think
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my right honourable friend has quite understood the statement. It says:
If it were not for war-time traffic, there would
be no justification for increasing the capacity
of the Pacifie Junction-Truro line by the instalIt can
lation of centralized traffic control.
therefore only be looked upon as an expenditure
chargeable directly to the war. After the war
the equipment can be used te seme advantage
in its present location or transferred te other
locations on the Canadian National.
The estimated cost of centralized traffic
control, namely $1,200,000, is the total cost,

duty -and ail taxes. Approximately one-haîf
of the estimated cost will be expended for
Canadian labour and materials.
At present levels of traffie the savings in
operation are sufficient to pay interest and
depreciation on the cost of installing centralized
traffic control.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
I assumed
that the language used meant that this was to
be chargeable to war expenditure. I do flot
take any other meaning from it, and I would
ask the honourable leader to keep bis eye
wide open and see that the utterly false
bookkeeping foresbadowed in that answer does
flot become effective. Why, if you charged
this as a war expenditure, you would have
te credit ail the Canadian National's extra
income arising from war traffic to the war
account.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have simply
given the statement that came from the
Department of Transport, and will flot
attempt to discuss reasons for what is being
done. As Canadian National Railways affairs
are deait with by what is virtually a standing
committee of the other flouse, this matter
may well be examined by that committee.
THE LATE SENATOR TAYLOR
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
sonators, it is my sorrowful duty offlciaily to
mnform 0cr Chamber of flic demise of the
Ilonourable J. D. Taylor uinder the most
disiressing circumistanccs.
Senator Taylor in the courseý of bis career
was a journalist, a soldier, and a parliamentarian. J ournalismi was bis vocation and hoe
followed it during most of bis lifctime. He
wus attiîehed first f0 the Ottaw~a Citizen and
lafc r liecane a memiber of the Commons Press
Gallery as the rcîcoseutative of Ottawa and
M'ontirea.l new spapers. HIe ivent to British
Columîbia ini 1892 and mado lus début on the
siaff cf the Victoria Colonist. In 1900 hoe
joined thle Britishî Columbian, of New Westminste r. It.jui.t lualpens that to-day xvo have
recriedu a spocial number of that newspaper
celebraling its Slst annix ersary.
Senafor
Ta * lor directed the policy cieli
the
ritish
Colcnibian for forty-ono years. As a journalist
hoe ias notable for bis clarity of expression
and conciseness of style.
Ho toolz. part in the Northwest Ilebellion of
1885. Ho was made a lieutenant-colonel in
1913. In 1916 hoe raised and took overseas the
131st Battalion. As a soldier hoe wvon the
admiration of bis superiors and the devotion
cf bis men.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Senator Taylor began bis parliamentary
career in 1908. Four years carlier he had
run a.s a candidate for New Westminster without success; but hie was elected in 1908, and
again in 1911. Wlîile still a member of the
flouse of Commons hoe was sumnmoned to the
Sonate in 1917. 1 had flot'occasion to follow
bis career in the Commons. Probably some
honourable gentlemen on this aide and my
right honourable friend opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) sat withi him in the other
flouse.
However, in this Chamber I had
opportunity to listen to many cf Senator
Taylor's speeches, and recognized bis splendid
training as a journalist, for hie was weil
informed on ail questions, past and current,
wbich hoe reviewed editorially in ecdi day's
issue cf bis paper. 1 have often noticed that
j ournalists excel in Parliament because cf the
conciseness with whicb they are able te present
their views, and undoubtedly Senator Taylor
was a master in this respect.
1 desire te extend te the members cf bis
family my most sincere sympathy.
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honcurable members, the saddost tlîing that bias

death, under very tragie circumatances, of
J. D. Taylor.

hiim in those days is niuch more clear and

towards the attainment of his very definite

I was fond of J. D. Taylor, and ail of us
who were can find nothing but deep distress
in the thought that his hast hours were

He was a man in every sense of the word,

FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. COPP introduced Bill N2, an Act
to amend the Divorce Jurisdiction Act, 1930.
The Bill was read the first time.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Explain.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, under
the present law a married woman deserted by*
her husband may institute divorce proceedings
only in the province where her busband was
domiciled prior to the desertion. In practice
this bas been found to work considerable hardship, for the woman, by reason of such
desertion, may have been forced to move to
another province. The purpose of this amendment is to enable the deserted woman to
bring action for divorce in the province in
whicb she is residing at the date of the
commencement of such action.

DIVORCE JURISDICTION BIL
MOTION FOR SECOND

READING-

DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill N2, an Act to amend the Divorce
Jurisdictîon Act, 1930.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Henourabile members, this Bill proposes an amendment to the present law with regard te divorce
jurisdiction, whicli amendment certainly seems
to me to lie one of great importance, and one
whicli ouglit not to lie passed witliout careful
consideration. The present law on tlie subjeet
is quoted in full in the explanatory note to
the Bill. Reference to this will show that,
under the statute with regard to jurisdiction
in matters of divorce, any deserted wife wlio
desires to take proceedings against lier husband
for absolute divorce must do so liefore the
courts of the province in whicli the spouses
liad, their matrimonial domicile immedîately
before the desertion. In other words, the
deserted wife is limited, as to, the jurisdiction
of the courts to which she may resort, to
tlie province of lier husliand's home. It is new
proposed to change that altogether and to give
the deserted wife the riglit to proeeed to any
province of the Dominion wliere there is a
divorce court, and to choose that court for
the hearing of lier suit for divorce.
That is a pretty serious change, and the
reasons for it given in the explanatory note
are, I suppose, the only resoens tliat truly
could lie given for the introduction of this
Bill. It is said that
As the law presently stands, the woman may
bring suit only in the province where the

husband was domiciled immediately prior to
the desertion. This condition of the law works
a great hardship on the deserted married woman
who hy reason of such desertion may have been
forced to move to another province f rom that
where the désertion took place. It is unreasonable that she should have to take lier action
back to the former.
I cannot see anything unreasonable ini it.
That former province was lier home. It was
there that the spouses elected to live and
estahuish their matrimonial domicile. The
choice may not have been the wife's, but it
certainly was made with lier assent, and she
is under as mucli obligation to look upon that
province as the place of domicile as her
husband ever is.
But, it is said, it is a liardship that she
sliould flot be allowed to perambulate, to
leave the province of lier domicile and take
lier cause of action along with lier. If it is
any liardship that she should lie obliged to,
liring lier action in lier own province, it surely
is just as mucli a hardship upon the
husband that lie should be taken to a foreigu
province for trial of the action against him.
One can understand that if a man lias de-.
serted bis wife no one will bave mucli sympathy for liim. But it is not a matter of
sympatliy; it is, it seems to, me, a matter of
ordinary justice. If lie is cliarged witli some
matrimonial offence whicli would justify
divorce, be is, I sliould think, entitled
to have that cause of actien tried wliere lie
lives, and wliere, 'presumalily, lie must bave
been when lie committed the offence. If
instead of the matrimonial offence witli whîcli
the man was lieing cbarged it was some offence
against the criminal law, no matter how
trifling the penalty, lie would have to lie tried
where the offence was committed. Wliy sliould
there lie any liardship involved in trying the
matrimonial offence in the same jurisdiction?
But it is flot the husband and wife alone
who are concerned, and whose hardships are
to lie considered. There are some other people
wlio have a riglit to lie considered perhaps
more than the parties themselves; I mean
witnesses. If the deserted wife hrings an
action for absolute divorce upon the only
ground upon whîcli sucli actions are at present
permitted to lie lirouglit, that off ence will
necessarily lie one committed by the husliand
where lie is living, and tlie witnesses to it
must corne from thereabout. Supposing the
offence to have heen committed in Nova
Scotia, is it no liardship upon the Nova Scotia
witness to be taken fromn his own home,
perliaps to Britishi Columbia, for trial of the
wife's action, if the wife happens to have gone
te Britishi Columbia to, bring her suit? It

SENATE
would seem to me that under the provisions
of this Bill there is room for ten times as much
hardship upon innocent parties as there could
be under the present law upon the deserted
wife.
And it is not merely a question of hardship.
It is, I urge, a matter of public importance
whether or not any woman should have the
legal right to select any province she pleases
for the bringing of an action of divorce. That
right is literally what this proposed amendment would confer. The only purpose of the
Bill is to change the law so that the wife
may bring such action in the province in which
she is residing at the time of the commencement of the proceedings. It is not necessary
that she should have resided there one day before the bringing of the action; if she is personally present in the province where her suit for
divorce is brought, the courts of that province
are given jurisdiction to hear and determine
the case.
Think of the consequences which necessarily
would result if this proposed amendment
became law. Any deserted woman could,
af ter consultation with ber legal advisers,
decide in which province of the seven in
Canada where divorce courts are established
she would like to have ber divorce case tried.
She having so decided, the papers necessary
for the introduction of a suit could all be
prepared in a solicitor's office and the good
lady could carry those papers along in ber
travelling bag, and, as soon as she reached
the desired station in the province selected,
take a taxi to the law courts and institute
proceedings. For she would be resident in
that province at the time the action was
begun; she would not need to have been there
even overnight. To pass such an amendment
is to go a long way afield. We often see
references in the newspapers to Reno divorces,
but I think it is the law even in Nevada that
there must be some little residence beforehand
to give jurisdiction to the courts of that state.
What possible jurisdiction, under circumstances such as I have indicated, could the
courts of the province selected by the wife
have over the absent husband? Very likely
he would be glad to be rid of the woman and
would not think of defending the proceedings;
but if he happened to be a man with some
regard for his reputation, and were innocent
of the offence charged against him, and
wanted to defend himself, he would have a
perfect right to say to the courts 'of that
province: "It is a province in which I have
never set foot in my life, and your courts
have no jurisdiction to decree a dissolution
of my marriage contract."
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

But, apart altogether from any questions of
jurisdiction or of the right of this Parliament
to confer jurisdiction in a matter of this kind,
is it expedient that Parliament should permit
a proceeding such as this amendment would
undoubtedly allow? Nothing is indicated in
the Bill in the way of preventing the woman
from resorting to one court after another if
she fails in the first. If she has not made a
good choice, if she fails in lier first proceeding,
all she bas to do is to go on to the next
province. She can try one after another until
she finds one in which she is successful. It
may be said that this would not occur in
practice; but is it right that Parliament
should pass a law which would permit such a
state of things? I submit that the present
law is right and proper, and that there ought
not to be any change in this regard made in it.
There is just one other point. If the second
reading is carried, and the Bill goes to committee, I should like to see one change made
in the measure as now drawn. All the Bill
does is to substitute for the present section
2 of the Divorce Jurisdiction Act a new
section, in the drafting of which the old
section bas been taken (except in one respect),
and redrafted or rearranged. All its provisions
are repeated, with this change, which is of
course the important one, about selecting any
other province. The old section required that
at the time of bringing lier action for complete divorce the wife should still be residing
apart from her husband. All the other requirements as to desertion, separation and
living apart are repeated, and I cannot lelp
wondering why the draftsman of the proposed
amendment should have omitted this particular one. If the omission was intentional
and this requirement is not restored, it means
that after the desertion and living apart the
couple might come together again and that
the woman could, all the rest of ber life, hold
over the husband's head the threat of action,
because, although again living with him, she
would still preserve her right of action for
divorce.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I suggest that this debate might
be adjourned. I read the Bill pretty carefully, but I must admit that I missed one
feature to which attention bas been called by
the honourable senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth).
There is no
provision for two years' residence in the province in which it is contemplated the action
will be taken. I could not support the Bill
unless that defect were remedied. The objection of the honourable senator from North
York is, in my judgment, fatal.

MAY 20, 1941
His later point also seemns to have at least
enough miert to warrant inquiry. He contends
that in the absence of the specifications which
the old law provides it may be beld that, even
though the facts as to desertion applied, and
the spouses were living together again, the
right of action would continue. If such is the
case, that objection also would certainly be
fatal.
On the merits 1 do not feel quite as strongly
as the honourable gentleman from North York.
It seems to me that inasmuch as the Bill
provides that desertion is a condition precedent to the right of action, unless desertion
were establisbed the right of action in the other
province to whicb tbe woman goes would not
apply. If, further, there is a condition precedent of two years' residence, it is not
unreasonable ta say that a woman wb proves
sucb desertion and two years' residence should
not be asked to -return to the old province.
I call attention to tbis as well. I do not
tbink it is good practice to have in the
explanatory note anything more than an exposition of the, meaning of the new law as
contrasted with the law as it stood. The
present explanatory note seeks to advance an
argument on behaîf of thé%change. That is
not the true purpose of an explanatory note;
indeed, it is a prostitution of its purpose.
If the honourable senator from Westmor]and (Hon. Mr. Copp) is flot very strongly
urging the passing of the second reading
to.-night, I respectfully submit tbat it is not
too much ta ask that the Bill be flot given
second reading until an amendment so vital
is made.
Hon. A. B. COPP: I assure both of my
ho 'nourable friends that it is not my intention
ta press the Bill througb tbe House. Personally 1 arn not particularly interested in the
matter, but this idea of putting a woman
who bas been deserted on a par with the
husband bas been under discussion for a
number of years. As set out here, the present
law impo-ses a very great bardsbip upon a
woman who bas been deserted by beýr husband,
even thougb such desertion bas been proven.
Assuming that she originally belonged in the
province of British Columbia, and rnarried
a man fromn New Brunswick and made her
domicile tbere for a number of years, and
finally was deserted there by ber husband,
it migbt be that she would have ta return
to ber people in British Columbia or go there
to secure employment. I quite agree that
there sbould be a period of residence established. It seems ta me that is the only point
my honourable friend frorn North York (Hon.

153

Sir Allen Aylesworth) made. Undoubtedly
there should be a period of residence of one
or two years before she could bring the action.
1 feel that it would be a great hardship on
her to have to go to New Brunswick from
British Columbia simply because the husband
happened to be residing in the former province
when tbey were living as man and wife.
Through his desertion lie is the cause of her
beiog in the position she is in, and it seems
to me that she should be given the privilege
asked for in the Bill. I would agree to any
amendments to improve the Bill and make it
safe.
As I have said. 1 have personally no particular interest in the Bill. I brought it here
for the consideration of the House, and 1 arn
prepared to give it ail the attention I can
to work it out. I believe it would be in the
interest of the husband as well as the wifein fact, of ail concerned in such unfortunate
cases.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I want to join with the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) in asking
that the Bill be allowed to go to committee,
where we can discuss these amendments, and,
if we think it desirable, insert them in the
Bill. If you are not a large corporation lawyer,
but one of the ordinary run-of-mine lawyers,
you meet many people who are ini dilficulties
and you recognize that the present law
imposes a greater hardship on the woman
than it does on the man, because usually he is
earning the money. I agree with the bonourable gentleman from North York that there
should probably be a two-year residence
period.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In our province we frequently have cases in which the husband has
gone to Saskatchewan or Alberta, and in order
to secure relief the wife has to go to the
province in which the husband resides, and to
bring her witnesses with her.
We tbink we deal with quite a number of
divorces in the Senate, but I may tell you
that last year in Manitoba more than sixty
decrees were granted. Therefore divorce practice in law is fairly common.
I would suggest that the Bill be allowed to
go to committee so that these matters may be
ironed out. I do think we should put the
woman on an equal footing with the man,
because, -as anyone wbo bas sat on the Divorce
Committee knows. there are about five cases
in which the applicants are women to one in
which the applicant is a man. I think the

154

SENATE

best place to try these cases is a court, and
if we can give the women the same standing
as men, we should do it.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
after hearing the arguments advanced by the
honourable gentleman from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth) I doubt very much
whether we should rush this Bill through. It
is a very simple Bill, but there is a good deal
of law involved. As there will be a great many
people interested in it, I would suggest that
not only this House but also the people in
the country and the governments which may
be concerned should have time to consider
it. The Bill will reach committee in due
course, and we can have a discussion then.
A measure of this character should be carefully considered before its principle is adopted,
and I would urge that the suggestion made
by both the honourable senator from North
York and the right honourable leader on this
side of the House be carried out.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: 'Honourable
senators, since I first came into this House
I have made it a rule not to enter into any
discussion on the principle of divorce. I felt
that in regard to a matter respecting which I
could not say yes in approval, I was prevented from saying no. I desire to speak only
on the question of procedure and equity. If
a woman who has been deserted in one province, where she bas lived, is given the right
to take action in another province the day
after she arrives there, then the respondent,
if he wishes to defend himself, will have to
bring all his witnesses to the place of trial.
A number of months or years after the alleged
offence, one of the parties will be taken from
the jurisdiction of his own province and compelled to travel with his witnesses hundreds of
miles from the place where the offence was
supposed to have been committed. That, I
submit, is a point to be considered.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The same thing applies
to the woman. She is debarred from getting
a divorce because, by reason of ber husband's
desertion, she is not able to go to the province where he resides. If it is difficult for
a man to take his witnesses to the place where
his wife is residing, it is equally or more
difficult for the wife to take ber witnesses to
ber husband's province in order to prosecute
ber case there. I think this Bill puts the
man and the woman as nearly on a par as
possible in this matter. I do not wish to press
the Bill at all, but we are getting near the
end of the session, we hope, and I think the
Bill should at least go before committee, so
that we may receive a report and give it
consideration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I think the principle of this Bill
goes pretty far. Certainly from my point
of view the House would not be justified in
passing the principle with the idea that the
Bill might be anended in the committee.
Furthermore, I doubt very much whether the
amendment proposed meets the criticism
directed against the principle of the Bill.
The common law rule-it was, I know, the
rule in British Columbia until recently-was
that there was jurisdiction for divorce only
in the domicile of the husband. That was a
very drastic rule, and, I think, wrong. It
worked great hardships. A man might desert
his wife and acquire a new domicile, and the
wife would have to pursue ber relief in the
new domicile selected by the busband. That
bas been remedied. It is now proposed, to
carry the remedy to the other extreme-to
allow a wife's selection, not :of a domicile,
which is the legal wordi that all lawyers
understand in connection with divorce jurisdiction, but of mere residence, to be the
test of the court's jurisdiction to hear ber
action for divorce.
It seems to me this Bill proceeds on the
assumption that the husband is guilty and
that the wife who brings the action is innocent.
If that were always so, the Bill might be
justified. But experience tells us that sometimes actions are brought that are not justified or have not a proper foundation. One
must not overlook the fact that when a
woman brings an action for divorce on the
ground of adultery, another woman is involved
in the action, and ber honour may be at
stake, even more than tbat of the husband
and wife. She may be a married woman of
respectability, and with children, and it may
be highly essential that she defend the action,
wbich impugns ber honour and ber virtue.
I am not sure the two years' delay cures the
situation. It seems to me it only aggravates
it, since two years after an alleged incident
a respectable married woman may find berself a co-respondent in a divorce action before
a court two thousand miles away. I think this
legislation bas very serious implications, and
to my mind it cannot be cured by the proposed amendment.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Calder, the debate
was adjourned.

The Bill was read the first time.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl
this Bill be read a second time?
bonourbon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, I had intended saying a few
words on the general financial plan of the
Government in meeting the expenditure for
1941-42, but I thlnk we have already dis
cussed this matter, and I will postpone my
remarks until to-morrow.
With the leave of the bouse, I will move
that the Bill be now read a second time.

Right :Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: bonour-able members, this Bill, of course, wll
pass. There is no explanation offered anywhere, and I do not think any is really necessary, but I wonder if the leader of the bouse
can tell us ýwhy what would appear to he
excise taxes on brewed beer and malt liquor
are reduced. I do not want to be understood
as complaining. My point is that we do not
sec taxes reduced much now, and unless these
reductions are being made because of the
operation of the law of dirninishing returus,
they shýould be eliminated from the Bill.
There must be some reason, I suppose, and
I should like to know what it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If any honourable member desires to have clauses of this
Bill explained, I would ask hlm to state ls
questions now, so that I may he able to give
answers to them on the motion for third reading to-morrow.
Right bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The hionourable leader of the bouse will notice that
ail down the line, in section 8, there are
reductions. Oae opens one 's eyes now at anything la the nature of a tax reduction. The
other clauses of the Bill, I can see, are
Certain

functionaries la the tobacco industry are
eliminated.
bon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The right honourable gentleman is wrong in saying that taxes
are to be reduced. TIc new taxes la section 8,
on page 4, are increases in every case.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. The
former taxes are shown on the opposite page.
Well, that is more understandable. I could
not imagine what bad corne over the Government that it should propose to diminish taxes.
TIc motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
FIRST RtEADING

A message was rcceived from the bouse of
Commons with Bill 76, an Act to amend the
Customs Tariff.
The Bill was read the firat tirne.
SECOND READING

Thc bon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I rnove, with
tIc leave of the Senate, that the Bill be
read a second time now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the motion is
passed, I sîould like to ask the honourable

SENATE
leader whether the Bill as originally printed,
and in the form in which it reached us, has
not been changed in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has my honourable friend a recollection of any change having
been made?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I may bo wrong. I thought
some changes had been made. However, they
may not be in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If second reading is given now, I shall make inquiry and
have an answer for the honourable senator
to-morrow.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I want to say a word as to
one feature of this Bill, sn that the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
may be ready with an answer to-morrow, on
the motion for third reading. For the life of
me I cannot understand why reductions are
at this time made on certain articles in the
tariff schedule. I cannot be wrong, for I see
item 410d is now free in all three classes, and
there cannot be any further reduction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cover?

What does it

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It covers
"Well-drilling m'achinery and apparatus, and
complete parts thereof, for use exclusively in
drilling for water, natural gas or oil, or in
prospecting for minerals." In ordinary times
argument could be made for the putting of
this item on the frec list, but that argument
has never before prevailed, however desirable
such action may have been from one or more
standpoints. The argument has not been
considered sufficient. How can it be sufficient
now? This Government-quite properly, in
my judgment-forbade importation of many
things, even tbough considerable enhancement
might accrue to the revenue. There is a
long list of forbidden articles, many of them
most useful, and some that I think should not
be excluded.
Why was their importation
forbidden? In order that we might the better
preserve our exchange position by not purchasing too much American exchange, which is
needed for other purposes. Reasons which in
other years might have been, but were not,
considered convincing enough for putting that
class of goods on the free list should surely
not be deemed to be convincing now, for undoubtedly our exchange position will be adversely affected all the more if those goods are
exempted from tariff duties.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The Western Provinces
want to develop their cil resources, and in
order to do so they need to bring in this class
of machinery free.
lon. Mr. HAIG.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
argument my honourable friend might have
advanced in other years. But it was not
considered good enough then, when the
reasons for removing the duty were much
more powerful. How can the same argument
be good enough now? This is something I
cannot follow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There
still
lingers in my mind the statement by the
Minister of Finance that he was not resisting
pressure from the Western Provinces, which
were trying to develop their oil production,
and that be was giving them this advantage
because it would be in the public interest and
belp in the carrying on of the war.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The force
of that argument I quite admit. Though it
may not be quite as strong in my mind as it
would be in other minds, yet there is a great
deal of convincing character to it. But that
character was just as much inherent in the
argument ten, five, or two years ago, as it is
to-day. The argument did not prevail then.
To-day you can set against it a most formidable case, namely, that we want to conserve
Canadian exchange. We are going to extremes
in other lines in order to do so. With the
balance of argument very much stronger
against exemption to-day than it was at that
time, I cannot but express surprise that exemption is granted. It applies not only to this
item, but also to others. I take this
item merely as ah instance. There may be
reasons which would convince me of the
desirability of this change, but I have not
read them, and if such reasons exist I should
like to have them given to the House.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It seems to me that
my right honourable friend's argument defeats
itself. He bases his objection on the fact
that, if this machinery comes into Canada,
money will have to be sent out, and this will
be to the detriment of American exchange.
Is it not just possible-I think it is quite
probable-that if you permit this machinery
to come in, even though it necessitates the
use of a certain amount of American exchange,
the result will be that there will be produced
in Canada a quantity of oil which otherwise
would have to be imported from the United
States? I should think the exchange would
be offset in that way.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There may
be something in tbat argument, but it would
have applied previously just as much as now,
and I doubt very much whether we are going
to affect the importation. I think the real
result will be a reduction in revenue.

MAY 27, 1941
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
EXCESS PROFITS TAX BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 78, an Act to amend the
Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With leave of
the Senate, I' move second reading of the
Bill now.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: 'Honourable senators, I have read this Bill and
the debate on it with some care, and I have
pleasure in saying I think this measure very
much improves the present Act in many
respects. The House will recall that when
the Act was before us a year ago certain
members of this Chamber called attention to
the unworkability of the referee clauses, and
predicted that, if the task imposed on the
board was to be discharged, that body would
have as big a job as that of the Government
itself-that it was impossible to discharge
such a task. This Bill very much contracts
the burden on the back of the referee board.
I think that there will have to be still
further lightening and simplification, but this
Bill goes a long way, and the burden will not
be more than a fraction of what it was. A
company which claims, under either one of
two clauses, to be entitled to relief has to
set down its reasons, and then it has to state
what its standard should be, the standard of
the previous four years not being possible of
application. As a result of the existing law,
a company which had had all sorts of trouble
or happened to be in an industry which had
been depressed, struggling and driving against
troubles requiring years to surmount, was
penalized for its own distress. It was punished
by an excess profits tax because, through its
own efforts, it got out of its difficulties.
Having effected economies and done everything an efficient company could do, it was
made to pay two, three or four times as much
as a company which all through the years had
had a fair measure of success. Such a result,
of course, was indefensible.
The present measure removes much of the
objection and also relieves the board of
referees.
The company makes its own
estimate, and if the Minister feels it is an
improper one, he can refer the whole matter,
together with the reasons, to the board, who

157

will have an opportunity of adopting standards and principles.
Thus principles will
emerge which would never have emerged from
the previous system. I think the Bill is a
great improvement
in that respect, as
well as in the fact that it gives some little
relief to a company which for four years
previously had perhaps the worst possible
conditions to survive. The company now
gets at least this relief, that if one of those
years is bad beyond compare it can be
eliminated from the standard period. A
similar provision has been in the British Act
all along.
There is a remarkable misunderstanding
when it comes to a comparison of the excess
profits taxes and the corporation taxes of the
two countries. There is a general acceptance
here of the idea that in Britain there is a
tax of one hundred per cent, and that we,
with a seventy-five per cent tax, pay much
less. Such is not the case at all. The methods
of computing excess profits are vastly different. I would rather have the tax of
one hundred per cent as it is computed
in Britain than our seventy-five per cent tax
as we compute it.
There is another feature. The principle
behind the British law is much the better.
In taxing excess profits the British authorities
go to the corporation, it is truc, but in
estimating the tax the corporation is to pay
they lay down the principle in such a way as
to be fairly confident that those excess profits
are due to the war. Their main tax-one
might almost say, up to the line of the excess
profits tax, their only one-is not against the
corporation, which is the instrument whereby
the work of the country is donc and the
earnings are made, but against the individual
who draws from the corporation. They have
not a system of taxation such as we have
had. We have had a tax of five per cent,
then ten, then twel've and a half. Those taxes
were heavy enough, but when the rate gets
up to twenty or thirty per cent it is terrifie.
Only one coricerned in these matters can
realize what it means. The British authorities
get just as much in taxes as we do; more
indeed; but instead of going to the corporation, they go to the people who own it.
The instrument which produces the wealth is
left free and is encouraged; but when it
pays dividends to its stockholders they have
to pay. By a corporation being left comparatively free the stockholders get more,
and tihe State gets more, and the tax is
more equitable, because then it is in proportion to the ability ta pay. There is no double
tax, no discriminatory tax. When you go to
the instrument which makes the wealth and

SENATE

158

tax it, instead of going to the person who receives and enjoys the wealth, you get into difficulties all the time.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: How does that work
out in connection with foreign shareholders?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was intending to come to that. The difficulty the honourable senator mentions is very great; and
there is another one-that a corporation
may hoard and not pay out; but the situation
is covered in both cases. I am not just sure
how it is donc in Britain, but I can see how
it could be donc. A corporation could be
penalized for laying aside reserve and not
paying out. I am not saying that in such an
instance a corporation would not be acting in accordance with the best business principle, or from patriotic motives. Perhaps it
should have reserves against some future day,
or some contingency it can readily sec. However, if it has them, a tax can be put upon
them. I do not know of any other way in
which the undue hoarding of earnings can be
prevented, and certainly it must be prevented if you are to go to the shareholder
instead of to the corporation.
As to the foreigner, undoubtedly a heavier
tax is involved; but I do not sympathize very
much with those in other lands who howl
against paying Dominion taxes in respect of
interest and dividends on our securities. They
have to take their chances with the nation
when they invest here, and the taxes they
pay go towards the preservation of the very
securities they have. If the war is not won,
what becomes of their securities? By studying
the methods adopted in 'Great Britain to meet
that very situation we could gain much. I
shall not presume to state them now.
All I rose to say was this: I think the
British principle is right, of encouraging the
instrument that does the work and makes
the money, and of getting at those who receive
If you strike at the instruthe money.
ment itself and levy very heavy taxes on it,
and afterwards on the recipients, you do not
get any more money. You can tax incomes
to the utmost, and nobody can complain so
long as he can live. You will get the
nation's work done better if you do not
strangle the instrument which operates to
produce the nation's wealth.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

never think of defeating it, or of amending it

in conflict with the decision of the House of
Commons and the Administration; but I can
see that we might be of assistance if we
studied this Bill in detail in committee. I
like the Bill in more particulars than I have
mentioned. I recall that certain features which
appear in this Bill were reviewed by our
Banking and Commerce Committee when some
submission was before it-I fancy it must have
been the existing Act-and officers of the
department argued with the members of the
committee as to the need of amendments;
two of which, as urged by the committee,
now appear in this measure. It bas occurred
to me that we might be of a little assistance
again. I do not believe in our amending a
money bill without the acquiescence of the
Administration, but I do not sec any harm in
the growth of a body of doctrine which admits
of amendment in the Senate, provided such
amendment does not in any way bring the
Senate into conflict with the Commons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I understand
my right honourable friend correctly, he desires
that this Bill be sent to the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could he indicate one or two questions upon which he
would like some enlightenment at that
committee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, not with
regard to this Bill. On the whole, I like this
Bill very much, and consider it a great
improvement on the present law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a good
reason for taking third reading now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A meeting of
the committee would give us an opportunity
for discussion, with one or two very competent
officials, on the merits of the principle I have
been seeking to expound here to-night and
have sought to expound at other times, though
perhaps not as directly.
That favours
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the British system of taxing the shareholders
and not the corporation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
sooner we get to it the better.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would involve
a transformation of our fiscal economy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, no
transformation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to our sending the Bill to the Banking
and Commerce Committee. The committee
would meet to-morrow morning, I suppose?

may hauve been unable te earn a living and

MAY 28, 1941
have had to go for maintenance to her childhood home, or the home of some other member of ber family. Assuming for the sake of
argument that she was deserted by ber busband in New Brunswick, that the desertion
left her virtually penniless, and that for one
reason or another she has taken up residence
in British Columbia. The Bill does not specify
what minimum period of residence would
qualify ber to enter action for divorce in the
province where she makes ber new home; but
naturally a period of one or two years would
be necessary. If the Bill were amended
accordingly, the deserted wife could, after
the required period of residence in British
Columbia, bring action against ber husband,
who lives in New Brunswick. Under the
present law she would be obliged to travel all
the way to New Brunswick to institute proceedings, because the courts of British
Columbia would have no jurisdiction to hear
her case. That would work a great hardship
to any woman who .found herself in such a
position.
My honourable friend' from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said the other day
that passage of this Bill could cause injustice,
because two years after an alleged incident a
reputable woman might be named as corespondent in a divorce action before a court
two thousand miles away. That is possible,
but not very probable, for I believe I am
safe in saying that in 98 or 99 per cent of the
cases that come before us the co-respondent is
unknown. However, I am prepared to admit
that the possibility does exist, and that it is
an unfortunate one. On the other band, as
the law now stands, a husband living two
thousand miles away from his wife may take
action for divorce and make it necessary for
his wife to travel that distance to defend ber
honour and reputation.
All that this Bill attempts to do is to put
the wife as nearly as possible on a par with
the husband so far as the right to apply for
divorce is concerned. As I said before, I
am not pressing the matter unduly. I should
like to see the Bill given second reading and
referred for consideration to whatever may
be deemed the proper committee. There it
could be modified by as many amendments
as were thought necessary to give both husband and wife a fair deal in the matter of
making application for divorce. It always
seems unfortunate that a married couple
should decide to apply for a divorce, but we
have to recognize the fact that such unfortunate developments do arise, and we should
make provision for dealing with thern as
fairly as possible to all parties concerned.
The present Bill simply seeks to remedy a
situation that has been unfair to the woman

in many a case, because she has been put to
far more expense than her husband would
have been put to in applying for a divorce in
similar circumstances.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I am glad the debate on the
motion for second reading of this Bill was
adjourned last week. It seemed to me that
the Bill in its present form should not pass
in face of the very formidable objection
raised by the honourable senator frorn North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) and the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris). I understand that the sponsor
of the Bill (Hon. Mr. Copp) is now prepared
to accept an amendment providing two years'
residence as a necessary prerequisite to institution of a divorce action by a woman in the
province where she makes her new home
after being deserted. On the understanding
that such amendment will be acceptable to
him, if 'to the committee, I am agreeable to
second reading.
I approached the whole subject in an attitude of sympathy with the measure, and I
cannot say that that attitude has been
wholly changed by the discussion. However,
representations have been made to me regarding actual instances where specific hardship
would be created by the Bill. Naturally, and
perhaps logically, the sponsor of the Bill proceeds on the assumption that generally, at
least, the fault in cases covered by the measure
is on the part of the husband. Well, a case
brought to my attention presents-if the facts
are as outlined-an entirely different state of
circumstances. I can see where very serious
hardship could arise under this Bill, because
a woman's right virtually to sue her husband
and have damages of reputation assessed
against him may be exercised far from his
home, at a place where he could not defend
himself without going to great expense and
inconvenience. That might happen in only
a small minority of cases. At any rate, it
could happen in some cases.
I have a thought in mind. Perhaps it would
be better to present it in committee, but I
may not be a member of the committee.
It is this. The woman might be given the
right to enter a petition in the province of

onus would be on her to establish such facts

husband or someone acting on his behalf.
It seems to me it would be quite practicable
to provide precautions whereby a woman
whose real object was to get away from her
husband would be prevented from doing a
gross and irreparable injustice to him by
merely exercising her right under the Bill.
This suggestion may be somewhat onerous to
work out, but I do not think it ought to be,
and I submit it for what consideration the
committee may think it deserves.
If the amendment which I have already
mentioned is acceptable to the sponsor, I am
quite ready to support second reading of the
Bill, on the understanding that there will be
a reference to committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it is moved by Hon. Senator Copp,
seconded by Hon. Senator Murdock, that
Bill N2, an Act to amend the Divorce Jurisdiction Act, 1930, be now read the second
time. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?

afternoon, and the Senate does not meet until
Monday night, the committee could hardly
be called together before then.
Hon. Mr. COPP: It would suit me to have
a committee meeting this afternoon, if we can
get the members together. I should like to
take' advantage of this opportunity to ask
members of the Private Bills Committee to
meet after the Senate rises, say at 4 o'clock.
I move that the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills be given permission to sit this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps the
committee could sit to hear the witness who
has been mentioned as being present in
Ottawa to-day, and could then adjourn until
Monday.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, I
move that the Bill be referred to a committee.
I do not know which is the proper committee,
whether the Committee on Private Bills or on
Divorce. Perhaps it would be better to send
it to the Private Bills Committee.
The motion to refer the Bill to the Standing
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills
was agreed to, on division.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would it be
possible for the committee to meet this afterI understand adjournment of the

There happens to be an interested party in
town, and it would be a convenience to him
to be able to make representations before the

PRIVATE BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that a message had been received from
the House of Commons returning Bill B2, an
Act respecting British Columbia Telephone
Company, with several amendments, to which
they desired concurrence of the Senate.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
this Bill as amended was placed in my hands
only this evening. The honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris),
who introduced the measure, is not here, and
I think it would be well to refer it to our
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours for consideration of the amendments. I may say that the company asked
for an increase of capital from $10,000,000 to
$20,000,000.
In the Bill as amended the
capitalization is reduced to $11,000,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is it the
increase asked for or the total capital that
is reduced?
It

Hon. Mr. KING: The increase asked for.
was argued in the other Chamber that

JUNE 2, 1941
during war-time the company should not ask
for so large an increase in capital, and the
$10,000,000 asked for was reduced to $1,000,000,
which would make the new capitalization
$11,000,000. That is the important provision
of the Bill. In the absence of the honourable
senator from Vancouver South, I move that
the Order be discharged and placed on the
Order Paper for to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to.
PENSION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 17, an Act to amend the
Pension Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have asked the
Hon. Dr. King, who has been Minister of
Pensions, kindly to take charge of this Bill.
Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of the BillHe said: Honourable senators, I have given
considerable time and thought to the legislation which is now before us. The Pension Act
was passed by the Canadian Parliament in
1919 and has been amended from time to
time.
When important amendments to
pension legislation have been deemed desirable
it has been the praetice for a committee of the
House of Commons to investigate the changes
suggested and hear evidence in regard to
them. In 1936 the opinion prevailed that the
Canadian Government and the people of this
country, through their Parliament, had done
very well in pension matters, and that the
pension law of Canada was as liberal as, and
in advance of, that of most of the countries
which had been engaged in the Great War.
When war came again in 1939, the Gôvernment was faced with the problem of applying
our pension legislation to present-day conditions, and provision was made accordingly,
from time to time, by Order in Council. The
Government found many difficulties in the
way, as the set-up of this war was different
from that of the last war. In the previous
conflict we had what was known as an expeditionary force, composed of men who had
enhisted, and those men came under the
pension law of that time. In this war there
has been a great increase in the number of
men engaged in the Navy and in the Air
Force. They do not undergo the ordinary
•

14879-114

163

form of military tràining, but are trained in
institutions.

The Minister asked a committee

of his department to indicate what Orders in
Council should be passed and become effective.
The purpose of the Bill submitted to Parliament this year was to bring into line and
cover pensionable conditions as they exist at
the present day. This Bill, introduced in the
House of Commons, was referred by that
House to a special committee of some forty
members. I think it was a well selected
committee. I had the pleasure of attending
some of its sittings, and I may say the discussion was general and fair. The committee
enlarged upon and went much beyond the
Bill as originally proposed, and perhaps I
may indicate the amendments suggested by
the committee and now incorporated in the
Bill.
These results of the committee's
deliberations have greatly broadened the
scope of the Act.
The amendments may be divided into five
groups.
The first group extends the basis of eligibility for pensions.
The second group eliminates a date which
was set as a barrier to the award of pensions
to men who have married since the last war.
The date was advanced from time to time
until 1936; then it was settled that the wife
and children of a man who married after
that year should not be eligible for pension. That dead-line has been extended by
this Bill to 1942. In so far as the present
war is concerned, the Bill sets no date as a
dead-line, the committee having felt that this
would have to be fixed from time to time as
the authorities might consider advisable.
The third group has to do with a subject
that has caused much worry and been of
great interest to pension authorities in Canada.
It widens the benefit for men serving in the
Imperial forces. I think all honourable members realize that many men who went over
and joined the Imperial forces in the last war
found great difficulty afterwards in bringing
themselves within our Pensions Act. This
Bill makes provision for as far back, I think,
as four years prior to the present war, to
include men who went to Britain and became
incorporated with the Imperial forces by joining the Royal Air Force or the Navy. They
are now made pensionable.
The fourth group deals with very specialized
provisions, all of which have been made less
restrictive than they are in the present Act.
The fifth group consists merely of administrative amendments.
I would suggest, with the consent of the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.

SENATE

164

Dandurand), that the Bill be referred to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. There
we should have an opportunity of learning
from departmental officials and other persons
familiar with pension matters the need for
passing these amendments.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the Bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

JUNE 2, 1941

more in form than in matter. I would suggest to honourable members that they direct
their attention to the Bill as passed by the
Bouse of Commons last Friday rather than to
the measure as it reached us on first reading.
The explanatory notes are as follows:
The purpose of this Bill is to provide a
Dominion Act in aid of provincial game legislation which will prohibit shipments of game
out of a province without proper provincial
authorization and which by virtue of its being
a Dominion law could be applied in any part
of Canada with respect to any province. This
involves an exercise of the Dominion's jurisdietien in respect of export either from Canada or
from one province to another, a subject not
within provincial jurisdiction.
The administration of wild life resources rests
with provincial and territorial authorities,
except that the Dominion Government, under
the Migratory Birds Convention Act, makes
and enforces regulations for the protection of
migratory birds in fulfilment of its obligations
under the Migratory Birds Treaty with the
United States. All provinces and territories
have enacted laws protecting wild ,life, thus
carrying out their administrative responsibilities. It has been possible, however, for a
person to violate provincial game laws and avoid
payment of provincial royalties by removing the
game or fur in his possession to another province. The result bas been that the purpose
of provincial laws protecting wild life is being
defeated, and the provinces are being deprived
of royalties due to them.
That is the sense of the Bill.
With the leave of the House I would read
the statement made by the Minister of Mines
and Resources when he introduced this Bill.
As honourable members are aware, the control
of game, the licensing of hunters, permits to
trap, and everything relating to the taking of
fur-bearing or other wild animals, are wholly
in the jurisdiction of the provinces within their
respective boundaries. A province can take
necessary steps to conserve fur-bearing animals
within its own boundaries; that is, it can
require a trapper to take out a licence to trap,
to make a return of his take, and to give any
other particulars that the provincial authorities
may require of him. The same thing holds truc
with regard to the shooting of big game, in
fact, the taking of any sort of wild animal
for any purpose whatsoever.
A rather serious difficulty bas, however,
arisen in this respect. Frequently wild animals
are illegally taken within a province. A province may declare a closed season for a period
of time against the trapping or taking of beaver,
for example; because, while beaver in large
areas have almost disappeared, in our western
provinces particularly, and also in the eastern
provinces, there was a time in the history of
this country when skins taken from beaver
constituted a very large part of the total commerce in furs. A province may declare a closed
season on beaver, and under those conditions it
is illegal for anyone to trap or take beaver
within that province. As frequently happens,
however, some trapper who does net take out
a licence, illegally and against the laws of the
province traps beaver within the province and
has the pelts or skins for sale. He cannot
sell them within the province, because, if he
attempts to sell within the province, he must

produce his licence or permit, and since none
was issued to him he is in difficulties. But
he will take these pelts or skins across the
boundary into another province, and there is
nothing in the laws of the second province that
prohibits him from making a sale and putting
the proceeds into his pocket. The purpose 0f
this Bill is te overcome that defect, and it is
sought to overcome it by means of proclamation
in provinces "where it is necessary-and eight
out of the nine provinces have asked for it.
Then it will be necessary, before the trapper
who has taken skins illegally in Saskatchewan,
for instance, can sell them in Manitoba, to
produce a licence or permit to take them in
Saskatchewan. If he is unable to produce a
licence or permit showing that he bas taken
them legally, he is in difficulties in the province
in which he tries to sell them. The furs can
be seized and he can be charged and fined, or,
if ho failes to pay the fine. imprisoned. That,
as simply as I can state it, is the purpose of
the legislation.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. COTE: May I ask a question of
the Government leader? I understood him
to say that the Bill did not go to the Commons in the form in which it appears before
us now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was referring
not to the Bill as now before us, but to the
Bill as introduced in the House of Commons.
Considerable discussion took place there of
various aspects, and several amendments were
made to the Bill as introduced, in the
Commons.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It may be a matter of
detail, but I notice that under section 8
a justice of the peace may issue a warrant
to enable a constable to search for game in
a warehouse, dwelling-house, or any other
place. This warrant may be given to a constable, which is quite proper, but the section
goes on to . say "or other person," which
seems not quite so proper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that?

What section is

Hon. Mr. COTE: Clause 8; "or other
person." That is a very general and wide
provision. I do not think a search warrant
should be given to any person who is not a
police officer, even if the choice of the person
is left to the discretion of the justice of the
peace, because the search may be made not
only in the day-time, but at night as well.
I am wondering whether that is one of the
sections which have been amended. I do not
think it should go through in its present form.
I remember that last session or the session
before, in connectioh with a similar law
affecting the collection of duties and rates
on furs transported from one of the western
provinces to a place in another part of Canada,
we referred a bill to a standing committee

SENATE
in order to provide an essentiai guarantee
against the abuse of the search warrant. 1
may be wrong, but it is my recoliection that
in the case of a search warrant authorizing a
search in a dwelling-house at night, we providced that two constables should do the
searcbing. According to this Bili, one person
who is not a consta-ble, and who may not be
at ail accustomed to this kind of work, wouid
be allowed, under a search warrant issued
by a justice of the peace, to break into the
bouse of a peaceful citizen during the hours
of slumber, and this is flot quite in accordance
with usage under the crirninai law of this
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
the House of Commonis amended this measure
in order to ensure proper autbority being
given te the party baviog in hand the warrant.
The Minister, in referring to section 8, said:
When this section was under consideration
before, it was suggested that before proceedings
w'ere takzen an information sbouid be laid, hI
order to nicet this objection I shall asic my
coileague to inove that section 8 be amendcd
by addinig after the word "satisfied" in the
first linc thercof the words "by information."
This amendinent was carried 'unanimously.
having been approved by those who had
previously takeýn exception to clause 8.
Hlon. Mr. COTE: It is a very good
provision that the justice of the peace shahl
receive bis know iedge froin sworn information, but that does not at ail meet the objection I have made. Antherization for the
search of a dwelling-house at night shouid be
given to a police officer, or, better stili, two
constables. I arn reýferring, not to a warebouse, but to a dweiling-house.
Hon.
Mr. DANDURAND:
I wonder
whether my hionourabie friend bas read
clause 6:
Officcîrs appoinited under the gaine a1w s of
any province, members of the Roy ai Canadian
3kounitcd Police anti of the police for-ce of any
province, and officers; of custeins shall bcecx
officio gaine officers and as such în.îy excrcise
the powers and carry ont tue duties bv this
Act given to or imposed uponi gaine officers and
for the purposes of this Act andi witlim
the
territory in respect of ichel the~ li office
shail1 have ail the powers of a pea(e lofi cer or
a police constable.
Hon. Mr. COTE: That defines an efficer,
but the word "officer" is not used in clause 8;
it says "some constable or other person."
The other person may not be an officer.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It shonid be "other
person having the authority of a police officer."
Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest that
this Biii go to committee. It seins to me
Hasi. Mr. COTÉ.

the point taken by the honourabie senator
(Mon. Mr. Coté) is very sound, and that the
difficulty could be easiiy remedied.
I have ýanother difficuity. On page 3, in
section 12 of the Bill, it is provided that when
the Biii becuinci an Act it may be cailed
into effeet by the provinces. My mind is
confused as to what is going to be the resuit.
For example, Manitoba may ask to bave the
iaw go into effeet in that province, and a
proclamation wili be issued accordingiy. Now
look at the principal section of the Bill,
section 3. It says:
No person shahl knowingiy,
(a) take, carry, send, ship, or bave iii
posséssien for the purpose of talziag, carrying,
sending or shipping or receive for shîipinent or
transmission heyond the limits of the province
within which such gaine xras kiilld any gaine
except under the authority of an export permit
duly issued under the laws of such province.
I think it is fairly clear-though not too
clear-that in se far as Manitoba is concerned
any person couid "take, carry, send, ship, or
have in possession for the purpose of taking,
carrying, sending or shippîng," if he got outside of Manitoba and the measure were in
force in that province only. My main difficnity, howex or, is to be found in tEe application of subelause (b), whichi snys:

If this laxv is caiicd into effect by Manitoba,

JUNE 2, 1941

The one thing I do like about the Bill is
that it does legislate. It does not authorize the
Governor in Council to legislate and to tell
us later what he has done.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is quite clear
that this Bill seeks to protect the jurisdiction
and, autonomy of the province, and that the
Dominion's intention is to act only when a
province needs federal support in having its
own regulations respected in another province.
I have no objection to sending the Bill to a
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill is to
be sent to a committee, but I do not know
what oommittee it should be.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Why not the Committee
on Agriculture? This Bill has just as much to
do with agriculture as it has with banking
and commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. It bas to
do with resources, but not agriculture.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Chairman
of the Committee on Agriculture (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly) is not here. I think the Bill should
go to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When we are not
certain to what committee a bill should be
referred, we say the Banking and Commerce
Committee. So I move that it go to that
committee.
The motion was agreed to.
INDIAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 24, an Act to amend the
Indian Act.
Right Hon. Mr.
hensive that the
House (Hon. Mr.
this, because it is

MEIGHEN: I am apprehonourable leader of the
Dandurand) cannot explain
not a bill at all.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Very likely
what my right honourable friend resents is
the power this Bill gives to the Governor in
Council.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is not
a bill. It is just an authorization to the
Governor in Council to legislate. He is empowered to prohibit or regulate or do what
lie pleases about the buying of wild animals
Evidently it is
and skins from Indians.

167

taken for granted that Parliament does not
know what he ought to do. The Bill assumes
that we know nothing about the subject, and
asks us in our ignorance to be kind enough to
empower the Governor in Council, when he
gets to know something about it, to dô
something.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
At all events,
I will try to explain the Bill. The explanatory
notes say this:
Sections 40 and 41 of the Indian Act prohibit
the buying or acquiring from any band or
irregudar band of Indians or from any Indian
of any cattle, other animals, grain, root crops
or other produce on reserves in the provinces
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta, or the
Northwest Territories without the written consent of the Indian Agent where disposal is to
be made to any person other than an Indian
of the band, and these sections prohibit any
Indian from selling the same to other than a
member of the band without a similar consent.
Section 45 of the Indian Act controls the
bartering with Indiens on reserves as aforesaid. These provisions were brought into the
Indian Act in 1881, 1882 and 1890 respectively
and were restricted to the reserves in the said
provinces by reason of the fact that farming
operations at that time were confined largely to
Western Canada.
There is no provision in the Indian Act at
present whereby any control is exercised over
the trading in fur with Indians on or off
reserves. The lack of such control bas resulted
in unfair dealings with the Indians in this
regard. It is, therefore, proposed to give the
Governor in Council authority to make regulations prohibiting and controlling the buying
or otherwise acquiring from any Indien any
wild animal or the skin or other part of such
animal, both on or off reserves, in areas throughout the Dominion where circumstances so warIn such areas the regulations will
rant.
authorize the granting of yearly permits to
persons to trade with Indiens upon such terms
and conditions as may be considered necessary.
This explanation was enlarged as follows
by the Minister of Mines and Resources
when he introduced the Bill in another place:
It is intended to provide a measure of protection to Indians in the more remote parts
of the country in the sale of their fur catch.
Practices have developed, particularly in recent
years, whereby traders, often more or less
unscrupulous in character, journey to the
remoter reserves, usually by aeroplane, at the
time the Indiens have their fur for sale. The
Indian is not fully aware of the value of his
fur, and the result is that often lie disposes of
it at prices very much below what it is worth.
It is sought by this measure to bring such
trading under proper control, by providing that
the Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the Indian Affairs Administration,
create regulations which shall cover such traders,
and under the regulations permits to trade will
be provided before such traders can go to these
remote reserves and do their bargaining with
the Indians. It is intended further, that the
regulations shall provide that traders shall make
a report to the Indian Affairs Administration
of the furs they purchase and of the price they

168

SENATE

have paicl for tlîem. In that way we can bring
about a measure of control whieh to-day is
very baly needed.
The importance of thie measure will be
apparent to the committee when 1 say that
practically one-third of the Indian population
of Canada, which now numbers approximately
118,000 or 119,000, lives in the more remot e
parts of the varjous provinces, particularly
Quehee,
Ontario,
Manitoba,
Saskatchewan,
Alberta and British Columbia, and in the
Northwe.st Territorjes. These Indians have no
means of subsistence other than their fur catch.
It is consequently to them, andl 1 might add
to the Goverument, a matter of great importance,
that as far as possible they shall secure the full
value of their fur catch.

iug for detailed application by Order in
Council.
That is uecessarily dune in most
important
legislation.
But nu
principle
whatever is laid down here.
Under this
measure we simply throw our hands; helplessly
in the air and say: "Sometbing needs toi be
dune. But, Heaven help us, we do nut know
what it is. Therefore, we ask the Governor
in Council to think the subjeet out, and toi do
what tu him seems meet and just."~
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Thore may be a
number of reasons why it sbould be dune this
way.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, for years we have had a lot of this
kind of alleged legislation, but neyer have I
seen an instance where a concoction of words
described as a bill was such a moustrous
perversion of language.as is this. This is not
a bill at ahi. ýIt legislates uotbing. It provides
that the Governor in Council may legishate
to prohibit and to regulate. How hie will
botb prohibit and regulate. I do not know.
Once a trade is prohibited, there is flot mucb
left to regulate. However, this empowers the
Governor in Council botb to prohbit sud to
regulate in any way bie desires. And we cali
this a b ill! Then we go on to say that
we will provide now a penalty to be inllicted
upon any unhappy individual wbo violates a
law you may make some day, a law about
wbose provisions we have not the Ieast idea.
The explauatory note tells us what the
present law is. It says that trade witb Indians
is restrained and the Indian protected chiefly
by provisions in section 45 of the Act wbich
were enacted in 1881, 1882 and 1890. Honourable mem-bers will observe that those
provisions were not made by Order in
Council; they were passed by Parliament.
The members of the Parliament of those days
decided what protection should be afforded the
Indian; but we are regarded as a mass of
senility and helplessness, and in our belplessness we are calied upon to authorize the
Governor in Council to make wbatever law
he deems necessary. 1 intend to oppose this
measure, as it is an insuit to the Senate and
was an insult to the Communs.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: There is nu
reason; there cannot be any.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before this Bill
is put toi a vote I will ask that the debate
be adjourued, in order that I may have an
opportunity of looking into the Acts of
1932-33 and 1934, which were passed by the
Administration of my right bonourable friend.
I may find that Orders in Council were not s
abhorrent to him then as they are to-day.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Wben the
prînciples of the law are laid down in a
measure, there is nothing wrong with providMon. Mr. DANDURAND.

H-on. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bihl covers
trade with Indians in three western provinces
and the Nortbwest Territories, and it may be
that different regulations are made necessary
by varying geographical conditions. As I have
flot looked into this point, I know uothing
about it. An adjournment of the debate
would give me an opportunity to learn wby it
is desired toi empower the Governor in
Council to make regulations for probibiting
and controlling this trade. The Bill clearly
sets out this principle: thnt the Governor in
Council may act for certain purposes and
wit."hin certain limitations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
principle? It is the need of sume law.
Honi. Mr. DANDURAND: The prineiple is
that
The Governo>r in Council m.ay makze regulations to prohibit and control the huyiug or
otherwise acquiring from any Indien, no>n-treiaty
Indian or band or -irregular band of Indiana
any wild animal o-r -the skin or other part of
such animal. Without restricting the generality
of the foregoýing the regulations may prescribe:(a) That the Superin-tendent General or
Agent -acting on his beh-aîf may issue permits
-to buy or otherwise acquire any wild anima]
or parts thereo-f as aforesaid and may fix the
terms upon which such permits may he issued;
(b) That a fine not exceeding five hundred
dollars or imprisonmoent for a termi not exceeding six montha or both fine and imprisonmieut
may be imposed for 'any violation of sueh
regulations.
Where the Superintendent General or Agent
acting on bis behaîf, bas reason to believe that
the regulations have been eoutravened in respect
of .any wild animal or the skin or other part of
such animal hae may seize sncb animal or any
part or parts thereof wherever found and
hring the samne hefore any judge, police or
&tipendiary magistrate, two justices of the peýace
or Indian Agent and on proof that such contravention has o-ocurred sueh animal or part or
parts shahl be de-clared forfeited to His Majesty.
Any animal or part thereof declared forfeited
hereunder shaîl be disposed of as the Superintendent General may direct.
AhI] this would be in the statute.

JUNE 2, 1941
Riglit Hon. Mr. MBIGHEN: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -and my right
hanourabie friend would think it splendid
legislatian. But becauise the Bill defines the
jurisdièction of the Gavernor in Council,
and states how by autharization ta the Superintendent Generai, or Agent acting an bis
bebaif, certain tbings shall be done, my right
honourable friend is scandaiized. Lately be
bas affirmed the autbority of Parliament as
against delegation of power ta the Governar
ini Council. But that delegation of power
ta the Governar in Council cornes from Parliament itself, and when the two branches of
Parliament have delegated such power, the
Governor in Council is clatbed with ail the
authority of Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly be
is deiegated. But my argument is, be should
net be delegated with authority ta lay down
the uines of the law; that is ail. The bonaurable gentleman says the Gavernor in Council is restricted here. He is nat restricted
by a single sentence. ýHis hands- are not tied
at ail. He can make any regulation he likes
in order ta contrai this trading, or ta prohibit
it entirely if in bis wisdom be tbinks it
better ta do so. We have no part in those
regulations; when passed tbey will be published in the Canada Gazette, but will not
appear in a statute. The first law, relating ta
domestic animais and farm products, passed
by Parliament in the regular way, is ta be
found. in the statutes, wbere ail may read it;
but when it cames ta furs, we bave a Parliament se heipless that it is asked ta let the
Gavernment of Canada have carte blanche.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Very likely my
right hanourable friend proceeded in this way
dozens of times when be sat in my seat.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: No, I do not
think be will find I did so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know men
who roared tbroughout the length and breadtb
of this country against the very borror of
Orders in Council, but neyer did I. Orders
in Council ini their place are right and proper.
But Orders in Council can neyer take the
place of broad lines of legislation. Tbey must
graw out of legislation and give effect ta the
intent which is specifically laid down.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is done
now by this Bill.
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, there is
not a single principie laid down in legisiation;
not one item; there is anly authority given
ta someone ta take action.

169

Hlon. Mr. CALDER: Honourabie members,
1 dare say there may be necessity for change
in administration of the iaw regarding trading
wi*th Indians for furs, but as yet it bas not
been mnade quite clear to me. As I understand
it, at the present time ail through that north
country any person can trade witb an Indian;
there is no restriction. Now apparently sametbing bas happened. I dare say the aeropiane
fias had something to do with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So the Minister
says.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. At any rate
sometbing bas happened, and now it is proposed ta allow trade with the Indians, not by
any persan wbo wishes, but oniy by such
persans as are seiected by the Indian Department officiais. That is my understanding.
They muet
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
obtain a permit.
An Hon. SENATOR: Tbey are on the spot.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes; and they may
have their favourites, and the permits may be
issued. under conditions by certain persons.
At ieast, Parliament shouid decide the principle upan whicb those permits are to be
granted. It shouid not be left in the hands
of individual Indian agents or officers. I amn
not making any accusation against officers as
a ciass, but we know what can happen and
what may happen under such legisiation. For
that very reason I agree with my right honourable friend ta my ief t (Right Han. Mr.
Meiglien) that when we undertake this ciass
of legisiatian we shouid know, at least the
basic principles of the law under wbich we
are working. As bas been said, we are not
making any law at ail. We are simply proposing that the Governor in Councii, through
certain officers, may do certain things, and
we do nat know the principles upon which
thase things will be done. At least, this
Pariiament is nat iaying down the principies
upon which tbey shail be done. It laoks ta
me like bad legisiation. Once we decide on
the basis of a iaw, we shouid nat hesitate ta
give power by Order in Council ta administer
that iaw.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. CALDER: That is an entirely
different thing. There is no harm. in an Order
in Couneil that is made for the purpose of
administration of a iaw which Pariiament bas
passed. But, as bas been well said, we are
nlot passing any iaws in this case; we are
simpiy giving autbority ta make laws, wbicb
is an entireiy different thing. I think the
Bill shouid go ta committee, and we should

14879--12
ILEVISEDEflITION

SENATE
have those in authority who know something
about what they want come before the committee and explain the situation a little more
fully.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable members,
the explanatory note states that sections 40
and 41 of the present Act prohibit the buying
or acquiring from any band or irregular band
of Indians or from any Indian of any cattle,
other animals, grain, root crops or other
produce on reserves in the province of Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta, or the Northwest Territories, without the written consent
of the Indian Agent. I quite realize that
domestic animals only are dealt with in those
sections, and that they forbid sales from
an Indian to a person outside the reservation except with the consent of the Indian
Agent, and probably subject to certain
rules he has adopted or which the department has directed him to follow. I
am wondering why the Minister of the
department promoting this legislation bas
decided it is necessary to adopt another
procedure when dealing with wild animals;
that is, to have control regulated by the
Governor in Council. When this Bill comes
up again for discussion, perhaps the honourable leader of the House will be kind enough
to give us the reason why a procedure already
adopted in reference to domestic animals is
departed from in this instance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Since we have
referred to the Baoking and Commerce Committee the preceding Bill, dealing with the
fur trade, I ask that this Bill be read a second
time and referred to that committee. Then
we shall have the officials of the department
before us on the two Bills.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG moved the second
reading of Bill E3, an Act to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
He said: The purpose of this Bill is to
provide that the Unemployment Insurance
Commission created by the Unemployment
Insurance Act, 1940, shall co-operate with
other authorities in the Dominion or provinces for the purpose of collecting information
concerning any plan for providing medical
care or compensation in cases of ill health.
In a word, it simply gives authority to the
commission to gather information.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

In order that there may be no misunderstand'ing of my remarks, I wish to put on
record a memorandum, or, as they say in
another place, "I shall pay close attention to
my notes."
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
will read.

In other words, you

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is unfortunate that the
Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940, did not
include health insurance. Even if there was
some reason for deferring health insurance,
the Act surely could have gone to the extent
of making it mandatory for the commission
to make an investigation of health matters,
as was done in the 1935 Bill, in this way preparing the way to bring in health insurance
at a later period.
However, may we not properly consider
that the Unemployment Insurance Act is the
first step in necessary social legislation, and
that the next step will be a health insurance
scheme?
This Bill will give authority to the Unemployment Commission to collect information
on health matters from the various provinces,
and also from the Canadian Medical Association or other bodies concerning plans for providing medical care, or compensation in case
of ill health. The data collected by the
Unemployment Insurance Commission will
form the basis for health insurance legislation.
Compulsory health insurance is more ideal
than voluntary health insurance, because it
accomplishes more for a greater number.
Health insurance, through which the employer,
the employee and the State make contributions to a common fund, provides a means
whereby the individual may secure the necessary medical care without being harassed by
the thought of inability to pay for such care,
should the necessity arise.
None of the health insurance laws that have
been studied can be accepted as a model.
Weaknesses are to be found in all of them.
The experience of other countries, however,
should be of great assistance to Canada in
moulding her health insurance legislation.
There are many arguments in favour of
health insurance being national in scope and
application. It would appear unlikely, however, from the various studies and judgments
which have been handed down, that Canada
could hope to have a national Health Insurance Act exactly like that which exists in
Great Britain or other countries. In spite of
the British North America Act, there appears
to be no sound reason why Canada cannot
have health insurance whieh is national in
scope, with national leadership and assistance,
and provincial in some respects, especially in
the field of administration.

JUNE 2, 1941

During recent years much study bas been
given to the subject of health insurance in
this country-and, I may say, in other
countries-and perhaps no more comprebhensive study has been undertaken hy any
group than bas been earried out by the CanaThe Association
dian Medical Association.
bas laid down what it believes to be certain
guiding principles which should forma tbe
foundation upon wbich health insurance sbould
be built in this country.
Blealth insurance is most applicable to lowwage earners and middle income class persons,
and should not be inclusive of all the bigher
income groups, because if it applied to everyone in tbe State, that would be an invitation
to state medicine, which I believe to he
entirely undesirable for Canada.
Wbat do we maean by state medicine? It bas
been clearly defined as a medical systema by
which the doctors are bired, paid and controlled by the State, there being no free choice
of doctor by patient, or otber doctor-patient
relationsbip, wbich is so fundamentally important in the treatrnent of disease. Health
insurance, on the other band, is a plan which
permits of the establishment of a fund contributed by the employer, the employee and
the State, on a basis of, say, 4-4-2, or some
other agreed basis, out of whicb fund the
patient's doctor of choice is paid for services
rendered. It will be seen, therefore, that
there is a vast difference between state mcdicine and health insurance.
How should this problema be approachied
The federal authorities maight
in Canada?
undertake te, set up certain standards and
principles and be prepared to give subsidies
to provinces wbich incorporate those standards and principles in provincial health insurance legislation. In respect to old age pensions there is a precedent for this policy. It
is unlikely that desirable social legisiation
whicb proves itsclf valuable in one province
will long be delayed in being put into effeet
in others. As Canada grows in nationbood
the necessity for a na:tional policy will becorne more manifest. If given leadership and
financial support, the provinces, in due course,
will undoubtedly faîl into line, even if this
involves giving up their jurisdiction or supposed jurisdiction in bcalth matters.
Wbat type of healtb insurance does Canada
want? Here we can learn- and profit by the
weaknesses to be found in some of the Acts
already in existence. Let us take, for instance,
the Health Insurance Act of Great Britain,
wbich bas been ini operation now for upwards
of thirty years. Ijnder tbat Act workers earning $1,250 a year in our money, or less, are
insured.
This includes upwards of twenty
14879--12 ý

171

million persons in Great Britain. The Act
provides that tbey rnay be served by the
doctor of their choice, who is paid on the
basis of 9 shillings per insured person per
year. The medical services available, however, are those of the general practitioner
and maternity variety, with no consultant or
hospital service heing paid for, and no servicee
being available to the dependents of the
insured. Herein is to be found the weakness
of the British scheme.
A satisfactory health insurance seheme
should provide complete medical services,
together witb specialist, hospital and nursing
services, nlot only to the insured, but also to
his dependents. The British Medical Association bas gone on record with this recommendation, after. nearly twenty-five years of
experience with the Act -which operates in
Great Britain. The f und should be sufficiently
substantial to provide adequate medical fees
and adequate hospital and nursing fees for
services rendered. The scope of the Act should
be sufficiently wide to cover ail low income
earners and their dependents, who, when
medical care is needed, find it too costly for
them to provide out of their own independent
budgets.
In the moulding of health insurance legislation, conferences should be held among
Government authorities, the healing professions, industry and labour, to determine the
principles upon wbicb the legisiation should
be based. Mucb difficulty and beartburning
wilM be prevented if this is donc at the outset.
The medical profession bas clearly defined
what it believes to be the guiding principles
from a medical point of view. The fact that
this study aliready bas been made by the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association will be
found to be of great value in any subsequent
conferences which may be held.
I need nlot dwell at any length, honourable members, on the henefit of sound health
in a comrnunity. I could quote authorities
to show what bas been donc in the matter

marvellous, and anytbing we can do along
these lines will be to the benefit of Canada.
I think 1 probably have as rnuch right as
any bonourable member of this Chamber to
propose this legislation, because 1 bave the
honour of being one of those who voted,
rigbtly or wrongly, in favour of the original
legislation. I arn not proposing, therefore, to
amend sornething that I voted against. I do
not ask that health insurance be made compulsory; all I aek is that the commission
report frorn tirne to tirne on the scbemes that
may be suggested. That is what the commission is for-to investigate these sehenes.

172

SENATE

I know some honourable members will rise and
say this will mean an expenditure of money.
It will not be so unless the commission first
reports that something is necessary and should
be done: then publie opinion will demand
it of the Government of the day. We shall
have fixed data to go on. I admit that it is
somewhat late in the session to introduce
legislation, but I think this matter should be
considered. Before rising to speak, I handed
a memorandum to the honourable leader of
the Government and the right honourable
leader of this side; so I am not trying to
spring something on them or on the House.
All I ask, honourable members, is your earnest
consideration of this proposal.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, I have received a statement
from the Department of Labour, which is
charged with the application of the Unemloyment Insurance Act. After read'ing this
statement showing the scope of the mandate of the Unemployment Commission, I
shall draw the attention of His Honour the
Speaker to the fact that this Bill is not within
the jurisdiction of this Chamber. I think
this statement will give a fairly good view of
the powers given to and the duties imposed
upon the commission, and the effects that
vould flow from this Bill.
The 1935 Emp.oyment and Social Insurance
Act imposed upon the Employment and Social
Insurance Commission the duty of collecting
information and data relating to medical, dental,
and surgical care, and compensation for loss of
earnings arising out of ill health, accident, or
disease. The relevant sections of that Act are
reproduced in Appendix A, attached. No such
provision has been included in the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1940, and it is deemed
inexpedient to make any such addition to the
Act at the present time.
The Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincia1 Relations investigated the matter of health
insurance and reached the conclusion that questions relating to health insurance ought to be
left. Extracts from the report of that commission are attached in Appendix B. It would seem
unwise for the Federal Government to take
action on this question until the constitutional
issue has been clarified. It is certainly undesirable to take steps which might have to be
retraced.
A further reason for deferring any such addition to the Insurance Act is the magnitude of
the task already imposed upon the Unemployment Insurance Commission. This commission
is attempting to set up in a matter of months
an institution which took three years to establish in Great Britain, and a comparable time
in the United States. In addition, the Uneinployment Insurance Commission is hampered
in securing deliveries of information by the
fact that other government departments are
accorded war-time priority.
Any additional
load would inevitably postpone the date when
Unemployment Insurance contributions could
begin.
Ilon. Mr. HAIG.

It is difficult to sec the use which might be
made of any statisties that the Unemployment
Insurance Commission would be in a position
to elicit. Even if it is considered that originally all measures of social security ought to bt
under some administrative agency, it is nevertheless true that the characteristics of an
unemployment insurance scheme do not lend
themselves to the collecting of statistits on
health and health insurance. When an insured
person becomes ill or otherwise incapable of
work, his claim for benefit is disallowed and the
Unemployment Insurance Commission loses contact with him. It is planned at the present
time to analyse disallowance on the grounds of
incapacity for work, but such statistits would
be of little va-lue as a background for shedding
light upon a health insurance scheme.
The coverage of a health insurance scheme
would, naturally, be more comprehiensive than
that of the unemployment insurance scheme.
Unemployment insurance takes no cognizance
of the illness of wives and children not in the
employment market, yet these persons would
naturally be .affected by a health insurance
scheme. It, would, therefore, be expensive for
the Unemployment Insurance Commission te
expand its operations so as te acquire statistical information which might be of value in
this connection.
The form of health insurance legislation is,
to a large degree, standardized in varions countries of the world, and it is by no means certain
that any information the commission might
secure would affect the form of statute that
might be enacted at a later date when the
constitutional situation is clarified and when
the unemployment .insurance scheme is in ful:
operation.
Then follows Appendix A. which contains
certain clauses of the Bill of 1935.
39. The duties and powers of the Commission
under this Part of this Act shall be exercised,
se far as may be found practicable and expedient, in co-operation with any department or
departments of the Government of Canada, with
the Dominion Council of Health, with any
province or any number of provinces collectively,
or with any municipality or any number of
municipalities collectively, or with associations
or corporations.
I think those very words are to be found
in the Bill before us.
40. It shall be the duty of the Commission
(a) to assemble reports, publications, information and data concerning any scheme or plan,
whether a state, community or other scheme or
plan for any group or class of persons, and
whether in operation or proposed, in Canada or
elsewhere. of providing. on a collective or on a
co-operative basis by means of insurance or
otherwise, for
(i) medical, dental and surgical care, including medicines, drugs, appliances, or
hospitalization, or
(ii) compensation for loss of earnings arising out of ill health, accident or disease;
(b) to analyse and make available to any
province, municipality, corporation or group of
persons desiring to use the information so
assembled for the purpose of providing such
benefits or any of them; and
(c) as far as may be found practicable so
te do on request by any province, municipality.
corporation or group of persons, te examine and

JUNE 2, 1941
report on any such scheme or plan proposed to
be put into effect or in effect at the date of
such request, and ta afford technical and professional guidance in regard ta the establishing,
working or reorganization of the scheme or
plan.
41. The Commission may from time to time
submit to the Governor in Council proposals
for co-operation by the Dominion in providing
any of the benefits enumerated in paragraph
.(a) of the next preceding section of this Act
for such action as the Governor in Council is
authorized to take, and may undertake special
investigations in regard thereto, subject to
approval of the Governor in Council concerning
the scope and nature of each such investigation.
Then comes Appendix B, the opinion of the
Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial
Relations, and its recommendations; Book II,
page 42:
Since social and economic conditions and
social outlook differ so greatly from province
to province, we consider it essential that with
certain exceptions responsibility for providing
medical and hospital services and the choice of
means should be left ta the provinces. Among
possible means is that of health insurance.
The desirability of co-ordinating all med-ical
services within the province under provincial
control is a strong argument against the establishment of any scheme which would remove any
large group within the province from provincial
responsibility, as a Dominion health insurance
scheme would do. Any health insurance scheme
should be closely co-ordinated with other medical
services, especially with those services providing medical assistance for low income groups. .
Health insurance differs profoundly from unemployment insurance and contributory old age
pensions (sometimes called old age insurance).
Unlike unemployment insurance, health ineurance is net subject to wide variations in demand;
the risks are more easily estimated, and more
constant. It is not subject ta cyclical fluctuations, or sudden emergencies making widespread
and prolonged drains on reserve funds, except
that, in the event of widespread unemployment, premiums may be difficult or impossible
to colleet. Unlike contributory old age pensions, health insurance is not a compulsory
savings scheme requiring individual accounts
covering many working years. It is more nearly
ineurance properly so called-in the sense that
it covers a contingent risk for a short term, and
is terminable on a fixed date or on fixed conditians. No serious problems of reserves or of
bookkeeping for a migratory labour force are
thus likely ta arise. We see, therefore, no
insuperable obstacle to the establishment of
health insurance by a province.
At page .34 of the commissioners' recommendations it is stated:
We cannot see that it would be practicable
ta assign public health exclusively either ta
the Dominion or to the province. Much of the
actual administration must be left ta local or
municipal authorities, and se long as the province has general jurisdiction over the munieipalities the Dominion could not satisfactorily
direct or control·local health authorities. Moreover, the educational phase of public health
must be cloesely linked with public education.
It is no less important that local public health
administration be closely linked ta public wel-

173

fare services, which, like education, are mainly
local and provincial functions. While certain
specialized services, such as hospitalization for
tuberculosis, might be provided by the Dominion
as efficiently as by the provinces, this is not af
itself a reason for any shift in jurisdiction.
Finally, there are pronounced regional differences in Canada in social philosophy which are
bound, ta affect public health legislation.
Centraization of jurisdiction might not, therefore, conduce 'to progressive action in public
heath, or ta national unity in general.
Provincial responsibilities in health matters
should be considered basic and residual.
Dominion activities, on the other hand, should
be considered exceptions ta the general rule of
provincial responsibility, and should be justified
in each case on the merit of their performance
by the Dominion rather than by the province.
Mere importance of a service does not justify
its assumption by the Dominion.
That is the opinion of the royal commission
which was presided over, before his illness.
by the Hon. MT. Chief Justice Rowell, and
afterwards by the late Dr. Sirois, and of which
Mr. Dafoe and others were members.
Honourable senators will readily see that
this Bill would result in expenditure of considerable funds, because the work of the
Unemployment Insu-rance Commission would
necessarily be made much heavier. Let us
look at the provisions of the measure, to test
whether it is a money bill, which should be
initiated only in the House of Commons, and,
even there, only when preceded by a resolution
having the assent of His Excellency the Governor General. The Bill provides:
1. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940,
chapter forty-four of the statutes of 1940, is
amended by inserting therein, immediately after
section ninety-three thereof, the following headings and sections:Part V
National Health
93A. The duties and powers of the Commission under this Part of this Act shall be
exercised, se far as nay be found practicable
and expedient, in co-operation with any department or departments of the Government of
Canada, with ·the Dominion Council of Health,
with any province or any number of provinces
colleotively, or with any municipality or any
number of municipalities collectively, or with
associations or corporations.
93B. It shall be the duty of the Commission

93C. The Commission may froi time to time
submit 'to the Governor -in Couneil proposals
for cooperation by the Dominion in providing
any of the benefits enumerated in paragraph
(a) of the next preceding section of this Act
for such action as the Governor in Council
is authorized to take, and may undertake
special investigations in regard thereto, subject te approval of the Governor in Council
coneerning the scope :and nature of each such
investigation.
In view of the memorandum which I read
to the House, it is quite clear that the carrying
out of these provisions would necessitate the
spending of a good deal of money. For one
thing, there would have to be a considerable
increase in the staff. Experts on health subjects would be required, and many other
persons would ie employcd in obtaining from
the whole of Canada data upon which te
aase further legislation. I am con.vinced that
such a bill can be introduced, not in this
House, nor by a private member of the House
of Gommons, but solely in the Commons by
a member of the executive, on a resolution
bearing the assent of His Excellency the Governor General. I submit this as a point of
order for a ruling by His Honour the Speaker.
Hon. L. COTE: The honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), in the
earlier part of his remarks, lad already given
quite convincing arguments against the passage
of this Bill, and I am sorry he thought it
necessary to raise a constitutional point which,
if maintained, would in my opinion unduly
limit the powers of the Senate. . The honourable gentleman argues that in order to fulfil
all the functions assigned to the Unemployment Insurance Commission by this Bill it
would become necessary for the commissien to employ many additional clerks
and other employees. thereby
incurring
therefore
expense, and that
considerable
the Bill would, if passed, involve an expenditure of money, which this House has
no right to authorize or direct. I cannot
follow the honourable leader on that point.
It may very well be that the necessary work
would be much better done if additional
employees were taken on, but this Bill does
not say anything about increase in staff or
expenditure of money. It merely contemplates that the commission, already established

by statute and paid salaries that will remain
the same whether this Bill becomes law or net,
shall make certain investigations. Of course,
the commission might later have to say,
"With the ways and means that Parliament
has placed at our disposal we cannot do all
that the Bill requires."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend read the proposed new section 93B?
Hon. Mr. COTE: I have read it, and I
followed the honourable leader when be was
speaking. The quantum of work to be performed by the commissioners would be limited
by their physical capacity to work. To argue
that the fact of their task being better or more
thoroughly done if they had additional clerks
or other employees makes this a Bill either for
appropriating money out of the public revenues
or for imposing taxation-these being, so far
as I know, the only two purposes of money
bils-is going too far. If this measure is to be
regarded as a money bill, theon we shall have
te conclude that any measure which would
impose a single added duty on any employee
of the Crown and might necessitate paying
more in salary or for assistance is therefore an
appropriation or taxation bill. That scems to
me entirely unreasonable. Although I am disposed to vote against this Bill, I certainly
do not want it thought that my vote was
influenced by the honourable leader's argument on the constitutional point.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I thoroughly agree with the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté).
I think it would be a dangerous stand to take
that this Bill cannot be introduced in the
Senate because ij might result in certain
expenditure, large or small. The point does
not depend upon the amount of money
involved. It seems to me that this House has
a constitutional right to pass legislation that
necessitates some expenditure. Now, where
are you to draw the line? You cannot draw
it at $100,000 or $50,000 or $10,000 or $2,000
or $1. There is a principle at stake. If this
Bill were to pass both Houses and become
law, Parliament could still refuse, if it so
chose, to pass the necessary appropriation to
make the Bill effective. But te have the Bill
thrown out on the point of order raised by
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
would, I think, be very unfortunate.

placing upon the Unemployment Insurance
Commission work that would be entirely
inconsistent with the functions of that
commission.
My honourable friend from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) is looking for a
favourable decision from the Speaker to set
aside this Bill because it is a money bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I understood you

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I trust that when
you are being pleased, you will intimate to
the Senate, and to those on the outside who
are interested, that this Bill was submitted
by a private meinber in another place, and
because under the rules it happened to go to
the foot of the list, it was sent over here,
where an enthusiastic, sincere helper of the
unfortunate people of Canada was found
readyHon. Mr. HAIG: Any objection to that?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -to press the Bill.
Now, my honourable friend from Winnipeg
argues that this is not a money bill. Let me
read just a few words-not the whole Bill.
The Unemployment Insurance Commission
by this measure is authorized to do what?
to afford technical and professional guidance
in regard to the establishing, working or
reorganization of the scheme or plan.
What "scheme or plan"? It has nothing to do
with unemployment insurance, but is a scheme
or plan which contemplates health insurance,
"medical, dental and surgical care." These
are very necessary functions for some body.
I am quite sure my honourable friend from
Winnipeg has not this in mind, but if this
Bill were incorporated, as it is proposed to
incorporate it, in the unemployment insurance
scheme, it would answer what is the desire
of a good many people in this Canada of
ours-their desire to prevent the unemployment insurance scheme from functioning as
a going concern.
I know my honourable
friend from Winnipeg wants the scheme to go
full speed ahead, but this Bill, I repeat, would
prevent that from being done. Many persons
whole-heartedly sympathetie towards this Bill
have no other purpose than that the Bill
should be passed. .I hope some day a measure
of this kind will be passed in the proper
place, but not here. The only purpose of those
persons who are whole-heartedly sympathetie
Hon. Mr. MUJDOOK.

towards this Bill is to gum up the cards and
prevent the Unemployment Insurance Act
from being put into effect. That is the object
of many people throughout the length and
breadth of Canada.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If no other
honourable members desire to speak on the
point of order, I should like the privilege of
deferring my ruling on this very important
matter until to-morrow.
The debate was adjourned.
ADJOURNMENT-INDIAN

BILL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before moving
adjournment of the Senate until to-morrow, I
should like members of the Banking and
Commerce Committee who will hear discussion
of Bill 24 to amend the Indian Act, which we
have referred to them, to direct their attention to chapter 98 of the Revised Statutes of
1927. Section 40 reads:
The Governor in Council may make regulations for prohibiting or regulating the sale,
barter, exchange or gift by any band or
irregular band of Indians, or by any Indian
of any band or irregular band, in the province
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta, or the
Territories, of any grain or root crops, or other
produce grown upon any reserve, and nay
further provide that such sale, barter, exchange
or gift shall be null and void, unless the same
are made in accordaneo with such regulations.
In particular I direct the attention of my
honourable friend from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Coté) to that section so that he may
not forget to bring it to my attention
to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I was reading the explanatory note when I said that sections 40 and 41
of the Act prohibited the sale of cattle by an
Indian except with the consent of the Indian
Agent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the Indian
Act states the Governor in Council may have
all those powers.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I must conclude that the
explanatory note is both misleading and
inaccurate.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 88, an Act to amend the
Special War Revenue Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We could- perhaps take up this Bill now. I do not know
whether my right honourable friend has
examined it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I have.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is what
might fairly be called an omnibus Bill, inasmuch as it covers a number of items of
taxation. There may be no special reason
why it should be sent to committee. With
leave of the House, I would move the second
reading now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection to second reading, but I do ask that
the Bill be sent to committee, and I will
explain why. This Bill to amend the Special
War Revenue Act is in form and all important
respects a taxation measure.. Therefore,
ordinarily we should have no inclination to
amend or defeat it except in consonance with
the policy as set down in the House of
Commons. In the past there have been
cases where taxation measures were used as
means of effecting an object ulterior to the
taxation. On one occasion a measure in the
form 'of criminal law was passed by both
Houses and later declared by the Privy
Council to be null and void, on the ground
that under the guise of criminal law, which is
within the purview and jurisdiction of the
Dominion, we had in reality invaded a field
which was rightly occupied solely by the
provinces. In a word, the holding has been
that it is the pith and substance of the law
which must be looked to in determining
whether or not it is really a taxation law,
such as this purports to be, or a criminal law,
such as the other legislation to which I
referred purported to be. At the moment I
cannot accurately cite the measure which it
was afterwards held we had improperly passed
under the guise of criminal law, but I know
it had to do with insurance matters. No
doubt honourable members who are more
regularly in practice than I am can readily
name the measure. By making something a
crime we had sought to effect a purpose which
we could not effect directly, because the

177

matter came within provincial jurisdiction.
The same objection applies to taxation law
passed for any such purpose.
I make this point because I observe that
sections 3 and 4 of this Bill would in reality
have the effect of ousting the provinces from
their jurisdiction. I do not look for a very
elaborate discussion here, although I should
like to hear one. I merely indicate what I
have in mind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To what part
of the Bill is my right honourable friend
referring?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Sections 3
and 4. It will be observed that section 3
alters the definition of a "British company."
Under the present definition a "British company" means any corporation incorporated
under the laws of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland or any
British Dominion or colony, and it was
specifically made to include that great insuranèe organization or association known as
Lloyd's. By this amendment in section 3,
Lloyd's are expressly excepted from the definition of a British company. The effect of the
change will appear later.
On looking at section 4 it will be observed
that the amendment merely does one thing:
it inserts in the fourteenth line the words "or
of any province thereof."
Hon. Mr. EULER: It strikes those words
out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I mean, it
strikes them out. As a result, there becomes
applicable a special taxation clause which,
when the Insurance Acts were before Parliament, was inserted in order to secure taxes
from a class of companies which otherwise
would escape. I forget for the moment the
name of that class.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Non-tariff.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Mutual.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, not mutual
either. It was a class of companies that had
an arrangement of their own.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 'Was it the class
of American companies doing business here
under licence?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, under
the New England mutual system. That is
what I had in mind. In those days the
Senate had some important functions to perform, and those Insurance Acts all received
the closest attention here. For the purpose

178

SENATE

of allowing such companies to operate in
Canada and enabling this country to get some
revenue from them, a clause was inserted
whereby we did what we could to put them
on a level with other companies and leave
thern no advantage. Accordingly the Act was
made to read as section 16 reads now, on the
page opposite page 2 of this Bill, namely:
Every person resident in Canada who, after
the thirty-first day of Decenber, 1931, insures
or bas insured his property situate in Canada
in whicl lie bas an insurable interest, other
than that of an insurer of such property , or
renews or bas renewed any such insurance,
against risks other than marine ri.sks,
(a) with any British or foreign company;
It will be observed that as a result of the
elimination of Lloyd's as a British company.
effected by section 3, this taxation will not
apply to them.
or (b) with any exchange, the chief place of
business of which exchange or of its principal attorney-in-fact is situate outside of
Canada,
which, on or before the first day of July, 1932.
or at the time such insurance is effected or
renewed if after the last mentioned date, is
not authorized under the laws of the Dominion
of Canada or of any province tliereof to transact
the business of insurance, shall, on or before
the first day of March, 1933, and on or before
the first day of March in each year thereafter.
pay to the Minister, in addition to any other
tax payable under any other existing law or
statute, a tax of ten per centum oi the net
premiums paid or payable by such person in
respect of such insurance for the next preceding
calendar year.
That is to say, anyone insuring in one of
those companies described briefly as "nonCanadian," a British company-not including
Lloyd's-or an exchange whose head office is
outside of Canada, unless that non-Canadian
company bas had from the Dominion or from
a province a licence to do business, must pay
to the Crown an additional 10 per cent of the
whole premium.
Now, by this Bill we are asked to strike
out the words "or any province thereof."
This means that if one of those companies
bas a provincial rather than a Dominion
licence, its insurers-its customers, we will
call them-will be taxed. If it bas a Dominion licence they will not be taxed; if it bas
a provincial licence, they will be. Anybody
can see at once the discrimination against the
provincial company; and it does look to me
as though we were again seeking to effect
under the guise of our taxation jurisdiction a
purpose that we cannot effect directlyvirtually to compel Dominion registration.
I do not think we should do that. The matter
will be argued out, of course, when we get to
committee, but I ask honourable members to
look into it carefully, because I do not like
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

this constant practice of. seeking to do
indirectly
what
we
cannot
accomplish
directly.
I am informed-this information comes only
from the solicitor for the company concerned
-that
the only company affected is an
American company which was licensed first in
Quebec and then in Ontario. It bas been
operating in Quebec for about six or seven
years, and in Ontario for about four years.
On account of certain associated concerns
who were all doing business with it in the
United States, this company thought it well
to get its licences in these two provinces. Its
total premium income is about $4,360, on
which the 10 per cent would amount to $436.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Does that mean that
this amendment will touch only that one
company?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, so I am
informed.
Hon.
Mr.
Lloyd's?

MURDOCK:

What

about

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
joke. I shall come to that. The solicitor
says t-here is only the one comrpany. If that
is the case, the income we shall get will be
approximately $436 a year; so it can hardly
be said we are passing a law for the purpose
of taxation.
The honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) asks, "What about
Lloyd's?" I should like to hear frorn Mr.
Finlayson about that. I bave never known
him to be unpatriotically favourable to
Lloyd's; such bas not been his disposition;
but for some reason Lloyd's escape by this
Bill. If the amended section 3, excluding
Lloyd's frorn the definition of a "British
company," were not in this Bill, they would
have to register federally or else all their
'ustomers in Canada-and they are legionwould have to pay a 10 per cent tax. Before
the one company with provincial registration
is struck at, Lloyd's are set to one side and
escape; they are no longer deemed to be a
British company.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
great difficulty with us.

That was a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: It was a
great difficulty. I cannot help thinking Mr.
Finlayson bas a reason for letting Lloyd's
out, but I do not know what the reason is.
It may be that they are registering federally.
But, whatever the reason may be, Lloyd's are
out and this one company is in. There may
be others in. I have only the word of the
solicitor of the company that this is the
only company affected. However, the prin-

JUNE 3, 1941

ciple is this: either we have a right to conpel companies to register federally, or we
have no such right. The courts have held
we have no such right. If we have it not,
let us not seek to exercise it in the guise of a
taxation law.
I regret that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the solicitor who approached my right honourable friend did not approach me and give
me some information which would have
enabled me to study the question before I
moved the second reading of the Bill. Of
course we had considerable discussion of these
matters in committee and in the Senate
some few years ago. I have no objection
to our sending the Bill to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. It cannot reach the
committee before to-morrow, because already
we have our hands full, but I will see that
the Department of Finance is represented and
that the Superintendent of Insurance, Mr.
Finlayson, is also present.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
DIVORCE JURISDICTION BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. CHARLES TANNER, Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills, presented -the committee's
report on Bill N2, an Act to amend the
Divorce Jurisdiction Act, 1930.
He said: Honourable senators, there is just

apart from her husband for not less than two
years immediately preceding the date of the
commencement of such action or proceeding.

WAR EXCHANGE CONSERVATION BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 77, an Act to amend
The War Exchange Conservation Act, 1940.

179

He said: Honourable senators, this is one
of the consequential bills flowing from the
Budget presented this session by the Minister
of Finance. Here is what he said concerning
one of the principal features of the Bill:
Very substantial changes are recommended in
respect of schedule Il of the Act, the schedule
extending war-time treatment to imports from
the United Kingdom. Though a large number
of items are affected, I can explain briefly what
is recommended. For the cotton and artificial
silk items, now free under the Act, no change
is recommended. Certain items, on which -the
United Kingdom has asked for concessions, viz.,
cellophane, bathroom fixtures and earthenware
glass manufactures n.o.p., nickel-plated ware,
and needles, are to be made free, it is recommended under schedule II. It is further recopimended that the British preferentail rates be
subject to a discount of 25 per cent in the case
of woo|llen and worsted yarns, warps, fabrics,
and clothing, and boots and shoes, that duties
on fabrics and articles of linen, jute, hemp, and
mixed fibres, oileloth and linoleum, carpets, rugs,
and carpeting, and all items (not already free)
in groups I, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX .and XI
of the Customs Tariff (with the exception
already mentioned of boots and shoes) be made
subject to a discount of 50 per cent. No modification of the rates on liquors, sugar, tobacco,
and silks is suggested. The result will be that,
aside from the revenue items just mentioned,
ail imports from the United Kingdom will be
free or subject te British preferential duties
reduced by 50 or 25 per cent. The discounts
proposed are to be in lieu of and not additional
to the 10 per cent reduction now applicable
for direct shipment. In the case of woollens
the 25 per cent reduction will apply to the
British preferential ad valorem and specific
rates of duty, but. the operation of the limitation of the duty of 50 cents per pound as a
maximum will remnain unaffected.
These sweeping reductions are made to
facilitate movement of goods from the United
Kingdom. It is not expected that imports
from the United Kingdom will increase significantly. The difficulties of shippin are well
known. Labour in the United Kingdom is
being withdrawn even from export trades to
war industries, and in many cases materials
are lacking. We are suggesting sweeping reductions for the express purpose of facilitating the
importation of whatever goods, under changing
circumstances, the United Kingdom wishes to
export to us. It may be that she will find it
desirable to curtail ber exports to us. In such
case, we shall do without them. We desire to
leave the greatest possible scope for selling to
us whatever goods she wishes to seil.
That comprises one of the main features of
the Bill, which is to be found in clause 1.
Clause 2 reads:
2. Subsection one of section eight of the said
Act is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:The Governor in Council in order to increase
or conserveThe last two words are added.
-Canada's supply of foreign exchange may, on
the recommendation of the Minister of Finance,
enter into agreements with individuals, partnerships or corporations to grant assistance by way
of special tax credits and/or special allowances

180

SENATE

for depreciation or depletion under the Income
War Tax Act and/or the Excess Profits Tax
Act, if, in the opinion of the Governor in
Couneil, such assistance is neeessary in order
that an expansion of the exports of any
individual, partnership or corporation receiving
such assistance may take place or that the
experts of any such individual, partnership or
corporation may be maintained at levels higher
than would otherwise obtain, . . .
To that clause these new words are added:
or, in the case of any individual, partnership
or corporation operating an oil well or oil wells,
if in the opinion of the Governor in Council
such assistance is necessary in order that sufficient drilling of new wells may take place to
maintain or extend the production of oil in
Canada and if the Minister of Mines and
Resources certifies that such drilling is in oilbearing areas which give reasonable prospect
of yielding producing wells.
Then follows the last sentence in the clause,
which is unchanged:
The provisions of any such agreements granting
special tax credits and/or special allowances for
depreciation or depletion shall bu effective notwithstanding anything contained in the Income
War Tax Act or the Excess Profits Tax Act.
Section 3 of the Bill deletes certain items
from Part One of Schedule One of the Act.
Section 4 further amends Part One of
Schedule One by inserting therein a number
of items and enumerations. The first item
mentioned is black tea. Permits will not bu
granted for importation of black tea from nonsterling countries. The reason is obvious. The
next item inserted in the schedule is:
Games and puzzles; mirror frames.
The purpose of this insertion is simply to clear
up anomalies in the Act.
Section 5 amends Part Two of Schedule
One by inserting therein the item of vegetable
oils. The effect of this amendment is to
require a permit for importation of vegetable
oils shipped from non-sterling countries after
the 29th of April of this year.
In the
administering of permits the Department of
National Revenue will bu assisted by the Oils
Administrator, under the War-Time Prices
and Trade Board.
I think I have fairly covered the main points
of this Bill.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

DOMINION

SUCCESSION

DUTY

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 79, an Act to authorize
the levying of Duties in respect of Successions.
He said:
Honourable senators, this is a
fairly important piece of legislation, dealing
with a matter that is new to the Dominion
Parliament. It has been deened proper and
necessary that we should enter the field of succession duties. Some of the provinces, if net
ail, already impose succession duties. In support of a federal measure like this I heard
an interesting argument, which contained what
I think is an intelligent observation on our
economic system. It was to the effect that
the Dominion is justified in taxing successions
because people who die leaving wealth have
in many cases accumulated it by activities
in more than one province, and in some cases,
by activities throughout Canada. I can think
of quite a number of large estates that bave
been created by operations outside of the
province in which the deceased lived. I am
net in a position to compare this point of
view with that of the provinces, who, no
doubt, can give very good reason for levying
duties upon estates within their own jurisdictiens. In any event, it seems te me there is
a strong argument in favour of the Dominion
getting a share of the estates of men who,
while accumulating wealth, used and enjoyed
the resources of the whole country.
If the Bill is gîven second reading I shall
move that it bu referred te the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, this is, I think, our first taxation
measure which can rightly be described as a
capital levy. Such a levy is, of course, not
receiving its initiation here, for many countries
and ail. or nearly all our provinces already
impose succession duties. Undoubtedly the
needs of the Dominion are greater than those
of any province. I do net think there are
many persons, no matter how they may have
toiled, or what vicissitudes they may have
encountered, or how great may have been their
devotion te life's purposes, who are not ready
now te hand to the federal authorities anything
at ail, provided it is used for the prosecution
of this conflict and the saving of our community and our lives. I do not look for
anyone having much when we are through
with this war, and I do net think many people
care greatly whether they will have much
or not.
I will net oppose this measure. The only
thing that really disturbs me is this: the

JUNE 3, 1941
popularity of every measure which takes from
those who have anything. What disturbs me
is, not the necessity of taking-the need
exista and lias to be met-but the prevalence
of the belief that the taking is a virtue. That
belief rnay perhaps derive somes support even
fromn the remarks of the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who said
that as men who have created estates had
access to th 'e resources of the whole country,
it is just that the Dominion should take
something back.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Dominion
levy is just, as compared with provincial
le vies.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Support for
such a measure has to be based, flot on
justice, but on need. We are-in a desperate
pliglit. We have to do things like this; there
is no way of avoiding them. We must accept
thema cheerfully, and without resistance. But I
do not like the attitude-which is encouraged
politically, because it makes ývote-getting easy
-that there is some virtue in penalizing success, industry and enterprise. No one can
read the luminous pages of Gibbon'ýs Decline
and Eall of the Roman Empire, nor the
history of the decline and fail of any other
empire, without seeing as plainly as hie sees
his alphabet that the real cause of the fait
was the insecurity of private property. Let
none of us imagine that if we keep on as we
have been going we can hold society together.
We cannot. We must do what the emergency
of the hour demands, but we should realize
that once property is stripped of that measure
of security which. stirs human ambitioji and
energy and cails f orth ail that is in man, the
very foundation of society itself is removed.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- My right honourable friend will admit that lis argument is
weaker when the question has to do with
taxing estates of dead persons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, not at
ail. 1 think any worth-while man is just as
much concerned to be of some help to those
hie brings into this world as hie is to see to it
that he himself shah be comfortable in his
closing days. One ambition is just as proper
as the Cther. I should like to see an effort
made by some others to bring home to our
people the immortal truth that once you
destroy property you destroy liberty. The
t.wo can never be divorced. You cannot have
political liberty and economie thraldom.
They neyer live together for an hour. The
day will come when this eternal principle,

181

which lias -come down through ail the ages,
will demand from mankind an intelligent
recognition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is my right
honourable friend agreeable to having this
Bill sent to committee?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I said
that I was not opposing the measure. We
cannot help ourselves now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
say just a word or two with reference to my
right honourable friend's statement.
The
heirs are usually the sons or daughters of the
men who have accumulated the wealth. As
my right honourable friend knows, in certain
countries they have not always followed in
the footsteps of their fathers. I should like
to cite a statement made hy Andrew Carnegie
before a committee of the United States
Senate some years ago. He had been examined
on the influence which wealthy corporations
wield in Wall street, and, as lie was about to
leave, a senator put this question to him:
Did lie flot think a certain limit should be
placed on the individual accumulation of
wealth? Carnegie answered: "No. There is a
special aptitude or talent"ý-he did not say
"lgenius", for the question concerned him as
well as others-"'in making money and
accumulating wealth. I would not discourage
the activities of a man so bent upon doing
things that will bring him large monetary
rewards; but I would have Congress enact
that lie may not beave his children more than
a certain portion, say a tenth, of his wealth,
the remaining nine-tenths to revert to the
State. An enactmnent of this kind would tend
to inculcate a spirit of philanthropy in wealthy
men, for, knowing that the bulk of their
estate would flow back to the public treasury,
they would try to distribute it during their
lifetime. I am getting rid of my wealth by
founding public libraries throughout the
country, and my friend Rockefeller is endowing various universities. These are things
whidli the State cannot very well undertake,
but men of wealth can, and so they serve
the public interest?" Let me add that thougli
I am not in Carnegie's category, I share bis
opinion.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable members, I
am not rising to discuss the principie of levying succession duties, for that principle was
accepted many years ago by the provincial
authorities. I concede the strength of the
argument that there should be but one succession duty collected in Canada; in other words,
that a man's estate should not be taxed by
nine different provinces if lie happens to

SENATE

182

possess wealth in each of those provinces.
Frankly, I am one of those who have long
been hoping that the time is near when we
could get rid of nine taxing authorities and
have succession duties collected by the federal
authority.
This is not the only tax in which there is
duplication, and the duplication is becoming
unbearable. I belong to the school that
desires to simplify the taxation problems of
this country. Although I concede the point
that it is more natural and reasonable for the
Dominion to collect succession duties than
it is to leave collection in the hands of the
provinces, I shall not vote for this Bill with
any pleasure, because, instead of having nine
succession duty taxes, we are to have ten.
I regret exceedlingly that steps were not
taken to get rid of provincial taxation of this
sort before the Federal Government undertook to impose a succession duty tax.
Imposed, as it is, while the provinces still
collect such a tax, it does not appeal to me
at all, and I am sure it does not appeal to
many members in this House. However, we
are told this measure is necessary because we
must defend democracy and win the war. I
will accept the argument that it is absolutely
essential to raise succession duties at this
time. Only that argument can convince me
I should support the Bill.
On the other hand, we must not attribute
as the reason for every mistake we make that
we have to win the war. I believe it is
inexpedient to invade the succession duty
field at this time, when we already have nine
taxing parties going after a man's estate.
The honourable leader of the Government,
as a studient of history, will remember when
that famous woman Madame Roland, who
had fought for the liberties and rights of the
people, exclaimed as she stood before the
guillotine on the Place de la Concorde and
surveyed the Paris m.ob, "O Libertyl Libertyl
what crimes are committed in thy namel"
Let us not make too many mistakes about
saving democracy. I shall not vote against
the Bill, but I must say that in the circumstances it is with no degree of pleasure I
witness its passing.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
CONCURRENCE

IN

COMMONS

AMENDMENTS

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the amendments made by the House of
Hon. Mr. COTE.

Commons to Bill B2, an Act respecting the
British Columbia Telephone Company.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS moved that the
amendments be concurred in.
He said: I might explain that, with two
exceptions, the amendments are merely verbal.
The first important amendment is in respect
to the proposed increase of capital by $10,000,000.
This figure has been eut down to
$1,000,000, which is a very substantial reduction. The company accepts the amendment
only as of necessity, since there is no prospect
that if this House rejected it the Bill would go
through at all, and certain immediate capital
expenditures are essential for the development
of the activities of this company in giving
public service.
The other amendment is as follows:
No application for an increase of rates shall
be based on any increase of the issued stock
of the company as autlhorized by the amending
Act of 1941, but this provision shall not apply
to or limit the power of the Board of Transport
Commissioners for Canada (or any successors to
its powers) to fix just and reasonable rates
upon application by the company for increased
rates based on other grounds.
By way of illustration I will give the House
what I understand to be the general meaning
of that provision. Let us suppose an issue
of stock, the return from which was so recklessly or improvidently expended that there
would be no corresponding increase in efficiency of plant or service, and consequently
no commensurate increase in revenue. The
mere fact that the capital stock had been
incrcased would not bc a ground for an
application to increase rates. However, the
rights of the Board of Transport Commissioners are preserved and it may deal with
applications based on the ground that the
rates proposed are just and equitable.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I think that in justice to
this House it should be pointed out that in
the original Bill no carte blanche was given
to the company to increase its capital stock
by $10,000,000. The Bill provided that there
should be no such increase unless sanctioned by
the Transport Board; therefore the company
would be required to lay before the board
full plans of whatever improvements it
proposed for the purpose of establishing to
the satisfaction of the board that the desired
issue of capital stock was in the public
interest.
I am sure I speak for all honourable members when I say we feit that we must assume
the Transport Board nwas competent to perform its task and prôtect the public interest
in respect of any further capital issue. Even

183

JUNE 3, 1941
I have no reason to subtract in the least
from my confidence in the commissioners.
Although I do not know the personnel, I make
this comment, that the Commons amendments
are a distinct mark of lack of confidence in the
Transport Board. I cannot see h.ow the House
of Coanons can, in effect, say to the members
of tihe board, "We do neot trust you to perform
the functions for which you exist," and stili vote
money for their continuance. I have thought,
and I stili think, that the board is unduly
large and unduly expensive under present conditions. The purpose for which it was originally created has in great degree been served.
Its duties, while not wholly routine and governed by precedent, are largely so now. I
should be very happy if the Government saw
its way clear to reduce the personnel by
deciding nlot to fili vacancies as members
retire on the expiration of their termi of
office, or for other reasons. I do nlot think
we need so large a board. But since it exista,
I think we shaîl have to continue the board
as such-for a time anyway, and until I
have reason for withdrawing confidence in it
I shahl express that confidence and govern
myself in this House accordingly. I say this
because I still think that, while the sponsor
of the Bill is undoubtedly wise in accepting
the inevitable, the action of this House in
respect of the measure was much more governed by reason and commun sense tlian was
the action of the other House.

diction. After alI, $1,000,000 is not very much
te spend on a telephone company's extension
programme.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In reply to the honýourable gentleman I may say that I am afraid
the necessary result of one of these amendments will be that the company will have to
come back again. I do nlot think it will have
to comne back next year. Just how long it
will be before its retura becomes imperative,
I do net know. However, I arn very gla'd
the comments to which I have listened have
been made. They might be applied equally
to the provision in regard to any application
for inýcreased rates, because there can be no
mncrease of rates exce.pt with the sanction of
the Board of Transport Commissioners. I
think that is *a sound principle, and if Parliament feels jusýtified in creating a board to
decide such matters as these, Parliament, with
less information before it. than the Board of
Transport Commissioners would have, should
nýot undertake to deal with them. Under
other circumstances it miglit well be that the
Senate should pursue this question a little
further, but to do so at the present tirne would
be disastrous as far as the undertakings of this
company are concerned. 1 think also it should
be thoroughly undierstood that in what is
done at this time there is not necessarily any
precedent establlshed which would affect

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, I ehould like to add this remark to
the statement of m.y right honourable friend
(Ràglit Hon,. Mr. Meighen). From my knowledge of the workings of a telephone company
I know that its development caîls constantly
for -new capital. I have seen the growtth of
large telephone companies, and I feel that if
power is- granted this company to raise only
an additional million dollars of capital, that
will simply mean that very shortly it will
be neeessary to ask for a further increase of
capital stock. I rely on the statutory requirement that this company, as well as other
public utility corporations, must convince the
Board of Transport Commissioners that any
increase in capitalization is based on the publie

Hon. Mr. HARMER: I quite agree with

CANADA'S NATIONAL HEALTH
MOTION DROPPED

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Senator Sauvé:1. Whereas the strength of the nation depends
especially upon the health -of the Canadian
people;
2. Whereas the object of every effort, either
individual or social, is life itself, its preservation
and development;
3. Whereas in this period of war, anguish and
excess, it is all the more urgent to prevent
disease by protecting and fortifying health;
Therefore, be it resolved that this House
respectfully recommends that the Department of
National Health of Canada do
(,a) deal more severely with the elements
detrimental to health, especially with the
inereasing misuse of broadcast advertisements
recommending panaceas or certain commercial
articles of food and drink;
(b) sec that the danger of the abuse of
unsuitable foods and beverages be taught widely
by the Press and the radio and in schools;
(c) spread knowledge of the properties of
wholesome foods and beverages.-Hon. Senator

FIRST READING

The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read the second time?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: With leave
of the Senate, I would move the second
reading of this Bill now. If my right honourable friend is not ready to proceed, he may
move the adjournment of the debate. The
amendments are not very important, but they
are necessary. I will read the statement that
was made in another place by Hon. Mr.
Gardiner, the present Minister of National
War Services, who, from what I have heard,

intends to vacate that office.
This Act was passed shortly after Canada
entered the war, and has not been amended
since. It was not foreseen at that time that
there would be calls upon the generosity of the
public for contributions to war equipment;
eonsequently the provisions of the Act were
limited to contributions for wvar charities. As
a large number of 'funds are now operating
whose objects are to purchase war equipment,
it is felt desirable that these funds should be
subject to regulation. The Act was originally
administered by the Department of the Secretary of State, but after the inception of the
Department of National War Services the
administration was transferred to the War
Services Department. An amendment has been
necessary to provide for this.
Experience gained from administering the Act
makes it necessary that further contro be given
the department if the Act is to be properly
administered. We have found that in some
cases funds have been created without registration and without authorization, and we have
no authority under the Act to prosecute those
raising unregistered funds for failing to comply
with its provisions.
This amendment now
includes provision that wil.l give the department
the same control over unregistered funds as it
has over those which have been authorized
under the Act.
We have also found that persons have been
holding funds and have refused to make a
proper accounting of such funds to the department. An amendment has been necessary to
enable the department to demand such an
accounting and to secure possession of the
funds if necessary.
Proceedings for offences against the Act
cannot at present be instituted except with
the consent of the Minister. As the administration of justice is in the provinces, and
prosecutions are carried on by the AttorneysGeneral of the provinces, it is felt that the
present section restricts the right of the
Attorney-General to institute proceedings where
he deenms fit. The Act is now being amended
so as to permit the Attorneys-General of the
provinces to act either on their own initiative
or at the request of the department.

185

JUNE 4, 1941
With this explanation I move second reading
of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I believe
there is a less pleasant feature of the Bill,
whieh the honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) did not mention-a
further restriction on the amount that can
be allowed in respect of income tax calculation. However, the features mentioned by the
leader of the House are quite proper. It
seems amazing that in the first Bill no provision
was inserted for controlling or preventing
unregistered funds. Certainly this omission
must be made good. I suggest the Bill go
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.

PENSION BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented the committee's report on
Bill 17, an Act to amend the Pension Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
reported witb two amendments which are of
some considerable importance, and I assume
that after they have been read by the Clerk
there will be some discussion on them.
The amendments were read by the Cherk at
the Table.
The Hon. the SZEAKER: When shahl these
amendments be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Now, by leave of the
Senate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to concur in
the amendments?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Woulýd there be
any objection to leaving these amendments
over until to-morrow, so, that we might
analyse them?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desired. to
explain why I intend to move against adoption
of thiese amendmaents. Any honourable member who wishes to move adjournment of the
dehate wilI be free to do so after I have
spoken.
The committee recommends that section 5
of the.Bill be deheted and that subsection 3
I will read
of section 6 be amended.
subsection 3 of section 6:
If a mnember of the forces bas, while on
service during the w*ar with the Germnan Reich,
incurred an injury or disease or aggravation
thereof resulting in serious disabi.lity or death
in respect of which a pension is flot awardahle
under the provisions of the two subsections next
preceding and if such inember of the forces is
in necessitous circumstances, or, in the case of
his death, if his widow and/or children are in
necessitous ciTcumstances, or if, there being

no -widow or children, his dependent parent or
parents are in necessitous circumistances, the
Commission may in its discretion award such

pension, net exceeding the rates payable under

Schedules A or B to this Act, as f rom. time to
time it may deem to bie adequate in the
circumstances.
It will be seen that this subsection gives
the commission discretionary power in certain
circumstances to award a pension which would

SENATE
not otherwise be payable under the Act. Such
a pension would fall into the category of a
compassionate allowance. After considerable
discussion in a committee of the other House
this subsection 3 was added for the purpose
of giving authority to the commissioners to
grant a pension in cases where they felt it was
justified on compassionate grounds.

Our Banking and Commerce Committee
proposes that at the end of this subsection
the following words be added:
Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable to or in respect
of a member of the forces who, under regulations
made pursuant to the National Resources
Mobilization Act, 1940, has been called out for
training, service or duty and who, in pursuance
of further regulations made and established
under the aforesaid Act, is attached to or on
the strength of a basic or advanced training
2entre.
This proposed amendmant would exclude
from the benefits of the subsection all the
men called out under the National Resources
Mobilization Act. As honourable members
know, the men first called out under this Act
were given thirty days' training. They have
returned to their homes and are net to any
extent interested in this suggested proviso.
But all the men now called out for four
months' service, including those who have
already served about half that time, would be
ineligible for the same compassionate treatment as their comrades who volunteered and
are now training for the Active Army. That
is, the proposed amendment would create a
distinction between men in service. Those
called out under the authority of the State
and serving in Canada, or being trained in the
various camps from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, would be in a position of inferiority
vis-à-vis their comrades who voluntarily
enlisted and are training with them in the
same centres.
I may say that when the matter came
before us in the committee a good many
members, of whom I was one, were net able
fo tell exactly what the effect of this addi-ional clause would be. I am sure that it
would have an important psychological effect
upon the thousands of men who are now being
trained alongside voluntary soldiers. I believe
it would be harmful te the present campaign
to raise men to serve for the defence of the
country, either in Canada or abroad. After
I left the committee I inquired as to what
effect the proposed amendment would have.
In the various camps throughout the country
there are two groups of men being trained
together: one group under the voluntary
system and the other group under the conscriptive system. The men in the first group
are attested for active service; they belong
Ion. Mr. DANDURAND.

to the Active Army. There are 29 basic
training centres, where elementary as well as
advanced training is given. During the first
two months all the men are on virtually the
same footing in respect of their training;
they are prepared for the specialized courses
which they receive after the two months.
While they are taking the elementary part
they may indicate in which of the divers
branches of the service they would prefer to
receive specialized training. At every training
centre a certain number of openings in all
the branches are maintained for trainees who
have completed two months' training. Among
these trainees, who come from a great variety
of walks in life, are university and college
students and other men with education or
experience qualifying them for specialized
duties, and usually they do not hesitate to
choose those branches for which they have
special qualifications. During their first two
months of training the men called out under
the Act are allowed to transfer to the Navy
or the Air Force. It has been explained to
me that all these men, distributed among
the 29 training camps, receive there the same
training as do the men who voluntarily
enlisted and are training for the Active
Army. These two groups undergo the same
daily exercises, live under the same roof,
sleep in adjacent bunks, enjoy the same
privileges and are given the same kind of
treatment in all respects. This has helped
to develop a healthy comradeship which is a
great asset for the nation. The men called
out are in constant contact with the volunteers on active service and become their
friends and join them in various sports,
day in and day out. Jn a word, they become
members of the same army.
I have been informed by the department
that only 10 per cent of the men who took
the thirty-day training indicated their intention to enter the Active Army; but when the
four-month training plan was instituted and
the trainces were informed they would be
retained for service for the duration of the
war, the proportion jumcped to 40 per cent.
The view of the department is that the
passing of this proposed amendment would
have the effect of splitting each military camp
in two and placing a stigma of inferiority on
men who for various reasons did net voluntarily enlist in the early stages of the war.
Some were not ready, others had certain family
responsibilities. But eventually those men did
answer the call. They come from all sections
of this country and from all walks of life.
Some, by their technical training, have already
specialized in certain branches of the service.
I need not dwell upon the value and quality

JUNE 4, 1941
of those men, but I do say that neither the
Senate nor the Parliament of Canada should
lightly tell them that they belong ta another
class of soldiers. I arn told by those ini command of the training camps that trainees
and enlisted men work and play together
as members of ane big farnily, and are al
imbued with the same patriotie spirit. I arn
confident that no one in this Chamber would
for a moment suggest that thousands of men
called by the State to serve in our armed
forces should be trèated as though they were
an inferior class. Yet such treatment would
resuit from the amendment. Its adoption
would mean no saving to the country, because
these young men, after they have undergone
four months' training, enter the army for
service in Canada, or attest for service abroad.
Most of the trainees are single men, and it
is vexy improbable that many would meet with
accidents involving such physical injuries as
would bring them withmn the scope of the
pension provisions. 1 submit that psychologically it is a dangerous polîcy ta introduce
into this legislation, and herald ta the country,
the statement that we have two sets of men
who from a patriotic point of view cannot
stand on the same platforma or range themselves under the same standard. Ail those
men corne from Canadian families, they are
training together as brothers, and are doing
splendid work, helpîng anc another in their
training. In my opinion the Cammans showed
commendable prudence in flot introducing such
a wedge between those two groups.
For this reason 1 mave that the amendment
which I have just read be nat accepted. I
wiIl deal later with the other proposed amendment ta the Bill.
Han. F. B. BLACK: Hanourable senators,
in the Cammittee on Banking and Commerce
I did nat express any opinion an this particular amendment. Persanally, I do not think
it matters very much whether the amendment
carnies or nat. I must, hawever, take exception
ta the picture painted by +he honourable leader
of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I submit there is no discrimination between what
we cati "trailnees" and those who have enlisted
for service cither in Canada or overseas.
I 'ar nfot supporting the praposed amendment, but I want ta clarify the situation. I
have .hàd several years' experience in the
militia and a shorter experience in the army.
Under this amendment trainees would be
in the same position as militiarnen wha are
in camp for the annual twelve-day training.
That is, any traince injured during his period
of'training would, came under the Pension Act
just as though he had enlisted for active

187

service. There is, hawever, this minor difference in favour of the man who enlists for
service in Canada or overseas--that, barring
miscanduct, he enjoys the protection of the
Pension Act even while an leave, whereas the
trainee does flot. But the traince, as well as
the enlisted man, would corne under the Act
if, for instance. he were injured while engaged
in football, cricket or any other game as part
of -the soldier's physical training course.. I
recail the case of a man who fractured his leg.
He had medical. attention, but some tubercular
trouble supervened and he died. Under the
m ilitia regulations'I had fia difflculty whatever
in getting a pension for his widow and child. I
repeat, the trainee gets the same pension treatment as did the militiaman in the past.
While presiding over the comrnittee wbich
amended this Bill, I failed ta deteet any desire
on the part of thase who supparted the
amendrnent ta discrirninate against trainees.
And, as I have pointed out, there is no discrimination .whatever.
Frorn the standpoint of the army, I do not
think the arnendment makes the slightest
difference, for 1 doubt that it would either
prevent or encourage enlistrnents. Men
wha have had militia training are familiar
with the regulations, and ail we rnay say on
anc aide or the other wiil nat faal those in
commnand of a campany, a battalian or a
regirnent.
Persanally I arn not inclined ta favaur the
amendrnent. We must get recruits, and when
we do get them we -must give them al
reasonabie protection, and even same protection that is not reasonabie. We have
made liberal pension provision for aur
returned men. Indeed, sometirnes I feel we
have gane too far with aur pension legisiatian,
particularly in regard ta regulations gaverning
attributability and aggravation.
There is anc thing ta be said in favaur of
the praposed amendment-that it wouid probably prevent what I rnay terrm "artifleial"
claims being pressed on the Pension Board.
That board naturally is sympatbetic towards
claimants for pensions, and s0 we are apt
ta get a greater number af soldiers' widows
and ehiidren an the pension list than wauld
otherwise be the case.
I arn inclined to, accept the Bill in this
particular as it was presented ta the committee; but I arn now speaking as a member of
the Senate and not as chairman of the
Commîttee on Banking and Commerce.
Honaurable
Hon. R. B. HORNER:
senators, I arn in favour af the amendment
for the very reason the honourable the leader
of the Goverrnent has given for being opposed

SENATE
to it. I think it will make for greater unity
among the men in training, the real men
who arc going to fight the battie for civilization. I doubt very much tint anyone in the
world really believes that battle will take
place in Canada. The honourable gentleman
bas referred to the relations between the
thirty-day or four-month trainees and the
men who have signed up for overseas service.
I arn very sorry that the situation as depicted
by the honourable gentleman does not prevail
in Saskatchewan. The trainees there dare nlot
enter the canteen with the men on active
service. The enlisted men refuse to associate
with the trainees on any training field unless
the officers order thema te do so. I think this
amendment, if passed, will make for greater
unity, and I arn perfectly willing to go on
record as supporting it.
Hon. J. H. KING:
Honourable senators,
I do not wish to labour this question, because
it is not a momentous one. 1 concur in the
statement of my honourable leader.
The
subsection under discussion is new; it was not
in the old Act. The reason for it is to be
found in the fact that men who during
their training period sustained in.iury while on
leave were not eligible for a pension, and
cases laid before the parliamentary committee showed that in sucb circumstances great
hardsbips were suffercd by certain individuals
or their families. This enactment does not
give the right of pension to any man who is
injured while off duty; what it doe, is to give
bim, or bis family, if in necossitous circumstances, a right to make an application to the
commission, which after inquiry may, in its
discretion, grant relief. That is ail it means.
Surely we as members of this House realize
that it would be unfair to discriminate against
men who are to-day volunteering to go into
the service or who corne in under enactmnents
passed by this Parliamont. The amount of
money inv olv cd is very sliglht, and any discrimination of the kind I have referred to
would be unwise and most unfortunato.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I arn frankly very much
disappointed that the leader of the Government should have iscen fit to, arraign before the
House as a wvhole the decision of the committee in respect of this amendrnent-and aise the

in most important respects.
Very often I
agreed with the committee's decision, and on

This is not an important amendment in
the sense of going to the moot of any groat
principle, but it bas some importance in that
it is not meroly verbal. I tbink the honourable
leader of the House tried to make plain the
purpose of the amondment, as did also the
honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King). I do net know whether they
succeeded or not. I arn going to do my hest,

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We questioned him ail afternoon. We went into every
phase of the matter; nothing was omitted that
bore on the situation. Inferiorityl We are
in the inferior position liere if there is any
inferiority, because we have not the advantage
of immediate contact witb those ia charge
of the administration. The situation is this.
If I amn wrong I want to ha corrected, but I
think I am right. The general principle of
pensions is that a man who suifers wbile on
service, or as a result of service, is ineured
by the State. Such is the main principle,
practically the central, the paramount priaciple, embodied in our pension law. Such
bas been the principle ail along. But cases
arose in which the suifetriag was not of what

it was under obligation to that man. The
country was under a very special obligation

recognized sucli an obligation or not. I think
we were tlie first ta do so. We said, hecause
of wliat that front-line man undertook ta do,
and did: "We will do sometbing for him on
the basis of a pension, in view of tliat peculiar
obligation."

go somewhat furtber, and even if this pitiable
pligbt wa.s not attributable ta anythiag in
the nature of the service, nevertbeless we
should not see him or his dependents suifer.
The clause under discussion is the expression
of that view. I may be wrong, but it is my
recollection that there was a time before

We undertake to extend our bounty to al
the men wbo are called out for one inonth or

any injury or illness, and are poor enough,
you may apply to this commission." It does
nlot matter whether the injury or accident
arises from service, for a man migbt break
a leg at a dance, and yet be eligible.
Hon. Mr. KING: He is given the right to

is ail.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Ring) was flot
quite rîgbt in bis statement. 11e said a man
would have to be in poverty before be could
apply to the commission. That is not so.
The intent of the subsection, before being
amended by the committee, was that a man
requiring help could apply to the commission.
The commission may grant his request if he
is able to show that be is poor enough.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: May grant it.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is it. And there

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What wou]d
determine the commission's course? It could
not rule out a man because bis injury did
not arise from service, for the subsection is
expressly made ta cover cases of that kind.
So long as a man proved bis need for a
pension, bow could the commission refuse
him? On what prin-ciple? How would you
decide that one man, wbose injury or illness
did not arise from service, yet who is in
sufflciently poor circumstances, shall not get
a pension, whereas another man, equally poor,
shail get one? If seems f0 me the commission

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable muembers, I bave the bonour to bc a member of the
l3anking and Commerce Çommittee, which
discused this mnatter at considerable lengfh.
The vote in committee was a peculiar one.

JIJNE 4, 1941
In fact, I got the shock of my life when'I
heard the Clerk announce the resuit of the
vote. ln the House this afternoon a large
majority of the members are on the Government side, and if they vote as Governrnent
menibers they can carry this amendment. But
let me tell you tbe odd thing that happened
in committec. I know the right honourable
leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
is not awviare of it, because in the committee
rooni he sits near the head of the table and
cannot sec what is going on at the other
end; and the sanie is likely, true of the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), who sits across the table
froni him in committec. A littie confession
is said to be good for one's soul, and if we
confess a little here to-day some honourable
members opposite me may not feel so sure
thnt they should vote against the amendmeot
brought in by the committee. General
McDonald, Chairman of the Pension Commission, was questioned very fully about this
subsection. The effect of the committee's
amendment would be-I will not use the eloquent language of the honourable leader of
the Government or of the right honourable
leader on this side-that a trainee who
încurred an injury or disease when out
of camp and off duty would not corne under
the Act. 'iLhat is ahl it would mean. If he
became injured or diseased while in camp
or on duty, the Act would apply to him. That
is ail there is to it. The amendrnent was
carried in committee by a vote of about 8
to 6. There was an almost equal division,
politically, if I may so put it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That was a
small number of members voting. Yet my
right honourable friend speaks of the solemnity
of the vote.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 0f the six who voted
against the- committee's amendment, two sit
on this side of the House; whereas two, three
or four-I do not remember exactly how
many-of the eight who voted for the amendment are Government supporters. So it was
not a political vote in any sense.
The honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) intimated that members of
the committee did not have an opportunity to
learn what the effeet of the amendment would
be. I disagree with the honourable gentleman
on that. Its effeet was made clear by two,
illustrations. The first was this. A trainee,
while off duty, goes to a dance, falîs down the
trap door of a cellar and breaks his leg. Under
the amendment he could flot get a pension.
A mean who enlisted for overseas service a nd
was inj urcd in similar circumstances could, if
able to prove himself in need,, be given a

pension. The second illustration was this. A
trainee who while off du-ty took an automobile
ride and broke his anm would not be eligible
for a pension; but a man who enlisted for
overseas service and sustained injury while
off duty, in similar cireumstances, could apply
for a pension on compassionate grounds.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is it. The amendment created discrimination.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I agree with the right
honourable leader on this aide (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) that if the Senate performs any
service at aIl to this country it does so in
committee. I would not hold that view if in
this instance there had been a political vote.
As I say, there was nothing of the kind.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Only fourteen
senators voted. in committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the number who
were there. I thought the amendment would
be easily killed, and was shocked when- the
Clerk announced the result.
The mean who volunteers for' overseas service
is in a different position from the trainee. There
is no doubt about that. If at the outset of
the war we had instituted universal service,
as we should have done, it would have been a
different matter. Our people voted against
universal service; so we have not got it. Surely
the man who comes forward and volunteers to
fight overseas or at home, wherever he may be
ordered to go, is in a different position fromn
the mean who is called ont for training.
As to the period of tmining, the Government
changed its policy. First the period was thirty
days. I remember well that certain honýourable members of this Huse said thirty days'
training would prove to be no good, and that
a 'change would have to be made. Well, it did
not take long to prove that. Men are being
called out now for four months' training, eand
they are required teo continue in service
afterwards.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: That does not prove the
former systemn waa no good.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will not argue that
point with my honourable friend. Apparently the Government thought it was no good.
or the period would not have been exten'ded
to four months. The Government's hope,
which. I trust is well founded, is that most of
the men, after completing four months' training, will volunteer for service. I understood
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
to say that 70 per cent have already indicated
their readiness to volunteer.
That may
justify the present system. The minute a
sean volunteers, this amendment would not
apply to him at all.

192

SENATE

I submit to honourable members that if the
Senate is to be of any use in our parliamentary
system we should not reject the findings made
by a committee after full discussion and
inquiry, such as were had in this case.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
senators, like the honourable junior member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), who has
just sat down, I am a member of the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. I am
one of those to whom, I think, he was
probably referring when he mentioned the
fact that three members on this side of the
HouseHon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know how many;
I thought it was three.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It was three, I
think-voted in favour of the amendment.
Well, I so voted, but I am free to say that
upon reconsideration I think I was wrong,
and I shall change my vote this afternoon.
I voted for the amendment with considerable hesitation, but it did not seem to me
to be a matter of any great importance. The
section which we were considering provides
that, in a case where in the ordinary course
a member of the forces would not be entitled
to a pension, the Pension Commission may
in its discretion grant a pension if it is shown
that he bas incurred an injury or d'isease while
on service, but not while actually in training,
and that he is in necessitous circumstances,
or, in the case of bis death, that bis widow
and children are in necessitous circumstances.
The proposed amendment provided that this
special consideration should not apply to
trainees who are now undergoing four months'
training under the Natural Resources Mobilization Act. As honourable mem.bers will
realize, those trainees are young men of
twenty-one and twenty-two years of age, for
the most part unmarried, and with no
dependents. I d4id not believe that it made
very much difference one way or the other
whether they were allowed to corne under
this subsection or not. That is still my belief,
notwithstanding the impassioned appeal which
we have heard from the right honourable
leader on the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) for protection of the finances of
the country.
Now let me state quite frankly the reason
which bas led me to change my miind. It bas
been represented to me that the present
scheme of military training is specifically
designed to produce a united Canadian army,
irrespective of whether a man bas enlisted
solely for home service under the Militia
Act or bas volunteered for service overseas.
With that object in view, all the training
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

camps, both preliminary and advanced, contain the two categories: voluntary enlistments for overseas, and trainees. They train
together, side by side, sleep in the same
lodgements, take part in the same amusements
and undergo the same training. In a word,
every attempt is being made to raise, not
two Canadian armies, but one, a part of
which will be available for overseas service,
and the other part for the defence of our
coasts. And who, at this stage of the war,
will tell me that the time may not come very
soon-sooner than any of us expect-when a
man defending the coasts of this country will
be on active service and under fire? Under
these conditions it was represented to me that
this Parliament would be making an invidious
distinction if, in effect, it said, "We are going
to make fish of one and flesh of another; we
are going to distinguish between you in one
category and you in another category." The
whole object of the training, as I have said,
is to make a united Canadian army.
That, honourable members, is a circumstance which was entirely absent from my
mind yesterday afternoon, because our consideration of the Bill in the Banking and
Commerce Committee had nothing to do with
it. That, I confess, is what bas made me
change my mind, and therefore I shall vote
contrary to the way I voted in the committee.
For that reason, and for that reason alone,
I shall vote against the amendment.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I now move that
the Senate do not concur in the first amendment in the report presented by the chairman

of the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
and I desire to read a memorandum in favour
of the motion.
By -the amendments to the Pension Act passed
in 1930, the Federal Appeal Board-which had
existed since 1923-was abolished, and the Board
of Pension Commissioners continued.
Up to this time no provision had been made
for any retiring allowance or superannuation
for any members of either of these bodies.
The amendments of this year besides continuing the Board of Pension dommissioners,
created the Pension Tribunal and the Pension
Appeal Court. This enactment contained the
following provisions:
"10D. (1) The Governor in Council, upon the
retirement of any member of the commission,
or of the Pension Tribunal or the Pension
Appeal Court, who has served upon one or other
of such bodies during at least twenty years, or
who has so served during at least ten ycars
and bas reached the age of seventy years, or is
physically or mentally incapacitated, may grant
to him a pension for his life not exceeding onethird of the salary to which he was entitled
as such member.
"(2) For the purpose of this section, service
as a judge appointed by the Governor in Couneil
prior ýto appointment as a member of the
Pension Tribunal or of the Pension Appeal
Court shall count as service as a member of
such tribunal or court as the case may be,
provided that if any such member would have
become entitled to a greater pension or retiring
allowance under any other statute if be had
continued as such judge during his service on
the tribunal or court, he may be granted such
greater pension or retiring allowance in lieu
of the pension by this*section provided."
No change was made in this by the amendments of 1931.
The amending Act of 1933 replaced the Board
of Pension Commissioners by the Canadian
Pension Commission and continued the Pension
Appeal Court, but abolished the Pension
Tribunal.
The Act contained the following provision:
"10B. (1) The Governor in Council upon the
retirement of any member of the commission, or
the court, who bas served upon one or other of
such bodies or as a member of the Board of
Pension Commissioners of Canada or of the
Pension Tribunal, during at least twenty years,
or who bas so served during at least ten years
and bas reached the age of seventy years, or is
physioally or mentally incapacitated, and is not
entitled to superannuation under the Civil
Service Superannuation Act, may grant to him
a pension for his life not exceeding one-third
of the salary to which he was entitled as such
member."
Section 9 of the Act now reads as follows:
"9. (1) The Governor in Council upon the
retirement of any member of the Commission,
or the Court, who bas served upon one or other
of such bodies or as a member of the Board of
Pension Commissioners for Canada or of the
Pension Tribunal, during at least twenty years,
or who bas so served during at least ten years

As honourable members of the Senate will
see, the Bill as it came before us added the
Federal Appeal Board and allowed the period
during which a member had sat on that board
to be counted in the fixing of his pension.
Members of all the other boards, which were
replaced one after another, had the same privilege; so there is no reason why a judge who
has sat on the Federal Appeal Board should
not have his time counted when the measure
of his pension is being fixed.
¯ This matter was discussed in the committee,
and the result is now before us. Committee
proceedings usually have no echo in this
Chamber, but I think I am frce t say that
the recommendation hardly represents the
opinion of the committee, which is composed
of forty-five or fifty members, as there were
but fourteen members sitting around the table.
I move, therefore, that the Senate do net
concur in the first amendment.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it is my duty to put the
facts as I see them before the House. I
do so most reluctantly, feeling that the effort
is perfectly worthless and the time occupied
simply wasted.
The clause struck out by the committee
looks innocent enough, but it was inserted
for the benefit of one man, Mr. Clifford B.
Reilly, who is intended to be the recipient
of some further bounty from this country.

Well, I
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
declare! What an interruption for a leader
of this House! I presume if the Government
had not been changed it would have appointed
him to some other position.
No; to the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
next board.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Maybe so.
What has that to do with it? Nothing whatever. Any honourable member who admits
that to his mind either does not honestly
try to follow the facts as they appertain to
the issue, or is incapable of doing so. It
has nothing whatever to do with the facts.
He sued the Government because he d.id not
get paid for the unexpired portion of his
term. The reason why there was an unexpired
portion was that Parliament, on the recommendation of the Government of the dayand I make no criticism in this respectabolished his office. He failed in the trial
court, in the Supreme Court and- in the
Privy Council. All three tribunals held that
the country owed him nothing.
What happened next? Later a new Government came into office, the King Government.
Another Act was passed, abolishing the
tribunals created by the 1930 law, which that
same Government had put through, and
establishing another tribunal. I empbasize the
fact that the same Govemment was in office
as in 1930; but again I make no criticism. That
is not the issue. Let us assume that what
was done was in the publie interest and right.
To the new tribunal Mr. Reilly was appointed
at a salary of $6,000 a year. Prior to this
appointment the sum of $100,000 had been
voted by item No. 298 of the supplementary
estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1935. I quote from the item itself:
To provide for gratuities to former members
of the Pension Tribunal and the Federal Appeal
Board, subject to allocation by the Treasury
Board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What date?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: March 31,
1935. That would be under the Government
of Mr. Bennett. A vote of $100,000 was made
to provide gratuities to men whose positions
had been abolished. Parliament was under
no obligation to make that vote. If any
of it was intended to go to Mr. Reilly, the
vote to that extent at least had no support
from the judgments of the courts, which had
held that nothing was owing to him. But
evidently the Parliament and the Government
of the day felt they ought to be bounteous,
as Parliaments nearly always are to those right
near them, and they granted $100,000. Of that
sum $4,165 was allocated by the Treasury
Board, in accordance with the terms of the
vote, to Mr. Reilly.
14879-13,1

195

Hon. Mr. KING: His services were discontinued in 1930, and in 1935 he was paid
$4,165?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I ask
the House to forget for the moment that he
was later on appointed to another position.
Would honourable members feel that we still
owed Mr. Reilly some money? He worked
sevei years, at an annual salary of $6,000. No
pension was attached to his position, and there
was no understanding that he would get one.
The courts held there was no damage because
his office was abolished. But Parliament, in
its bounty, decided notwithstanding to pay
him something, and he was paid $4,165. Does
any honourable member feel that in respect
of his past service there was still some money
due to him?
Well, Mr. Reilly was appointed to another
position. And as provision is being made for
payment of pensions to him and other
appointees, there is inserted in an Act a clause
to increase Mr. Reilly's pension because of
service rendered on the Appeal Board long
ago. For pension purposes he is to be allowed
to count his period of service on that tribunal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
members of the other boards.

Like all the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The

to them. Neither should he.

UNEMPLOY MENT INSURANCE BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

NEGATIVED

The Senate resumed from Monday, June 2,
the adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill E3, an Act to amend
the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I listened with much pleasure to the speeches
made the other night on the motion for
second readiug of this Bill. I am afraid that
the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) attached too much
importance to the purpose of the amending
section. It would simply empower the commission to collect information and data from
time to time and report thereon.
I have in my hand an editorial which
appeared on Monday of this week in what I
may term one of the leading newspapers of
Canada, the Winnipeg Free Press. It was
written apparently by one of the members of
the Sirois Commission. A perusal of that
editorial would, I believe, lead one to the
same conclusion that I reached on studying
that part of the Sirois report dealing with the
subject of national health. I do not wish to
weary honourable members by reading the
It simply intimates that this

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

form of social insurance will certainly come
after the war, if it is not adopted sooner.
I was surprised at the attitude taken by
the honourable leader of the Government
when he opposed the Bill. As he then pointed
out, the Sirois report recommends that matters
of this sort should be left with the provinces.
But there is nothing in this amending Bill
at variance with that recommendation. The
sole purpose of the measure is to ensure
an authoritative survey of the whole of Canada
with respect to a scheme of health insurance.
I do not intend to pursue this matter
further. I would suggest that the Bill be
passed. Its acceptance would not imply the
introduction of any new principle, for the very
same principle has already been adopted by
the Parliament of Canada. It is not proposed
that health insurance shall be dealt with
under the Dominion Act, the sole intent of
the Bill being, as I have said, to provide
that the Unemployment Insurance Commission
shall co-operate with other authorities in the
Dominion or the provinces for the purpose
of collecting information, so that the people
of Canada may come to a proper conclusion
in the premises.
I move that the Bill be given second reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thought that
last Monday I submitted so convincing a
memorandum that my honourable friend
might withdraw his motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.

The motion was negatived.
DIVORCE JURISDICTION BILL
AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

Hon. Mr. TANNER moved concurrence in
the amendment made by the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Privute Bills to Bill
N2, an Act to amend the Divorce Jurisdiction
Act. 1930.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON moved the third
reading of the Bill.
He said: This Bill was introduced by the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Copp), and he bas asked me to look after
it in his absence.

197

JUNE 4, 1941
As amended, the Bill provides that a deserted
wife, before bringing action for divorce against
her husband in the courts of a province other
than that of her husband's domicile, must
have resided in such province separate and
apart from lier husband for not less than two
years immediately preceding the date of the
commencement of legal .proceedings.
As honourable members are aware, under
our law the domicile of the wife is controlled
by the husband. This prevents lier from
instituting divorce proceedings except in the
province where lier husband is domiciled.
The purpose of this Bill is to give to the
woman, in respect of domicile, the same
privilege as that nuow enjoyed by the man.
For instance, to-day a man may make his
domicile at Churchill or any other remote
place., and although lie has deserted his wife,
yet under our present law her domicile is
controlled by his. This Bill applies only to
cases of desertion, and it does seem to me to
be a reasonable measure.
I move third reading of the Bill as
amended.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, I am
not at all satisfied with the amendment which
the Private Bills Committee has reported to
this House. In my opinion the amendment
has not remedied the defect in the Bill as
originally introduced. A married couple in
Ontario, we will say, have quarrelled and the
husband has apparently deserted his wife, and
while she is still living in the province his
conduct is such as might entitle lier to a
dlivorce. After knowledge of this has come to
the wife she continues to reside there for
another year, and has ample opportunity to
prosecute her right of action before an
Ontario tribunal, which during that year
would be the court of both husband and wife.
But she chooses not to do se. A year later,
for reasons of lier own, or possibly for some
good reason, she goes to British Columbia
and takes up residence. Then she decides to
apply for a divorce. Under this Bill as
amended, after two years' residence in the
province of British Columbia she can institute
an action in that province against her husband,
who is in Ontario. I say this procedure is
very unfair. She should have started her
action long before, in the province of Ontario,
when she was residing there. What is proposed here is against every principle regulating
the jurisdiction of courts and the rights of
litigants in the courts. In no other cause of
action can the civil courts of any province
assert jurisdiction under such circumstances.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I beg my honourable friend's pardon.

Hon. Mr. COTE: I am afraid the interruption of the honourable gentleman indicates
that I have not made my point quite clear.
I am not going to try to make it any clearer
than I have done. I have pointed out one
weakness in this amended Bill which certainly
forces me to vote against it.
On the general merits of the Bill I must
admit candidly that I have no desire to see a
change made in the general jurisprudence
respecting the jurisdiction of the courts in
order to place an action for divorce in a
special and privileged class. I shall vote
against the Bill.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, after considering this Bill from all
possible angles, I am unable to vote for it.
I agree with what the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) says with
reference to jurisdiction.
I should also like to say that in my opinion
the present law of Canada imposes no particular hardship on a woman who is seeking
a divorce from lier husband.

Prior to the

amendment of 1930 the woman probably was
under a handicap, but that amendment gave
lier the right to take action in the province of
the matrimonial domicile, even though the
husband had deserted lier and possibly had
established a domicile in some other place.
In my opinion the Bill as drafted would
work a hardship on the deserted wife in such
a case as I am going to mention. Let us
suppose that a marriage takes place in New
Brunswick. After some years the husband
deserts the wife and moves to Nova Scotia.
The wife then changes lier residence to Vancouver, in the province of British Columbia,
where she resides for two years. She then
decides to take action for divorce against her
husband. If she does this she is obliged to
bring all lier witnesses from the province of
Nova Scotia te the province of British
Columbia in order to prove her case. This,
it seems to me, would be a greater hardship

on the wife than it would be for lier to take
lier action in the beginning, say, in Nova
Scotia.
Now let me take the husband's side of the
same case. He may be perfectly innocent of
the charge made against him by ,his wife.
Then, even though lie may be in straitened
circumstances, he will be compelled to take
his witnesses all the way to British Columbia
in order to defend himself; and when the
hiearing is over, whether the wife has made out
a good case against him or not-it may be
that she has failed in lier action-the court
in British Columbia can give judgment against
him for costs. which wniil'

includP not. nnly

SENATE
his own costs, incurred in transporting himself and his witnesses to British Columbia,
but those incurred by his wife in bringing ber
witnesses before the court.
It seems to me that the Bill is not necessary
at the present time; I do not think it will
be of very much benefit to the wife; and in
my opinion it is bad legislation.

In answer to the assertion of the honourable
senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté)
that in no province to-d'ay is this principle
recognized, I may say that we had in New
Brunswick a law-I think it is still on the
Statute Book-which sought to give to a
woman the right to sue, regardless of where
her husband might live.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, two or three lawyers have now
spoken. I am not a lawyer, but I am a
member of the Divorce Committee, and I am
a little at sea in trying to understand what is
contemplated here. As I understand it, with
the amendment made by the Private Bills
Committee, section 2 would read this way:
-at the suit of a married woman who lias
resided in such province separate and apart
from her husband for not less than two years
immedia'tely preceding the date of the commencement of such action or proceeding and on any
grounds of entitlement to such divorce provided
by the law of the province in which such court
is constituted.

Hon. Mr.
Manitoba.

As I understand it, this does not mean that
a woman from Ontario can go to British
Columbia, live there for two years as a
deserted wife, and then get a divorce because
of the desertion.

HAIG:

Hon. Mr. COTE: I was referring to civil
cases.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: As I see it, this is
not a matter of very serious importance. I
am sponsoring the Bill in the absence of the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Copp) because I think it is a just one.
I move the third read-ing.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
on the third reading of this Bill. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. COTE: No.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: She has to show
reason under the law of the province of
British Columbia why she is entitled to a
divorce. Am I correct in that understandýing?
This does not change the law of any province
as regards entitlement. Presumably the wife
has to prove adultery in most of the provinces.
Am I right?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In all.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I have no personal
interest in this Bill, but I have no objection
to sponsoring it, because I believe it is just.
It gives to the wife greater privileges than
she has had heretofore. At the present time
she is regarded practically as a chattel of the
man. Her domicile is the domicile of the
husband. This Bill applies only in case of
desertion, and I do not think the husband
who deserts his wife deserves very much
compassion from anybody. He starts out on
the wrong foot. What we are trying to do is
to give the poor wife an equal right with the
husband. As a matter of fact, the Bill does
not give ber equal privileges with the husband,
because she cannot sue until she has resided
in a province for two years, whereas he can
establsh domicile in two minutes. All he has
to do is to go to some place and assert his
intention of remaining there. That settles
the whole question.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

NATURAL RESOURCES TRANSFER BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 60, an Act to amend
the Alberta Natural Resources Act
The Bill was read the first time.

JUNE 5, 1941
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND, with leave
of the Senate, moved the second reading of
the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I intend first
to read the explanatory notes to be found
on the right-hand side of the first page.
They are as follows:
In 1912 the Calgary Power Company was
given the right to construet a dam at the
outlet of Lake Minnewanka in Banff National
Park with right to store 44,000 acre feet of
water.
Following the decision to ereet a
nitrogen plant at Calgary for war purposes,
the company in November, 1940, applied for
permission to increase the water storage
capacity to 200,000 acre feet and to construct
and operate a hydro-electric plant in the park
for the operation of the nitrogen plant.
As the plans of the power company to develop
such additional storage involved the diversion
of waters outside the park boundaries, and as
the park was situated within Alberta, the
application was submitted to the Provincial
Government, who approved of it being granted.
The Natural Resources Transfer Agreement does
net contemplate developments of this nature
being permitted in national parks and it was
deemed advisable to enter into the formal agreement referred to in the schedule hereto.
As it was planned te have the plant of the
nitrogen company ready for operation on September 1, 1941, it was therefore of the utmost
importance that an adequate supply of electric
power be available as soon as possible. To
prevent delay in completing the power expansion works, tentative permission was given to
the power company under the War Measures
Act to commence construction pending and
subject to approval by Parliament and the
Alberta Legislature.
The Bill consists of three clauses, as follows:
1. This Act may be cited as The Natural
Resources Transfer (Amendment) Act, 1941.
2. The agreement set out in the Schedule to
this Act is confirmed and shall have and take
effect according te the respective terms thereof.
3. The Minister of Mines and Resources shall
have authority to grant the licence referred te
in the said agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of the National Parks Act, chapter
thirty-three of the statutes of 1930 (First
Session).
I have just happened on a statement by the
Minister, who seemed to be concluding a
long debate. It appears at page 3776, and
is as follows:
I shall detain the House only a very few
minutes. The suggestion or claim has been
made in the course of the debate that this is
not a war measure, that there is something
almost sinister behind the business of granting
to the Calgary Power Company the right to
store water in lake Minnewanka. Let me make
it unequivoeally clear that this is a war measure.
If I had not been convinced that it is necessary
to provide continuous power for the development of an ammonium nitrate industry very
much needed for the production of munitions,

199

I would not have made the recommendation to
my colleagues that this measure be proceeded
with. And I am quite sure that the Government
would not have approved the measure. Let
there be no misunderstanding about that.
The honourable member for Bow River (Mr.
Johnston) seemed to argue on both sides of
the question.
I rather gathered from the
remarks of the honourable member for Mackenzie (Mr. Nicholson) that he was in a somewhat similar position. The honourable member
for Bow River stated that the Calgary Power
Company was a subsidiary of the Beauharnois
company. It is not my business here te deal
with either the virtues or the iniquities of power
companies, but I can assure the honourable
member for Bow River that there is no connection whatever between the Calgary Power
Company and the Beauharnois company. As a
matter of fact, in their own fields in other
parts of Canada I understand that there is a
good deal of rivalry between them.
The honourable member for Mackenzie also
made the suggestion that we should let the
matter stand, that we should not proceed with
this measure until the war is over. That as
a practical matter is quite impessible. The
outlay by the company for these works will be
almost $2,400,000. Even in these days that is a
considerable sum of money, and if a company
asked the public or its shareholders to supply
this amount of money for a development of
this kind on the assumption that after the war
they would get some authority te continue it,
it would be impossible for them to et the
money. There can be no question about that
in the mind of any reasonable person who is
aware of the facts. The matter is one of war
emergency, and I repeat that is the only reason
it is before the House.
The honourable member for Témiscouata (Mr.
Pouliot) is, I think, under a misapprehension,
if I understood his remarks correctly. There
is no proposal in this measure te pay $240,000
te the Calgary Power Company or anyone
associated with it. The Government sells its
present power plant and distribution system in
the town of Banff te the Calgary Power Company. That distribution system and the power
plant cost $240,000, and we get from the
Calgary Power Company the depreciated value
of the plant. The basis of arriving at the
amount of depreciation bas to be agreed upon
between the Government and the company. In
addition the company pays te the Government
$100,000 over and above what it pays for the
depreciated value of the plant, and on top of
that, as I have stated, the Government is
assured of 500,000 kilowatt hours of electrical
energy free of cost, its additional requirements
at half a cent a kilowatt hour, and the citizens
of Banff are assured of their light and power
requirements at rates no greater than they are
paying at the present time and under conditions
subject te review by the Public Utilities Board
of Alberta when they wish te have them
reviewed. In that respect I think we have
effectively protected the people of the town
of Banff.
There I stop, without delving further into
the debate that took place in the other
House. I shall listen with interest to my
right honourable friend's statemcnt.

Hon. Senator Graham, that Bill 60, an Act
to amend the Alberta Natural Resources Act,

honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did net get a chance
to speak when I wanted te, which was on
the motion for second reading. I waited until
I saw that the right honourable leader on
this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) did net
want te say anything, and then, before I
had time to make my voice heard, His Honour

I confess that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my eyes were riveted on my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He may be a very
important member, but there are still one or
two others on this side of the House. I reserve
my rights by objecting to third reading at
this time. The Bill will now go over te

to that motion and since he said he had
intended to speak to the motion for second
reading, he can address himself to the principle of the Bill, if it has any principle. We
shall listen with considerable interest to what
my honourable friend bas to say.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Do I understand that the honourable senator desires to
speak on the motion for third reading?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I will use other
means. I object to the Bill being read the
third time now.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the honourable senator move adjournment of the
debate?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not move. As I
understand it, the rules provide that unless
there is unanimous consent, a motion for
third reading cannot be made without at least
one day's notice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is absolutely right. If anyone objects
to the motion for third reading being made
now, the motion will have to be postponed
until another sitting.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will speak now, as I
may not be present later. I do not like this
legislation. It interferes with one of the
finest parks in Canada. The Calgary Power
Company's request for this thing is net new
at all; they have been after it for years. I
seriously object to our public parks being
turned over for mercantile use. Future generations in this country will look with disgust
upon entry into the Banff park for the
purpose covered by this Bill. In the circumstances I do not think it was at all necessary
to grant the company's request. My information is that it was not necessary as a war
measure. If that be se, then to grant it is
unfair to the whole of Canada. It must be
remembered that it is not the province of
Alberta alone which has to be considered,
for national parks are owned by the Dominion.
One of the finest assets this country bas today is the Banff National Park, and when
hard surfaced highways have been built across
Western Canada into the Rockies it will
prove te be a very popular tourist attraction.
Those of us who saw the national park over
thirty-seven years ago can appreciate what
a wonderful place it is. Again I protest against
our national parks being used in this way.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I confess that
I am net sufficiently au fait with the local
topography. I must rely on the fact that
the Government of the province of Alberta,
which undoubtedly bas some interest in preserving the beauties of the park, bas agreed te

201

JUNE 5, 1941
this project as a necessary improvement. So,
as against the objection of my honourable
friend, who lives a considerable distance from
the park, I must accept the view of the people
of Alberta, as represented by their Government. As honourable members are aware, the
plant is under construction and the power
company requires the additional storage in
order to develop extra power.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is the position
so far as the plant is concerned? From what
has been said I infer that a contract has
been let for the building of a plant for certain
war purposes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is nearly finished.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Then the matter is
settled. If a mistake was made it was made
by the Government in locating the plant at
Calgary, where there is not sufficient power
available for its operation. However, if a
contract has been let and the- plant constructed to manufacture something necessary
for war purposes, we may as well stop
talking.
On that point
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
also I must confess my ignorance. I do not
know the reason why a contract was given
for the building of the plant at Calgary.

coal within the province. Probably onefourteenth of the coal reserves of the world
is to be found in Alberta. We have not many
scenie beauty spots in the Prairie Provinces,
and this makes it all the more important that
our park system, which has been developed
by both the Dominion and the provincial governments, should be guarded against encroachment. Once more I protest against any further
encroachment on these parks for any purpose
whatever. That is the basis of my criticism.
Then I preHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
sume this Bill may be given third reading on
the strength of my honourable friend's statement that this shall not constitute a precedent
for similar action in other parks.

There may be a

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I do
not know anything about the necessity of the
power expansion for this plant. It may be
necessary or may not' be. If it is, that is
regrettable. But I do know the Government
has no excuse whatever for bringing this
matter to us as a fait accompli. It is just
another -instance of the contempt of Parliament which we are witnessing day by day,
The legislation comes before us now; the agreement was made on March 28. This House
was in session a month before that. For the

party election, Parliament was suddenly and

something already done, and we are told, when
it is too late to do anything but make a

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I cannot tell

United States, but every time you depreciate
the beauty of these national parks you tend
to discourage that traffic, and it is a very
important source of revenue. On general
principles I protest against our national parks
being used for mercantile purposes. The plant
could get an ample supply of gas from the
Turner Valley, and there is an abundance of

right honourable friend has not covered the
whole ground. Any delay in coming to Parliament was due to the discussions with the
Alberta Government to obtain its assent to
the proposal. But we are faced with the
necessity for the development of power, and
I think this requirement has the approval of
my right honourable friend.

PRAIRIE FARM REHABILITATION BILL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND, with leave of the
Senate, moved the third reading of the Bill.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Can the
Minister tell us what, if any, rehabilitation
of prairie farms has actually taken place under
the tremendous expenditure made, and being
made, under this Act, except what has occurred
by process of nature?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not in a
position to give a statement of what has been
donc under the Act. I think I had occasion
to presebt to this House, or at all events to
read myself, a lengthy report of the activities
of the department in this connection.
I
realized then that many things had been done
to help the farmers of the West who were in
a sorry plight because of drought, dust storms,
and lack of water and transport. I could
procure that report and enlarge upon what
has since been done.
The purpose of this Bill is to allow the
Minister to proceed with works involving an
expenditure not exceeding $5,000 without first
securing approval of the Governor in Couneil.
It is purely an oversight that a similar provision was not embodied in the original Act.
The Publie Works Department is governed
by statutory regulations which prohibit the
Minister of that department from entering
into a contract of $5,000 or more without an
Order in Council. Under the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act the Minister of Agriculture
finds himself obliged to get authorization to
spend even $100. This measure would give
him freedom of action in dealing with important and necessary projects which come within
the $5,000 limitation. The clause reads:
The Minister may,
(a) subject to section 4 of this Act, undertake
the development, construction, promotion,
operation and maintenance of any project
or scheme under or by virtue of this Act,
or enter into agreements with any province, municipality or person with respect
thereto: provided that if the total amount
to be expended under any single project
or scheme under this section exceeds
$5,000 in any fiscal year, the approval of
the Governori in Council shall be required;
(b) pay all necessary administrative expenses
ineurred under the Act and all necessary
travelling and living expenses incurred
by officials or employees in performance
of their duty.
The section, as amended, will facilitate
administration of the Act and give the necessary leeway to that end.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

DOMINION SUCCESSION

DUTY

BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented the committee's report on
Bill 79, an Act te authorize the levying of
Duties in respect of Successions.
He said: Honourable senators, the conmittee held two sessions for the study of this
Bill. Various suggestions were made by difforent members of the committee respecting
changes which might be necessary to the
proper working of the measure. Perhaps the
two principal objections raised were, first,
to section 16, as to which it was suggested
that the word "shall" was presumably mandatory and that the word "may" should be
substituted. Then again, as te Part VII,
which provides for prohibitions and penallties,
some of the menibers of the committee
thought the penalty for misrepresentation as
te the declared value of an estate for succession duty purposes excessive, inasmuch as
it is twice the total amount of the assessment
for duty. The Inspecter of Insurance was
present at the meetings, and lie was requested
to think this matter over during the evening
and report back to the committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg the bonourable gentleman's pardon. It is net the
Inspecter of Insurance.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I should have said
the Commissioner of Income Tax, Mr. Elliott.
He agreed te do that, and when he appeared
before the committee last night he stated
that this provision would not in any case be
enforced immediately, and he asked the members of the committee to allow the Bill to

JUNE 5, 1941
pass withaut change, assuriog them that if,
aiter the first year ai aperation ai the law,
changes were iound ta be necessary', the
Minister would corne ta Parliameat and
request the required amendments. He alsa
assured the committee that sa lang as he was
Commissioner ai Income Tax the word
"shahl" should ha interpreted as maaning
"miay". He iurthar stated that in his opinion
the penalties were nat fao severe for iraud,
but if they praved ta be s0 they toa would
ba arnended, and hie braught a message irom
the Minister ai Finance-the leader of the
Hlouse was there-asserting the willingness ai
the Goveronent ta ahide by this assurance.
Therciare the camrnittee has reported the
Bill withaut amendrnent.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Hanaurable
senators, I should like ta have the apinion
ai the honourable leader ai the House in
regard ta section 15. 1 understand irarn what
bas been said by the honaurable gentleman
who bas just presented the repart ai the cammittee <Hon. Mr. Black) that the penalty
for failure ta makce full disclasure in a returo
ta the Goveroment will ha hasad anly an
the undisclosed arnount and nat the total of
the succession.
Han. Mr. HAIG: That is clause 16.
Han. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes, clause 16.
1 should like the honourable leader ai the
Hanse ta make that abunclantly clear, hecause
the public are interested in this, as wa al
know, and would appreciate a very clear and
definite pronauncement.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: There bas been
same divergence ai opinion on the meaning
ai this clause, and same question as ta
whether it may nat ha susceptible ai two interpretations. I may say that I examined it
closely with the Cammnissianer, Mr. Eilio>tt,
and we concluded that the penalty ai "ane
hund-red per centum. ai the amaunt ai the
duty levied in respect ai the succession ta
sucb property" reierrad ta the undisclosed
property and nat ta the general assets ai the
estate.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The undisclased
amaunt only.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, the undisclosed amount anly. Here is the clause:
If ýany persan required ta file a statement
pursuant ta section fiteen of this Act amits
ta disclase any property inciudad in a succession
which sbanld have been sa disclosed, the persan
fihing the statament ï3hail be hiabla ta pay ta the
Recaiver General af Canada as a penalty an
amaunt equal ta ana hundred per cantum af
the amaunt of the duty leviad iii respect af the
succession ta such property.
1487-14

203

The words "to such property" can refer only
to, the property whichf has flot been reported,
and wh-ich, in the words of the first phrase of
the section, 'is undisclosed.
The Commissianer stated that as amendment after amendment fallowed the enactment af such legislation in Great Britain and
the United States, the Minister would
undoubtedly return to Parliament at the next
session to suggest some amendments, that
these would cantain a very clear pronouncement along the lines I have just indicated,
and that in this way an endeavour would be
made ta assure the publie that penalties
which were deemed unconscionable by some
members ai the cornmittee--I will admit I
was one ai them-would he sa tempered as
ta satisly equîty and: the public conscience. a
Hua. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I want ta
thýaak the honourable leader for his statement.
I think I understand himn correctly. This Act
is gaing ino effeet immediately aiter the
Royal Assent, 1 take it. I understand, then,
that in relation ta those wha pass away
between now and next, session, and their
executors, the one hundred per cent wil
apply ta the amaunt wiliully lait undisclased,
and ta nathing mare.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: Absolutely.
Hon. JOHIN T. HAIG: Honaurable senators, the drafteman ai this Bull lias evidently
been used ta drafting measures wh-ich impose
heavy penalties an persans who have knowledge af the facts they are obliged ta report.
For instance, the Customs Act impases some
very drastie penalties on the persan wha,
when making an unsatisfactary return, bas
knowledge ai the facts. The same is true af
the incarne tax law. The penalties apply ta
persans or campanies ta whomn the iact8 are
known. The same system is used in the
drafting af this Bill, althaugh in the matter
ai succession duties there is an entirely
different situation. That is my firat criticismn
ai the Bill. The executar or admînîstratar,
as the -case rnay ha, frequently has na
personal knowledge whatever ai the facts.
Those ai us Who engage in the practice ai law
know that men are sametimes surprised ta
find th-at they have been appointed executars
ai an estate.
Secondly, as was pointed out hy sevaral
members ai the carnmittee, in the wvording ai
section 16 there shauld ha an amendment.
The word "shahl" should ha changed ta "mnay,"
and sorna discretian should be allowed ta
either the Minister ar the Commissioner ai
Succession Duties. In actual practice in aur
provinces-I cao speak with persona] knowledge ai only two-the superintendent or the

SENATE
head of succession duties collection has very
wide powers. I have every confidence that so
long as the present Commissioner of Income
Tax is at the head of this department no
drastic penalties will be inflicted except in
case of fraud.
I have been taught that Parliament should
not pass legislation knowing that it requires
amendment; and, if this House has any function to perforn in accordance with our Constitution, it is to revise legislation and see
that it contains no provisions which we as
legislators know should not be there. I well
remember someone in the Manitoba Legislature raising objection to a statute and receiving
the reply, "Well, let the judges decide." To
a imited degree that is like what is being
done in this case.
If a penalty is imposed, there is no appeal
from it. Under section 16 you can go to
court and review the proceedings, and if the
court is satisfied that there was no intentional
misrepresentation there will be no liability. I
think section 36 should be so amended as ta
give a right of appeal on the amount of the
penalty. There is very good precedent in our
Criminal Code as ta the fixing of a maximum
penalty, although under the liquor laws, I
think, the judge is not permitted to exorcise
any discretion.
Then there is something omitted which
should be included in the Bill. In succession
duty work the problem is not in the failure
to disclose all the assets.
In ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred there are assets about
which the executor and the solicitors for the
executor know nothing. You must remember
that many people do not keep books or full
records. I think a good deal of attention
should be given to this side of the picture.
In the settling of estates most trouble is
caused w-ben the deceased has left property
in some province or provinces other than
the one in which he resided. The difficulty
is to get at a corresponding basis of valuation
in each province. I should have liked to see
the Bill made much wider. In my opinion
it ought to have made the reaching of agreement on valuation not merely permissible, but
compulsory.
The Bill contains many provisions I do like.
I like section 35, which provides that once
you get your certificate you are discharged
froa any further claim, unless fraud is proved
against you. A certificate of that kind is
final. Unfortunately this cannot be said of
the certificate that is given by one of our
largest provinces.
A certificate from that
province does not mean that the business is
settled; it is just a start, and there seems to
lon. Mr. HAIG.

be no end to the matter. I compliment the
draftsman of this Bill upon the insertion of
such a sterling clause as section 35. I predict
there will be a lot of difficulty, however, in
making valuation where the deceased man
lad property in more than his own province.
I wish the Dominion Government had left
the succession duty field alone altogether.
I realize, though, that money is needed for
the purpose of financing the war, and that
one way to get some is to tax successions.
However, I think this is a provincial field
which should never have been invaded by the
Dominion. I do not hold the same view with
regard to income tax and corporation tax. My
opinion is that the successions tax can be
handled better by the provinces.
As the chairman of the committee has
reported, we suggested amendments, but the
Minister indicated, through the Commissioner
of Income Tax, that the Government did not
feel like agreeing to any amendment. The
Commissioner said that in the course of
the next six or eight months there would
be another session of Parliament, at which
any difficulties encountered in the working of the Act could be ironed out. That
is well and good, and I have no reason to
believe it wilil not be done. But I say that we
as legislators should never place on the
Statute Book of this Dominion an Act such
as this. With the power given him by this
measure the Commissioner could do as he
liked, and in comparison the actions of the
administrator in any province would seem
like child's play. I protest as vehemently as
I can against being a party to any such legislation. This is just the thin edge of the
wedge of bureaucracy making its way into our
country. It is a challenge to free democractic
institutions. When the civil service runs the
country, and when we as members of the
Senate or of the House of Commons have no
right to challenge the actions of a bureaucracy, it is time to call a halt. I repeat that
we should never permit such legislation to be
placed upon the Statute Book of this country.
I suggest that next time this subject is dealt
with the Government should introduce the
bill in the Senate, which would have the time
to review it. Here it would be considered
fron a standpoint, not of politics, but of what
is in the best interest of the country.
Nothing causes more trouble than the
administering of wills and the transferring of
property from the deceased ta the heirs.
After this Bill is passed the probating of wills
will be more costly. I am referring, not to
the increase in succession duties themselves,
but to the extra cost of doing the business.
My criticisms of this Bill are not based on
any personal grounds, or made against the

'

JUNE 5, 1941

Commissioner or the Minister.
They are
based, first, on the general principle that we
should not pass legislation which in our heart
of hearts we know is not the kind that ought
to be passed in order to accomplish the purpose we have in view; and, secondly, on my
conviction that the succession duties field is
a purely provincial one, which never should
have been invaded by the federal authorities.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
senators, it appears to me ridiculous that a
man should be penalized for failure to disclose assets, unless the lack of disclosure was
fraudulent. I have had a little experience
in connection with estates. What often happens -is that an executor knows nothing about
the estate he is called upon to administer,
and though he may feel absolutely sure that
ho has disclosed all the assets, there may be
some that have not been brought to his
attention. Therefore I say that if there is
to be any penalty for not disclosing assets, the
Bill should make clear that this means where
assets are fraudulently concealed.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I will call attention to two
parts af the Bill, which have already been
referred to by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haýig).
First, section 16. I do not think anyone here
will dispute my conclusion that if an executor
or an heir omits, however innocently, to disclose some certain asset, his omission will
render him immediately liable, under section
16, for not only the duty, which of course
lie would have to pay in any event, but
double the duty as well, in respect of that
particular asset. That is, he would be liable
for three times the duty imposed by this Bill.
Further, this liability would not be subject

to the discretion of the Minister or an official,
but would be an absolute one. The only way
he could escape liability would be to go to
court and prove that his omission was not
intentional. Will anyone suggest that is
British justice or fairness? In committee the
Commissioner of Income Tax did not dispute
that the liability was fixed at once, and
irremovable by any means save an a.ppeal to
the court, however innocent the man might
be.
Hon. Mr. ROBýINSON: The penalty is net
three times the duty; it is 100 per cent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps 1
am wrong about that. Yes, I see it is 100
per cent of the amount of the duty; the duty
is doubled. It is in another part that the
duty is trebled.
The second provision I want to refer to is
section 36. As I have said, the penalty in

some instances is three times the d!uty. An
appeal may be made against the assessment
of duty, and if the duty is found to be net
owing, the penalty of course falls; but if the
duty is found te he owing, there is no appeal
in respect of the penalty, and only the
maximum penalty can be imposed. However
mitigating the circumstances are, and although
the penalty may amount te a large sumperbaps half or three-quarters of the duty
payable on the whole estate, or even morethe heir or executor has no appeal at all
in relation te the amount of the penalty.
That is fixed, final and irrevocable.
I feel there is net one honourable member
of this House who thinks that legislation
such as this ought te pass. What, then, is
the situation? The committee received intimation, through the Commissioner of Income
Tax-for whom no one bas higher regard
than I have-first, that the Government
wants the Bill to go through without amendment; second, that if the measure does net
work right, the Government itself will bring
down necessary amendments in six months
or a year from now; and, third, that if there
is a case in which an unfair imposition is
called for by the Act, the Commissioner will
interpret the law differently from the way it
reads. I know every honourable member of
this House must feel his breast swell with
elation as he realizes the function we fulfil!
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend bas perhaps gone beyond the
thought and statement of the Commissioner
of Income Tax, who said that the Minister
would much prefer te have the Bill go
through as it is.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We know
w'hat that means.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the Commissioner said, there was net the least intention
of denying te the Senate the right to exercise
its discretion. He feels that this is but a
provisional measure, which will have to be
worked out. It contains many clauses that
will need correction. The penalty clauses
provide considerable ground for special and
minute study. Some members of the conmittee suggested that any amount mentioned
as a penalty should be provided"as a maximum penalty only; that the Bill should state
the penalty shall net exceed a certain amount.
It was contended this would give the Minister leeway te judge as te the degree of
guilt and te base the penalty upon that. A
duty of that kind would necessitate detailed
and careful study of many cases by the
department and the Minister. Other memhers of the committee suggested it should be
left te the Exchequer Court te fix the amount

Df the penalty. Additional suggestions were
made. The representative of the Minister
told us that all these suggestions-and, I
may say, all that are made in this Chamberwill receive careful consideration when the
bill to amend the Succession Duty Act is
being prepared for, as I think he said, next
session. He stated the Minister was inclined
to temper these penalties so they would not
rmn counter to his own sense of justice
and equity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
point out that

the correction is as plain as

the discretion of the Minister before the
liability becomes fixed and immovable." To
that simple and clear correction the Commissioner quite agreed. But word comes, "The
Government wants the Bill passed unanended,"
and we know what that means.
It is for my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honourable friend to say or think what
would be the state of mind of the Government
were the Bill rcturned to the House of Conmons with amendments. Of course, I cannot
bind the Government as to what would be its
action. However, after hearing the Commissioner of Income Tax we decided that we
would pass the Bill, relying on the assurance
which lin gave us with the authority of the
Minister.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I add,ressed a few words to
the House when this measure was before us
two days ago. Those words were spoken at
a time when I had net had an opportunity
as thoroughly to review the various factors
appertaining to the legality of the measure as
I should have liked, to have, and I may not
have presented with thorough accuracy my
objections to the Bill. I know of nothing
I then said that was not correct, but I did
net have as full a comprehension of the
situation as I feel I have to-day.
Our Foreign Insurance Companies Act of
1932 contained a provision that no foreign
insurance company could do business in
Canada unless it had a Dominion licence.
This clause, if it were valid, prevented a
company from getting a provincial licence
and operating without a federal licence. We
assuned jurisdiction and jusufied it on the

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented
the committee's report on Bill 88, an Act to
amend the Special War Revenie Act.
He said: The committee have examined the
Bill and beg leave to report the sane withonut
amendment. In submitting this report the
committee desire to include the following
statement from the honourable the Minister
of Finance with respect to clauses 3 and 4
of the Bill:
My position is this:
The Superintendent of Insurance has pointed
out the inconsistency between section 16 of the
Special War Revenue Act, wbich apparently
assumes the validity of a provincial licence
even when there is no Dominion licence in the
case of a foreign company, and section 58 of
the Foreign Insurance Companies Act. which
mnakes a Dominion licence an esseitial prerequisite to the transaction of business in
Hon. Mr. DANDUSRAND.

JUNE 5, 1941
ground that, a foreign insurance company
being an alien, the Federal Parliament could
exercise control. That the Federal Parliament
has control in respect of aliens no one
disputes; but there are those who very vigorously question whether we can utilize that
jurisdiction ta effect a purpose relating ta a
subject which comes within provincial jurisdiction, such as the business of insurance.
This is what follows. Lloyd's come in and do
the business of insurance under provincial
licence. But Lloyd's do not become liable ta
exclusion, for the reason that by the Act they
are specifically excepted and require no
Dominion licence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Act of
1934?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1932.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not 1932; 1934.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It does not
matter. I think it is the Act of 1932.
Another company comes in, the Mutual
Insurance Company of Boston-not a fire
company-and takes out a Quebec licence in
1934 and an Ontario licence in 1937, and
operates in a limited way within those two
provinces.
Under the 1932 Act the factory mutuals,
as they were then and are still known, were
permitted to come in, getting, of course, a
federal licence and making their deposits
federally, under conditions different from those
which govern deposits of the other companies.
The factory mutuals represented that they
could not make their Canadian deposits
applicable only to their Canadian insured.
They convinced the House at that time,
and no doubt it was correct, that they could
not. Lloyd's said they could not, and they
have made no deposits. On the other hand,
the factory mutuals have come in, got their
licence and made their deposits, such deposits
under this exceptional provision being applicable over the whole area of their insured,
instead of being confined solely ta their
Canadian policyholders.
The provision under which those factory
mutuals came in was a provision admitting
fire companies of this character. Just why
"fire" was inserted I do not know. Likely it
was never thought there would be any
other than factory mutuals that wete fire
companies.
In 1934, when this Boston company sought
ta come in in the same way and applied
for a licence federally, so as ta get in under
section 58, referred ta by the chairman. of
the committee, it was refused on the ground
that it was not a fire company. No fault

207

can be found with the refusal, because unfort
· unately the exception, which was restricted ta
factory mutuals, used the word "fire."
It
is clear that this Boston company was only
too willing t'o take out a federal licence,
but was not able to do so, because it was
of the nature of the factory mutuals. Being
a continental concern, it could not allocate
funds applicable only ta Canadian policyholders; it was.unable under the very nature
of its operations or under its charter. It
should have been permitted by the law ta
come in in the same way as the factory
mutuals. Therefore this company, as I have
said, simply took out a Quebec licence and
three years later an Ontario licence. It is
a strong, reputable company, adequately,
indeed amply, financed.
I have listened ta the report which the
chairman of the committee made of the words
of the Superintendent of Insurance. He said:
"We want this amending legislation ta bring
our taxation law into accord with our general
law. Our general law, embodied in this section
58, forbids any foreign company ta come into
Canada and do business without a federal
licence. I cannot enforce that law unless you
will give me a taxation provision enabling
me specially ta tax the shareholders of that
company."
Now, my first question is this: Why can
he not do so? If Parliament passes a lawsection 58-forbidding any alien company ta
do business in this Dominion without a
federal licence, why can he not enforce it?
Did he explain ta the committee what his
hindrance was?
Hon. Mr.
knowledge.

BLACK:

No,

ta

my

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Not at all.
Is it not strange ta the minds of honourable
members that the Superintendent of Insurance, with the law there forbidding admission of these companies, cannot stop them?
One would think all he had ta do was to go
ta the appropriate court and get an order.
Our laws are not just draps of water or
waves of wind. Why does he not do so?
Well, I will give you what is in my mind.
I think he has been advised by the Department of Justice that section 58 will not
stand-or I do not know anything about it.
If he has not been so advised there is certainly a way of enforcing the law. I know
of no other inference than that he is afraid
ta take action under section 58. He says:
"Give me a taxation provision, and then I
will enforce it. Allow me ta tax these people,
allow me ta impose a 10 per cent tax over
and above the 2 per cent provided by section

208

SENATE

14-12 per cent on the premium income from
every Canadian policyholder who pays into
that company, and I will shut the company
out."
For the ability of the Superintendent of
Insurance I have profound regard; for bis
will-power I have just as profound a regard;
for his persistency I place him away ahead of
all others of his race.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But are we
to do bis bidding?
He says, "Give me a
taxation weapon and I will keep these fellows
out." The Privy Council says, "You cannot
give taxation weapons for any purpose except
taxation." It has told us that time and again;
but we obediently follow the Superintendent
of Insurance. In the Reciprocal Insurers' case,
decided towards the end of 1931 and reported
in 1932, the Privy Council told us we had
passed two sections of the Criminal Code508C and 508D-which made it an indictable offence to carry on the business of insurance without a federal licence. We had
sought to use our criminal jurisdiction to
obtain an end respecting the business of insurance, and we were jerked to account by the
Privy Council, and properly se. These two
sections were passed wben I was a mener of
the Government. I do net suppose I ever
knew they were passed; I was engaged in other
occupations then; and if I had known, I
should not likely have seen the objection
anyway. Surely, in the light of this decision,
no mind is confused now. The Privy Council
said, "You cannot bring in your insurance
jurisdiction by the scruff of the neck and
thereby usurp the jurisdiction of the provinces in the matter of insurance," and it
declared these two sections to be null and
void. I think that any of us who had studied
these sections at the time and fully realized
their purport, and the circuitous by-paths by
which we were attempting to gain an end
tbat we had no right to gain under the Constitution, would have been ashamed to pass
them.
We tried again in 1923, and the legislation
was arraigned before the Privy Council, this
time at the instance of the province of Quebece;
and again wbat we had done was declared
illegal. The legislation of 1923 which I refer
to is to be found in sections 16, 20 and 21 of
the Special War Revenue Act, the very Act
we are dealing with now. The question was
whether these clauses, which imnposed a tax
of 5 per cent of the total net cost of insurance
for the preceding year on anyone who insured
bis property in any British or foreign conpany not licensed federally, were within the
legislative conipetence of this Parliament. The
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

judgment of the Privy Council is about as
clear as any judgment that ever found reflection in the English language. It says:
Their Lordships cannot do better than quote
and then paraphrase a portion of the w ords of
Duff J. in the Reciprocal Insurers' case.
Mr. Justice Duff, sitting as an Imperial Privy
Councillor on the Reciprocal Insurers' case,
had used the following language:
In accordance with the principle inherent in
these decisions their Lordships thionk it is no
longer open to dispute that the Parliament of
Canada cannot, by purporting to create penal
sanctions under section 91, head 27, appropriate
to itself exclusively a field of jurissdiction in
which, apart from such a procedure, it could
exert no legal authority, and that if, when
examined as a whole, legislation in forrn
criminal is found, in aspects and for purposes
exclusive:ly within the Provincial sphere, to
deal with matters committed to the provinces,
it cannot be upheld as valid.
As Lord Dunedin said, in expressing the
opinion of the Privy Council:
If instead of the words "create penal sanctions under section 91, head 27," you substitute
the words "exercise taxation powers under
section 91, head 3," and for the word "criinio al"
substitute

"taxing,"

precisely their

the

Lordships'

sentence

expresses

views.

So I read the opinion of the Privy Council,
paraphrased by Lord Dunedin, as representing
precisely their Lordships' judgment of the law
as it is to-day-and their judgment is final.
In accordance with the principle inherent in
these decisions their Lordships think it is no
longer open to dispute that the Parlianent of
Canada cannot, by purporting to exercise
taxation powers under section 91, heai 3Just what we are doing by the Bill before us.
-appropriate

jurisdiction in which, apart from suci a procedure, it could exert no legal authority. and
that if, when examined as a whole. legislation
in forrm

taxing is found, in

aspects and

for

purposes exclusively within the Provincial
sphere, to deal with matters connitted to
the provinces, it cannot be upheld as valid.
If Lord Dunedin had set out to describe what
we are doing here, he could not have done it
more accurately. It is just what we tried te
do in the legislation brought before the Privy
Council by Quebec, which law was declared
isuvalid and set aside.
I should like te vote against this measure.
My mind revolts against the passing of legislation of this kind. If we cannet deosmething
directly, for goodness sake let us net try to
do it at all.
I am not at all certain that section 58 of the
Foreign Insurance Companies Act is valid. I
would not ask people to have great regard
for it if I were. If section 58 is not valid, we
have no excuse for passing this; if section 58
is valid, we have no need of this.
The
Superintendent of Insurance wosuld not raise

JUNE 5, 1941

the question the Department of - Justice is
afraid of, and he asks us again to debase ourselves in this way and defy the Privy Council.
He is confronted by the Minister of Finance,
and, this time, by the objections of the
province of Ontario.
Bon. Mr. HAIG: And New Brunswick.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And of New
Brunswick too-and he says: "Oh, pass this,
pass this, and after it is passed we shall refer
the clause to the Supreme Court." Very
good. But what is to happen the company

insured? Is the company not likely to lose
its clientele? It certainly is going to be put
to great expense.. I do not suppose that can
be avoided. I should like it to be avoided by
our voting against the measure. But, I ask,
would it not be the fair thing to suspend the
section until judgment is passed upon it?
Can any harrm be done that way? If in that
way we seek only to establish our jurisdiction,
and, having established it, to act upon it,
we do no wrong; but if we do it this way we
do a wrong, unless we are upheld against
the judgments of the past.
I therefore move:
That this Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be amended by adding the following
as section 29 thereof:

Sections 3 and 4 of this Act shall not come
into effect until proclamation by the Governor
in Council, and such proclamation shall not be
issued until section 4 of this Act shall have
been submitted to the Supreme Court of
Canada for the purpose of having the judgment
of the said Court on the constitutionality of
said section 4, and said judgment has been given.
You will ask why I include section 3 in
this motion when only section 4 is to be
submitted. Section 3 is essential for the
purposes of the department only if section 4
becomes law. It is really rather peculiar that
section 3 should be there. What section 3
does is to remove Lloyd's frorn the definition
of a British company. If by section 3 Lloyd's
were not taken out, all the insurers in Lloyd's
would corne under section 4 and would have
to pay the extra ten per cent. I do not know
why they should not pay it if the insurers
in the Boston company have to do so. I am
do not
not asking that they should pay it-I
think they should-and certainly the Boston
company is not asking that they should; but
as a matter of principle there is no difference
between them. One cannot help feeling that
this was done to avoid the tremendous opposition that would arise from the vast multitude
of Lloyd's insurers in Canada. If that was
not the reason, I should be glad to hear what
it was, because in point of principle I cannot

2u

distinguish Lloyd's insurers from the insurers
in the Boston company. I never heard of any
distinction.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Why should there be
any?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
there should be any at all. I say section 3
is there to be in effect only if section 4 comes
in; so they should both be suspended until
the constitutionality of section 4 is determined
by the courts. If the decision is unfavourable,
section 3 will never come into effect; if it
is favourable, they will both come into effect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my right
honourable friend say that these clauses affect
Lloyd's?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They take
care that Lloyd's are nut affected.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
are not affected by this.

Then Lloyd's

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
They are not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
affected by this because in 1934 my right
honourable friend himself eliminated Lloyd's
frorn the operation of the ActRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -by the definition of a British company, calling it an
incorporated company. As Lloyd's were not
incorporated, they were not covered by our
Act. My right honourable friend and I are
agreed that this has nothing to do with Lloyd's.
But he overlooks the fact that the Department
of Justice was consulted and declared this to
be intra vires of our Parliament. We come
to Parliament supported by that opinion, and
I say Parliament has no right to ignore that
and take the stand that its authority is limited.
In the opinion of the Department of Justice
we are here acting within our own powers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Has the
honourable leader got that opinion of the
Department of Justice there? I should like
to have it read.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend was not present in committee
last evening when Mr. Finlayson was called
upon to discuss this matter. I asked him
about this point. And I may say that yesterday morning-I woke early in order to attend
to these questions-I asked the Minister of
Finance about the point, in the presence of
Mr. Finlayson. They both stated they had
the opinion of the Department of Justice as
to the legality of our action.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to hear the opinion read.

210

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Let me now
repeat wlat the Minister of Finance stated
with respect to sections 3 and 4:
My position is this:
The Superintendent of Insurance bas pointed
out the inconsistency between section 16 of the
Special War Revenue Act, which apparently
assumes the validity of a provincial licence even
when there is no Dominion licence in the case
of a foreign company, and section 58 of the
Foreign Insurance Companies Act, which makes
a Dominion licence an essential prerequisite
to the transaction of business in Canada by
such foreign company. The Superintendent of
Insurance says that it is essential that this
inconsistency be removed if he is to enforce
section 58 of the Foreign Insurance Companies
Act effectively.
One company is violating section 58 of the
Foreign Insurance Compasies Act, and the
Superintendent tells me that there is a prospect
of other violations taking place.
Section 58 was framed in the liglt of the
decision of the Privy Council in 1931 and is
believed by the Government to be constitutionally valid. It was hoped that no province would
challenge that position. Now that the governments of two provinces have donc so and the
Attorney-General of Ontario has requested that
there be a reference to the courts in order to
determine whether such legislation is within
the competence of the Parliament of Canada, I
am advising the Attorney-General of Ontario
that if the legislation is passed, I will recommend te the Governnent of the Dominion that
a reference be made to the Supreme Court of
Canada for the purpose of determining the
validity of the legislation.
It is my view that it w ould be better in
the interests of all for the constitutional point
to be decided so that there will be certainty
in the matter, than that the present unsatisfactory situation continue.
I may say that a more satisfactory way of
determining the validity of the proposed enactment would be by proceedings between the
Crown and any foreign company violating the
provisions of section 58, but as -a request has
been made for a reference, I am prepared to
recommend te the Government that they accede
to that request.
The Government's offer to refer the matter
to the Suprerne Court was made on the
suggestion
of the
Attorney-General
for
Ontario. That province and New Brunswick
expressly desired that the point be determined, and the Minister of Finance said he
would have it done. It was suggested in
committee yesterday that section 4 might be
suspended until judgment is handed down.
The Superintendent of Insurance said-and
I supported him in this-that a reference
could be submitted probably by the first
of September, and a decision obtained some
time beween the first of January and the
spring. He added that no taxation could
bc levied under the section before the spring.
In the circumstances I take it for granted
we should proceed on the assumption that
the Department of Justice is correct in sayng it is within our constitutional power
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

to enact this measure. I urge that we should
deal with my right honourable friend's
amendment, which I do not intend to support.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
did not know the right honourable leader on
this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) was
going to make a motion at all. At the committee last night I suggested that section 4
be suspended until a decision had been handed
down by the coui t, and that if the decision
were favourable to the Dominion the section
be tien made effective by proclamation. My
honourable friend the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) did not say
he had an opinion that the section was
valid. Neither did Mr. Finlayson give me
such information when I asked him about
the section. All he said was that he felt
sure a decision could be handed down before
he would be required to levy the taxes. He
explained he could not make a levy until
after the 31st of December, when he got
returns fron brokers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I lad a conversation with the Minister and Mr. Finlayson
together. I do not renember whether the
department's opinion was referred to before
the committee.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it was not.
I am doubtful if a reference can be made
to the Supreme Court before the end of
September. The fall sittings do not begin
until the 20th of that month. The court
usight come back earlier, but that is unlikely,
as a good many judgments have been reserved
and are still to be rendered. After the
Supreme Court's decision is handed down,
there may be an appeal to the Privy Council, which would probably mean postponement of the final decision until March of
next year. That is why I suggest that section
4 be suspended and, if found valid, brought
into effect by proclamation. I must say candidly that Mr. Finlayson did not make a very
convincing answer to my suggestion. He
seemed to be set on having the legislation
passed so that he could try to have the levy
made. If my suggestion were followed we
should avoid making a challenge to Ontario
and New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gested a reference.

Ontario sug-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: But it did, not suggest
that we should pass the legislation in the
meantime. The two provinces would have a
much friendlier feeling towards the Dominion
Government if they were told, "It is our
intention not to bring section 4 into effect
until it is declared valid by the court."

opinion in a cantroversiai matter such as
this? It seems to me that we should not
deal with this section until we have at ieast
the departmcut's written opinion as ta the
validity of section 4.
Rig.ht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: ls there any reason
wliy this Bill should, be put through ta-day?
I understand wce shall be sitting next week,
probably until near the end of the week.
The only questions at issue are these: Is
section 4 valid? And is there any real
neccssity of putting the section into cffect
until the court has decîded whethcr or nat it
is within aur -constitutional pawer? Unlcss
there is some reason why this Bill should be
passed this afternoon, wc might as well put
it aver until next week.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honaurabie senatars, I
was one of those who in committee hast night
supported the proposai of the honouxable
senator from Winnipeg South.-Centre (Hon.
Mr. Haig) t¶iat the disputcd section be made
effective by proclamation, if upheld by the
court. I asked Mr. Finlayson whether he had
any objection ta that suggestion. H1e said
he had, but he faiied to give me any convincing reasan in support of bis abjection.
He semcnd-and in saying this I have 11o
wish ta be cither unfriendly or unfair ta the
Superintendent, for whom I have a higb
regard-he seemed bent on putting this campany out of business. I do nat think that is
a quite fair attitude ta take.
I arn not cxpressing any opinion as ta the
validity of section 58 of the Foreign Insurance
Companies Act of 1932. As the right honourable leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) said, that was based on the assumptian that we had jurisdiction aver aliens and
that this indirectly enabled us ta regulate the
carrying on of a particular business, a subject
that cames under the contrai of the provinces.
That will be the point ta be decided by
the Supreme Court when the reference is made.
But the very fact that a reference will be
made ta the Supreme Court-truc, at the

ilI

request of the two governments, but with the
consent of the Minister of Financc-surely
should raise in our minds such doubt concerning the constitutionality of section 58 as to
induce us ta suspend judgment in order that
we may not unfairly hurt a company which
would be directly affected by the proposed
legisiation. For that reason I think we should
refrain from asserting our jurisdiction, and
should support the motion ta suspend the
operatian of sections 3 and 4. If it is suspended,
the decision of the Supreme Court will be
known bef are the time cornes ta levy the taxes
on these insured, and, should, the judgment
be ia favour of the Crown, the revenue will
flot suifer. If, on the other hand, we insist on
immediate effect being given ta sections 3 and
4, we are at once putting an encumbrance
on the interest of every policyholder in the
company, that is, the interest in his policy,
since he will have ta pay 10 per cent more
under the law as passed. H1e is Iikely not
ta renew his policy, and no doubt the Company, with this law in force, wiIl be iosing a
substantial part of its business. Consequently,
one thing is certain: we shall hurt the cornpany, even if the decision is against the
Crown. Sa I base my suggestion on the
graund of fair dealing as between Parliament
and this campany.
Let me mention another reasan. From the
readîng of the letter which the Minister of
Finance sent ta, aur committee, one would
conclude that the Attorney-Generai of Ontario
made oniy anc request, that the matter be
referred ta the courts. But, according ta
information 1 have gathered from newspaper
reports, the Attorney-General of Ontario went
a step further. H1e asked-and I think his
request was reasonabe-that the legisiatian
should flot be proceeded with until a decision
had been given an the reference. The Minister's repiy ta that request was that the legislation had already passed the Cammons and
was now bef are this House, and naturaily
he had nu cuntrol over it. But sureiy we
have contrai, and we can exercise that contrai,
nat unreasonabiy, flot by refusing the proposed
legisiation ia the event that we have jurisdiction, flot by preventing the Minister of
Finance from coilecting an extra revenue if
he lias a right ta do sa; we do not want ta
assume such responsibiiity; but simply by
suspending sections 3 and 4 until the decision
of the courts is handed down. That seems ta
me fair, expedient and proper treatment of
what I think is a very reasonable request.

of tax on investment income, and a surtax.
The rate on non-resident owned investment
corporations is set out in section 3. Section 4
deals with earned income. The explanatory
note says:
Heretofore earned income of over $14,000
was regarded as investment income. This recognizes all earned income as such, irrespective of
the amount.
Then there is a provision for deductions for
superannuation or pension fund. Section 7
covers donations to charitable organizations by
taxpayers other than corporations, and section 8 donations to charitable organizations by
corporations. Section 9 repeals the 50 per
cent deduction in respect of patriotic donations. Alternative exemptions from investment income are provided in section 10.
Section 11 deals with residence of dependents,
and provides exemption for non-residents.
The explanatory note says:
Dependents must be residents of Canada, the
British Commonwealth or contiguous countries.
Formerly the law was not restrictive at all.
Section 12 deals with deductions of payments under the Special War Revenue Act.
The explanatory note says:
This removes the mention of "Part II" in
this -section, because Part II of the Special
War Revenue Act contains the new betting tax.
There is no need for me to go through all
the sections of this measure. As it is a money
bill, which cannot be amended in the Senate,
I feel that I should leave it to my honourable
friends to make whatever comment they wish
on any of the items.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, all we can do with regard to
this Bill, it being very definitely a taxing
measure, is to speak on it. Indeed, we do not
do much more on any bill. I will exercise
that privilege very briefly.
First of all, I ask as to the effect cf section
29. The explanation given is that it removes
an exemption from the gift tax. Gifts not
exceeding $1,000 were always exempt. Will
they not continue to be after this Bill passes?
I understand such gifts still are. If that is
not the exemption which is removed, I do
not know what it is. I put this question to
the honourable leader of the House now, but
if he prefers d-elaying the answer until third
reading, that will, of course, be satisfactory
to me.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Clause 29?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
explanatory note merely says, "Removing an
exemption from the gift tax"; it gives no
idea of what that exemption is. Why draftsmen excel on the side of brevity in their

213

explanations of some bills and are painfully
verbose in explaining others, I do not know.
Then I call attention to section 23, only
for-the purpose of putting on record information that I have, which I think is dependable.
Though I hang my words on that section,
they really have very little to do with it.
The section refers to rentals from real estate.
The information I have is that there is very
general evasion of the income tax laws by
those whose income consists of real estate
rentqls. Our income tax laws are such that
whoever may be in receipt of dividends or
interest simply has no means of escape. The
doors have been closed for years past. I
think the Minister of Finance who closed
them most effectively was my honourable
friend to my left, now the honourable senator
It is
from Amherst (Hon. Mr. Rhodes).
quite right that the doors should be closed.
Companies make a report of all to whom
dividends are sent. No man can cash a
coupon without a certificate of ownership,
and if he makes a false return he goes to
gaol-or ought to. But as to rentals there is
no such check at all. Indeed, I do not know
how an effective. check 'could be conveniently
instituted. This means that greater care and
more pains must be taken. I cannot for a
moment think the information I have is
wrong. I am informed that in Montreal,
Toronto and our other large cities there is
very general evasion by those whose income
consists of rents, such means of revenue being
difficult to trace.
Then I come to one more feature. By an
earlier section of the Bill a change is made in
the law in respect of salary income.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What clause?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Section 4.
Previously, only remuneration that did not
exceed $14,000 a year was regarded as salary.
I never was a believer in any distinction
between salary income and investment income.
The return obtained from the investment of
what a man has saved throughout his life

is just as much earned income as the money
received by the man who early in life has a
large salary. I object to the statement that
remuneration far exceeding $14,000 is still a
salary and nothing but that. Under the definition of "salary" heretofore applied, as I understand it, the limit being fixed at $14,000 a
year, any amount received in excess of that
ceased to be called salary and was taxed as if
it were investment income. Why that limit is
removed I do not know. - I would go the
whole length and make everything taxable as
an investment. I do not see any distinction
at all between the two classes of revenue.

214

SENATE

While I am on my feet, let me say this.
I think the House will agree that there is no
more persistent champion than I of individual
initiative and enterprise and the right of a man
to get what he earns, but in my judgment
the time bas come when it is the province of
government to exorcise some control of salaries.
I mean not only government salaries, which
could be controlled botter than they are, but
also corporation salaries. I have never been a
believer in stupendous, mountainous salaries.
I do not think they can be earned. They
become possible under the corporation system
by the measure of control exercised by the
active shareholders; perhaps by the larger
shareholders, usually because they are more
active. The minority shareholders have nothing to say; they just have to take what they
get. Not only do I think that the time has
come when, in the interest of shareholders
throughout our country, there should be a
measure of governmental supervision in respect
of salaries, but I think also that under the Conpanies Act, whether provincial or federal, there
should be greater protection of shareholders
generally. I am not attacking the corporate
system; it is essential in our modern world.
Neither am I in favour of undue governmental
interference; but I do believe there is a place
for some control by the State.
As respects this Bill, I protest against special
consideration being given to the man with the
salary of $100,000 or of $200,000. if there is
any such-I do not know-as against the man
who has invested as carefully as he could his
hard-earned savings, who derives from them
an income of maybe 35,000, and who pays a
heavier tax than is paid on the $200,000 by
the other fellow. It is not right. In my
judgment, for whatever it is worth, there
should be no distinction. I know this opinion
will never be accepted, for I can remember
fifteen years ago. and more, protesting against
the distinction drawn between investment
income and salary income. Here we are going
farther than we went before. If I understand the effect of this section, and if the
explanation means what it says, we are allowing the man with the gigantic salary to call
it earned, and are taxing the income on the
retired farnier's $30,000 as investment income.
There is no distinction.
The proper level is ordinarily found in the
play of supply and demand, but in a company
those who are specially strong or specially
active can exorcise a power to help thenselves,
and this, I think, should be restrained and
restricted by governmental supervision.
Hon.

senators,

Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
this question of a distinction between

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

income and salary has often come before
Parliament; oftener in the House of Conmons, perhaps, than in the Sonate. It lias
also been discussed at length in the Press for
very many years. There is quite a body of
intellectuals and men versed in economies
wbo claim there should be a distinction made
in favour of the salaried individual.
My
right honourable friend says-and he but
repeats what he said last week-that the
income accruing from investment represents
the savings of one generation in favour of
the next. That is truc.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
of the present one.

In favour

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am not disposed to examine very closely into this
matter, because I have not given it great consideration, but I may say that in certain conpanies with which I was connected the
salaries of executives, or the men at the
controls, were quite often. to my mind, very
large. I have heard of salaries of $25,000these were relatively modest-others of $50,000,
some of $75,000 and some of $100,000. When
I contended that a man could live happily
on 825,000 a year and need not look for those
larger sums, I was met with the answer that
men who have the administration of large
corporations and who devote their whole time
and energy to the immense interests confided
to their care have no time to amass money
for their children; that all they receive is the
salary, and they should receive an amount
commensurate with the importance of the
work they are carrying on; and that if their
own company does not recognize the value of
their services, other companies will take them
into thoir employ. Thus the principal objection to reducing or limiting such salaries was
that these men, whose ability ivas admitted
by all, had no other source from which they
could hope to leave anything to their children.
More than once I have suggested that a man
with a salary of $25,000 could be as happy
as one receiving $100,000, if not happier. It
has been argued that men in receipt of these
large salaries are obliged to subscribe daily
to philanthropie, social, educational and
charitable organizations, and that the $50,000
or $75,000 received by them melts very rapidly.
These are reasons which have been advanced
in support of what is regarded by some as a
fair return for services rendered by highsalaried executives.
My right honourable friend will recognize,
of course, that there will not now be great
eagerness for higher salaries, as the more the
salary the higher the rate of taxation on
income. The man who might feel that because

JUNE 10, 1941

215

of bis obligations he needed $10,000 more
would quickly perceive that at a ccrtain point
two-thirds of this increase would have to go
back to the State. So perh*aps the bigb taxation we, find here will help to reconcile certain
mndividuals to more modest salaries.
Right lion.-Mr. MEIGHlEN: My honourable friend forgets that the tendency is
exactly the other way. A company is taxed
for nearly ail its makes, especially if its
income is better than it was before; therefore
these expenses are of very littie concern to it,
and every day the tendency is ail towards
bigher salaries.

everybody must file one. 1 wish my rîght
bonourable friend (]Rigbt lion. Mr. Meîgben)
had questioned tbe Commissioner of Income
Tax when he was before us in committee,
witb a view to fanding out wbat precautions are
taken to make sure that persons with an
income from rent do not evade their proper
tax.
I bave taken note of the two or three otber
questions asked by my right bonourable friend,
and shaîl have details for bim to-morrow wben
we take the vote on third reading.

lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will put this
case to my right bonourable friend. An
exedutive feels that in view of what is being
paid by other corporations be sbould receive
an increase of salary from $50,000 to $60, 000
or $70,000. If my right bonourable friend
would take his peneil and see what, in the
last analysis, would remain if the increase were
graànted, he wojild find the resuit interesting.
Two-thirds of it would disappear in income tax.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: 1 need bardly
add tbat I have every confidence in tbe
Commissioner of Income Tax. I rose cbiefly
in the belief that my remarks would be of
saine help to bim.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Quite true.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: My rigbt bionourable friend has spoken of rentais as a
source of revenue which can be' hidden in
somne 'way or other. That is quite possible,
but I tbink the organization at the Income
Tax Brancb is such that an owner of several
bouses, or of an apartment building, would
find it very difficult ta, cheat when making
bis return. It naturally takes saime time to
check lis gross income, his expenditures and
the deductions to wbich hie is entitled. 1
agree that possibl-y it would be casier for a
real estate owner than for another person to
try to circumvent the law and evade the
proper tax. However, I have not yet heard
of any other method of checking up on the
man wbo has an income from rent than a
close examination of bis statements.
A nman may have, say, fifty tenants. WeIl,
bie bas to give a list of tbem, to filï out a'
detailed questionnaire. I very mucb doubt
that he could escape bis just tax. People wbo
pay income tax like good little men,' as -tbey
say, often complain to me that other citizens
are flot doing their duty, but wben I ask
sucb complainants to state tbe naine of an
evader tbey are very slow to do so. There
is a suspicion that somne people succeed in
getting -tbe better of the argument witb the
income tax collector. I question tbe soundness of sucb suspicion. I know of numbers
of people wbo derive modest incomes from
rent, and alI of tbem make tbeir income
tax returns. There was a time, as bonourable
senators know, wben persans wbose income

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On the 5th
of June the Minister of Justice said:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: While we are
on the Bill I will venture to say again what
I have said more than once, though not in
late years. We have an appalling surplus of
judges in Canada. At this time, when we are
struggling to get money for vital purposes,
it is just indefensible that we should be
spending so much more than there is any need
to spend on the judiciary. I am not complaining of the salaries. Indeed, some judges
are not paid enough. But in Ontario we
undoubtedly have a surplus of county court
judges.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my right
honourable friend include high court judges in
the same remark?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In Ontario
there is a surplus of county court judges. I
am not in a position to speak with regard to
Under the British North
the high court.
America Act, Quebec has a system of its own.
All the judges there are Superior Court judges.
Whether there are too many of them, I
cannot say. But Ontario unquestionably has
a surplus of county court judges, as many of
them will tell you, if you talk to them. The
continual appointing of judges for virtually
no work at all is simply grotesque.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
provincial authority-

But it is the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -which
creates the court. But the Government of
Canada does not have to appoint a judge to
the court. There is no compulsion at all on
the Dominion Government. The giving to
[he provinces of the right to create courts at
the expense of the Dominion was a defect in
our Constitution. I do not know why the
Fathers of Confederation ever permitted such
a thing. Courts are created, and then of
course pressure comes: "Oh, there is that
vacancy. I want the job, whether there is
anything to do or nôt." It is not long since
a new judge was added to the High Court
of Saskatchewan. He was not as much needed
as the fifth wheel to a coach. Really, if one

217

JUNE 10, 1941
could gather and publish information as to
the number of judges to attend to the few
cases now coming before those high courts
in the West, it would shock the country. I
arn confident thera are too many county
court judges thare as well, but I arn absolutaly
certain there are far to-o many high court
judges. What I d'id in the short time I was
in the departrnent was to refuse to make
further appointments. There were vacancies
in Ontario and -they were not filad. But that
practice of refusing to make appointmants
succumbed very soon, and vacancies have al
been fillad, staadiiy, and they are ail filad
to-day. The merry whirl goes on, and the
taxpayer has to bear the burden. I do appeal
to the Government to take a iook over the
judiciary and see whether, by simply standing
stili whan vacancias occur, it cannot reduce
the burden. I do not want to ba personai,
I arn not making an attack on anyone, but
I do know the- number of judgas now is
uttariy absurd in the respects 1 have referred
to, and I have no doubt the sarna can be said
of other provinces.

similar suggestions in the Press of the West,
that the threa courts of appeal should ha

three men on it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is very easy
to express that wish, but more difficult to
realize it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Just do not
appoint more judges; that is ail. That will
realize the wish.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourabla
friend from. Saitcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) wiil
remamber that twanty county courts were
craated in Saskatchewan. When the first King
Administration took office in the latter part
of Decambar, 1921, 1 think nineteen judgas had
been appointed, and there was considerable
pressure brought to hear to fill the twcnticth
vacancy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Whera was
this?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In Saskatchewan.
1 know, for solicitations werc made to me

once a court is created it is very difficuit

This Bill authorizes the Canadian National
Railway Company to issue bonds or other
securities not exceeding $29,414,206 in principal
amount, to provide the ainounts necessary to
meet capital expenditures dcring the year 1941
for the retirement of naturing capital obligations, general additions and betterments, and
the purchase of new equipnent.
The Bill also provides that the railway company may issue securities fdr the purpose of
purchasing or refunding unmatured securities
of the railway company.
The Governor in Coucil is authorized to
guarantee the principal, interest and sinking
funîds of securities which the railway company
is authorized to issue under the provisions of
the Bill. There is a provision enabling the
Mliniister of Finance, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, to inake teiporary loans
to the railwa
csompany for the purpose of
Meeting authorized expenditures of the railway
conpany and for the purpose of purchasing or
refunding securities of the railway company.
These temporar loans are to be secured by
securities which the raiiway eompany is by
the Bill authorized to issue.
The Bill also authorizes the railway company
to pay supplementary contributions to the
Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island Railways Employees' Provident Fund and to the
Grand Trunk Raiiway of Canada Superannuation and Provident Fund.
Finally, as this year tiere is no specific parliamentary appropriation for deficit account.
the Minister of Finance is authorized to make
temporary loans for interim deficits wbich are
to be reimbursed from the current revenues of
the National Railway Systeni.
Honourable members will find on reference
to the various statutes concerning this matter
that this Bill is virtuallv on the same lines
as the Bills we have adopted from 1931 to
1940.
I would direct the attention of honourable
members to paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 2, which set out the various securities to
be issued for refunding and capital expenditures. They rend as follows:
(a) Retirement of maturing capital obligations, miscellaneous maturing or matured notes
and other obligations secured or unsecured and
payient of sinking funds, not exceeding
$9,378,000;
(b) Additions and betterments including coordination and acquisition of real or personal
property, not exceeding $20.036,206 estimated
as follows:Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

$13,270,206
344,000

6,414,206
$20,036,206
Then follows this proviso:
Provided, however, that for such purposes the
aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding of the securities which the National
Company is authorized by this section to issue
from time to time shall not exceed the sum of
$29,414,206, being the total of the items hereinbefore set out.
With these few remarks I move second
rcading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the explanations make one
wonder how so many words could be used
with the total result of explaining nothing at
all. All the words on the right-hand side of
the page simply repeat what is said on the
left-hand side. For example:
The Bill also authorizes the railway conipany
to pay supplementary contributions to the
Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island Railways Enployees' Provident Fund and to the
Grand Trunk Railway of Canada Superannuation and Provident Fund.
Tiat is what is said in section 11, but it
does not explain why we authorize the conpany to pay these moncys. What is the
rcason for it? The Minister bas said that in
general the Bill runs along the lines of
previous bills. There may have been a clause
similar ·o this in previous bills, together
t
with an explanation, but I cannot recall any
such clause. If a similar authorization appeared
year after year, and there was sound ground

for it, why not enact it once for all? Why
come back year after year to authorize exactly
the sarne thing?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The reason is
evident: the amounts needed from year to
year were not the sarne.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good.
But we have no information at all about
them. The Bill does not say what the amount
is. It just says if there is a deficit-and there
is-the Canadian National Railways can pay
it out of their own noney-which, of course,
is the country's. Why they should pay it, I
do not know. I apprehend that we shall have
sometlhing like this to do with the Unemployment Insurance Bill year after year, as I
stated when that Bill was under discussion.

JIJNE 10, 1941
When you establish on a certain basis an
employees' provident fund, why does the
company have to alter the basis year by
year? Apparently that is what is done. Now,
in respect of Canadian National Railways
expenditures w e ouglit to have details much
more specifie and defiiteHon. Mr. CALDER- Hear, hear.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -than in
any other measure, because no vote is required
for these. We are just authorizing this coinpany, whose directors are really the trustees
of a certain large enterprise whicli is owned
by the nation, to pay moneys under their
bands. Surely we should know exactly, and
yet there is nothing whatever to show, what
they are going to pay, and why they are going
to pay it.
Now I turn back to the main clause of
the Bill, which authorizes payment of
$29,414,26 in respect of general additions and
betterments, and new equipment. From the
figure given for additions and betterments,
namely, $15,691,257, there is a deduction of
$2,069,M57 for equipment rietirements, leaving a net of $13,622,000. From the $13,614,206
for the purchase of new equipment and the
acquisition of securities, there is a deduction
"available from Depreciation Reserve, $7,200,000," leaving a net of $6,414,206. From
these figures we get a net total of $20,036,206.
But the Bill authorizes a total of $29,414,206.
If my riglit
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend wîll look under paragraph
(a) lie will find a figure which brings this up
to $29,000,000.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Oh, 69,378.000
for the retirement of maturing capital obligations is added to the $20,036,206 which appears
on page 2. As they are maturing capital
obligations they have to be met. That is
probably sufficient, but what is given on page
2 is certainly not sufficient. Surely this Bouse
bas a right to know what are the general
additions and hetterments. I have a suspicion
as to what the main item is, and if my
suspicion is correct I arn surprised that the
Goverument seeks to conceal it.

219

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no. There
remains but $2,000,000 to finish the work.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: But the rest
has been spent.
It bas been
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
spent, but under a new and revised estimate
of thrce years ago, which said that 812,000,000
would do it. In this item there is probably
some $2,000,000 odd to finish the work.
Righ t Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: And how
nîuch lias been spent on it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 think it would
run up to soute $27,000,000. In 1931, when the
work was stopped, there had been an expenditutre of $17,000,000.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The sum of
$17,000,000 had been spent before the work
was stopped by Mr. Bennett. How mucli lias
been spent since?
I can give the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
figure to my right honourable friend.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to get figures as to how mucli lias been spent
since and how much is in this vote, and
information as to what the vote is for.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If these figures
have not been given I shall get them. I have
seen them in the Press, if not in Hansard.'
If ail the figures which my right honourable
friend desires have flot been furnished, there
is a reason. A committee of the Bouse of
Commons sits on the expenditures and estimates of the Canadian National for the current
year, and it has ail these details.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That does flot
help us any.
And the coinHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mittee's examination is very minute. I am
under the impression that in years gone by,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Shall I put them
Yes.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Mr. Cardin: In the absence of the Minister
of Finance I cen give to my honourable friend
at least a part of the information he seeks.
But before doing so I cannot help expressing
my thanks for his kind words in regard to
myself and the little I have been able to
achieve in my political life. I hope honourable
members will understand that I an not as bad
as he pictured me by overwhelming me with
all kinds of compliments in regard to my
political sagacity.
The amount of $29,414,206 which is required
by the Canadian National Railways for the
year 1941 compares with an amount of
$21,000,000 in 1940 and somewhat similar
amounts which have been provided by Parliament as far back as my recollection goes, up
to 1937.
The first item is additions and betterments.
This represents a proposed expenditure of
$15,691,257. The second is new equipment purchases, $13,270,206. The new equipment which
is required by the railway is requested mainly
on representations made by the Department
of Munitions and Supply and the war departments, which state that the trafflic that will
have to be moved during 1941 will exceed by
a very large amount the traffic moved by the
railway during 1940. As a result of examination
of the requirements for munitions and war
materials it has been represented to the railway that the amount of freiglit they will be
expected to move during 1942 will exceed by
far that which is expected for the year 1941.
Basing their estimates on these representations,
made to them by those who are supposed to
know, as to the volume of freiglht that the
railway will be called upon to move, it was
decided by the management that they should
provide additional cars and locomotives required
for the movement of that additional traffic.
Next is the acquisition of securities, amounting to $340,000. I can give the details of those
securities. They are: Atlantic and St. Lawrence
Railroad Company, Toronto Terminals Railway
Company, Northern Alberta Railways Company,
Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad Company; total $340,000.
3Ir. Hanson (York-Sunbury):
Are these
annual eccruele or are they buying these
securities in?
Mr. Cardin: No, they are annual. We provide also for maturing capital obligations,
sinking fund and equipment payments. The
amount of that item in round figures is
$9.378.000. If my bonourable friend desires. I
can give a list of the maturing capital
obligations.
I think that about covers it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That leaves
severely alone the information I ask for,
which is: What are those general additions
and betterments?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall get the
information in detail to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Minister
has kept track of my request regarding
section 11?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg pardon?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Minister
has a note of my request about section 11, as
well as section 2?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 11 and
section 2?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, yes. Section 11 refers to the contribution to the
Intercolonial and Prince Edward Railways
Employees' Provident Fund, and section 2
envers betterments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. And
how much has been spent on this terminal?
I may say I have seen no very prominent
reference to the Montreal terminal in the
advertising for the Victory Loan.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely my right
honourable friend will not again start discussion of the terminal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I shall
have more mercy on my honourable friend.
1 shall refrain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right lionourable friend may have forgotten that we
had considerable discussion on this matter
two or three years ago and it was decided then
to complete the Montreal terminal in a modified form. That policy has been pursued.
Surely, when we are on the last lap, my right
honourable friend will not desire to discuss
again the whole reason for this improvement.
It las been well said elsewhere that no other
city in Canada would have stood for the
treatment received by the metropolis of
Canada at the hands of the Canadian National
Railways in the matter of terminals and
stations. I know of no other large city in the
country which would have accepted such a
situation. Now we are about to finish the
work. I hope that, when the trains pass the
Victoria Bridge and go direct to the tunnel,
invitations will be issued and my right honourable friend will come with me to see what has
been done.
The motion was agreed to. and the Bill was
read the second time.
LABOUR DEPARTMENT BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 100. an Ant to amend the
Labour Department Act.
The Bill was read the first time.

JUINE 10, 1941
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With leave, I
would move that the Bill be read the second
time now.
Right Hýon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, this Bill provides for the appointment o~f an Associate Deputy Minister of
Labour. I should like information as to how
man*y deputy ministers, assistant deputy ministers and the like we have. The ]Jepartment
of Labour bas neyer been one of the major
departmnents. By a major department I mean
one in which the responsibilities are heavy in
respect of expenditures, administration, and
so forth. I can remember debates as to
whether the Deputy Minister of Labour should
receive the samne salary as the deputy of a
major department.
If my recoilection is
riglit, the deputy who recently retired, a very
competent man, was paid $8,000, -which is nýot
as much as the deputy of a major department
receives. He is, I presume, on superannuation, the amount of which I do not know.
Now we have a new deputy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Mr. Stewart.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Stewart.
I understand his salary is, not $8,000, but
$12,000. In addition we have an associate
deputy, whose saiary bas been stated in the
Press, no doubt correctly, to be $9,000. To
assist them there is another man, the amount
of whose saiary 1 do not, know. Instead of
the $8,000 which until iately was the cost of
the Deputy Min'ister's -office, the amount must
now be close to $25,000. There is a war on,
it is true. But there was a war before, and we
did not have to man the Department of
Labour up to the rafters on that accotint.
However, expense does not count with a
Government which seeks to measure its war
effort merely in dollars.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that before we pass -this Bill
we should have, as my riglit honourable
friend (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen) says, some
facts as to the situation in ail the departments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thînk I can
give some details.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: We sbould have
information as to the chief officers in every
department-the deputy and assistant deputies and persons of like standing. We muet
bear in mind that if an associate deputy
minister is appointed in one department, there
is likely to be a request from ail the other
departments for a similar appointment. That
is usually what happens whenever a move of

221

this kind is made. I do flot remember having
ever before heard of the appointment of an
associate depu.ty minister. There are assistant
deputy ministers, as we know, but the present
proposai is a new kind of thing.
Do not misunderstand me. I arn pretty well
aware what the conditions are in relation to
administrative work in every department

which is anywhere close ýto the war situation.
1 do flot suggest there should be one second's
hesitation in getting ail the help necessary in
order to do whatever work, has to be donc.
My objection bas always bcen that in a
situation sucli as this ministers have faiied to
engage the assistants they needed, and instead
have tried to carry burdens almost humanly
impoýssible to, bear. I am not saying that a
man is flot required to do this work in the
Department of Labour. What I fear is that
by passing legisiation of tbis kind we shall
simply be laying doýwn a precedent that wilI
be foilowed by every other departmnent in the
Service. I urge that before we deal with this
measure we should have a comprehensive
statement as to the chief officers in every
department.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, here-is the statement which the
Minister of Labour made in the other House:
The work of the Department of Labour bas
been very greatly increased iu the' last two
years. In the first place the purpose of this
Bill because the present Associate Deputy
Minister bas been appointed-is to make bis
appointment permanent rather than temporary.
The work of the department bas been greatly
expanded in three directions: in the first place,
in the wide extension of the Industrial Disputes
Investigation Act; in the second place, in the
passing of the Unemployment Insurance Act; in
the third place, through the war emergency
training plan.
The Department of Labour bas, I believe,
always had a minimum of he]p for the wide
work it bas to do. We have appited as
Associate Deputy Minister Mr. MacNýiamara,
former Deputy Minister of Labour and Publie
Works in the province of Manitoba. He bas
been aeting since the regrettable death of
Doctor Sirois as .Acting Cbief Commissioner of
the Unemployment Insurance Act. The salary
which. the Leader of the Opposition refers to
as being large is not really large when you
consider the administrative ability which tlîe
presentincumbent as Associate Deputy Minister
of Labour bas brou glt to bear in the organization of the Unemployment Insurance Act. It

is because of this wide extension of the definite

fonctions of the Department of Labour that the

appointment of an -associate deputy minister is
necessary and desirable.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is
the saiary?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think
Minister gives that later. He goes on:

the

say that Mr. MacNamara is
task in an excellent way and
work in promoting the early
the Unem,ployment Insurance

be refused any help they need. The men
who are carrying the load realize the necessity of competent assistants.

Hon. Mr. Hanson asked that very question:
"What is the salary?" The Minister replied:
$9,000. I do not believe it is excessive. In
my opinion it is justified by the added responsibilities placed upon the Department of Labour;
and may I suggest that there will be even
greater responsibilities after the war is over.
ln view of all these considerations I believe
it will be agreed that the appointment of an
associate deputy minister is desirable.

No one would dispute that the appointment
of Mr. Stewart as Deputy Minister was an
excellent one; and, as the Leader of the
Opposition in the other House (Hon. Mr.
Hanson) admits, Mr. MacNamara is an able
administrator: so, in matters upon which be
requires advice, as well as in the general
administration of the department, the Minister bas two very capable men upon whom
to rely.

I need hardly
carrying on his
doing splendid
introduction of
Act.

Hon. Mr. Hanson then made ·this comment:
I agree with what the Minister bas said
respecting the administrative ability of Mr.
MacNamara. He is a man who had wide experience in another field when lie came here to lead
the Dependents' Allowance Board. I am satisfied he did excellent work when he was promoted, if that is the proper expression, to the
office of acting head of the Unemployment
Insurance Commission. I had hoped the Minister and the Government would see their way
clear to appoint him permanently to that
position in place of Mr. Sirois. Apparently,
however, that is not now the proposal, and the
position is to be filled otherwise.
One must not be satisfied with a state of
things that existed twenty or twenty-five
years ago. The Department of Labour is now
doing very important war work. To realize
wlat the Government bas to contend with,
one need only think of the labour difficulties,
the rumblings of which we all have heard.
My honourable friend knows what the situation is in the United States and in this
country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But as soon
as a difficulty arises the Department of Labour
washes its hands of the problem and turns it
over to the Department of Justice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Our situation is
totally different from what it was twenty-five
Canada's present industrial
years ago.
activities are tremendous. The transformation of Canadian industries from a peace-time
to a war-time basis has been called a miracle.
But frictions and difficulties -of a serious
nature do arise here and there. In addition
to the work of administering the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Department of
Labour will have in the future increasingly
important functions to perform. It is difficult
for us, net in a position to know all that the
department is doing, to say that it is overstaffed. The Minister, who does know what
is going on, bas taken the responsibility of
recommending this appointment. My honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
bas wisely said that departments should net
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

Is the Senate in a position to say that the
Department of Labour is overmanned? I think
it would he wiser for us to take for granted
that the men at the helm in that department
know what their needs are.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Honourable members, may I add another word? I do not
object to the securing of any help that is
necessary. My point is tîat this Bill would
create a permanent office for-shall I say?-a
temporary condition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does my honourable friend visualize what the temporary
condition is? And can he say bow long it
wxill last?
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The aftermath
of the war lias to he taken into consideration.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I eau visualize that.
Let me put my point in another way. No
request for the appointment of an associate
deputy minister lias cone from the Department of Finance. Yet, if there is one departmeut whose work lias been multiplied many
times, it must he Finance, and I dare say it
has engaged all the help it needs to carry on
the work. There is a great difference between
doing that and creating an important permanent position. As I have said, once we
establish the precedent of appointing an
associate deputy minister, there is likely to
be a request from all other departments for
a similar ofiicer. Talk abouit building up a
bureaucracy!
That is how bureaucracies are
built up,
-by
making appointients such as
this. I am saying nothing about the mai
himself, nor do I contend that his services are
not required. That is not my point at all.
I say to the Government, "Get all the help
you need at the present time, but safeguard
the public service, and do not creale permanent
offices tiat will net be neede
when the
present situation 's ended."

JUNE 10, 1941
The Minister
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
has stated that the work ahead is considerable
and that when the war ends it will ,perhaps
increase. Surely with the return of peace the
Department of Labour will have to face
important problems in the re-establishment
in civil life of hundreds of thousands of our
soldiers. Our financial structure is such as
to lead us to hope that this will involve
no considerable economic disturbance, but I
think we shall need all the best men we
have at our disposal to-day to carry on during the post-war years. With two good
men like Mr. Stewart and Mr. MacNamara
to assist the Minister, whoever he may be,
I think we may rest assured that the department will be well administered.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Probably so; but
my objection is to the title "Associate Deputy
Minister." Let' me give an illustration. We
have a Deputy Minister of National Revenue.
I am not fully acquainted with all the details,
but I know, for example, there is one commissioner under the Deputy Minister. He is
CommissionerHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Elliott.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Commissioner Elliott
looks after income -tax entirely. Then you have
Commissioner Sims, who looks afterHon. NORMAN P. LAM-BERT: As my
honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) must be aware, there is no Deputy
Minister in the Department of National
Revenue. In the Department of Finance there
are several assistants of the Deputy Minister. It is well known that during the last
five years, under the pressure of greater effort
in the department, it has been necessary to
give Dr. Clark additional expert help. There
is a commissioner in charge of -the sales tax
administration. There is also an economic
adviser acting as special assistant to the
Deputy Minister of Finance. Dr. Mackintosh,
as is well known, is filling that role at the
present time.
While on my feet I may say that yesterday I had the privilege of listening to Dr.
Bryce Stewart, Deputy Minister of Labour,
while he addressed the annual meeting of the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association. He
dealt- with problems affecting our war industry.
At the conclusion of his address he invited
questions, and answered in a very satisfactory
manner those put to him. I think it is no
exaggeration to say that the impression he
left on the meeting was more than favourable.
HeHon. Mr. CALDER: If my honourable
friend will allow me--. do not mind an interruption, but I do object to a speech. I am

223

not saying that any man now employed by
the Department of Labour has not first-class
qualifications. As I have intimated, so far as
the actual staffing of the department is
concerned, I do not know. I am objecting
rather to the proposed appointment of an
associate deputy minister. I am not opposing the appointment of any person to help
in an ordinary position in any department,
nor am I questioning his qualifications in the
slightest degree. I am merely pointing out
that if we adopt this proposed legislation we
may be opening the door to many future
appointments of the same class. As I have
already said, for goodness sake let the Government get all the first-class help it can.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: That is what it is
doing.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Certainly it is; but
do not give them titles for purposes that are
not at all necessary.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: I do not see that
the name makes any difference.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable gentleman has not been as close to the public
service as I was for some years.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: That may be an
argument, but it is not to the point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) suggested that Mr. Stewart's salary is' $12,000.
I find it is $10,000.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
to conclude my remarks, I may add, with all
deference to the objections raised to positions
in the Department of Labour, that I do not
think we should pay too much attention to
the titles applied to those positions. Undoubtedly the personnel of the department has
not been at all adequate to cope with the
growing demands of the labour problems of
this country. At the present time our problems in connection with the relations of labour
to war industry require for their solution men
of understanding, with a capacity for conciliation. This country is very fortunate to
have a man with the exceptional experience
and ability of Dr. Bryce Stewart. As is well
known, he returned to Canada to take this
position at a considerable monetary sacrifice,
in order to be of some service to his native
country in time of war.
As far as Mr. MacNamara's functions are
concerned, they are directly connected with
the wider field of social service which is
opened up by the Department of Labour in
relation to unemployment insurance, and I do
not think there is a better qualified man in
the Dominion to take charge of the executive

Special War Revenue Act.

225

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senaitors, I should like to place on Hansard
a statement for the purpose of answering some
of the remarks of my right honourable friend
and correcting sone errors in dates in the
history of the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act. It is unfortunate that my
right honourable friend was not with us in
committee, because all these facts would then
have been gone into while we were discussing
the Bill. I shall read this statement, and if
my right honourable friend desires that the
debate be adjourned until to-morrow so that
he may examine it, I shall be glad to agree.
This is a memorandum furnished to Hon.
Mr. Ilsley by the Superintendent of Insurance.
The discussion in the Senate on the motion
for third reading of this Bill is somewhat
confusing by reason of the wrong citations of
certain statutes and of certain decisions involving the Dominion's insurance legislation.
The Reciprocal Insurance case was decided
in 1924, not 1931; the Insurance Case arising
out of the reference by the province of Quebec
was decided in 1931, not 1923; the tax on
premiums paid to unlicensed insurers was first
enacted in 1922, not in 1923; the amendment
to the Act exempting Lloyd's from the obligation to obtain a licence as a prerequisite to
transacting business in Canada was passed in
1934, not 1932.
I had myself indicated that it was in 1934.
The taxation of premiums paid to unlicensed
companies was discussed at great length during
the revision of the Insurance Act in 1910. A
tax, however, was not at that time imposed.
During the war licensed companies became
subject to war taxes in the form of the Special
War Revenue Tax and the Business Profits
Tax, neither of which applied to unlicensed
insurers.
In 1922 when it became apparent that these
war taxes would, in some form or other, continue for many years, or perhaps indefinitely,
a tax on premiums paid to unlicensed insurers
was firet imposed. The purpose of this tax was
stated by the Minister of Finance on the
Budget resolution as follows:
"The whole purpose of the provision is simply
to tax the individual who is getting, as lie
believes, and, as I think, very cheap insurance.
If I buy cotton in the United States the law
penalizes me by imposing a tax of 35 per cent.
In this matter we are exceedingly moderate.
If a man wants to pass over our Canadian
companies and insure in the United States, we
do not tax him 35 per cent, but simply 5 per
cent. He is getting cheap insurance and is
being asked to contribute in a very small
degree to the business of Canada." (House of
Commons Debates, 1922, p. 3253.)
On the revision of the Act in 1932 the rate
of 5 per cent was increased to 10 per cent, at
which rate it stands to-day.
Under the amendment of 1932 the words "or
in any province thereof" were, for the first
time, inserted and as a result of those words
persons insuring with Lloyd's all over Canada
were, when Lloyd's obtained a licence from one
province, relieved of the unlicensed insurance
tax paid to Lloyd's in all other provinces as
well as in the province granting the licence.

226

SENATE

Under the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act of 1932 Lloyd's was recognized
by definition as a British company so that, as
above stated, persons insuring with Lloyd's
would, but for the words quoted above, have
been subject to the tax imposed upon persons
insuring with British companies generally.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps the
honourable gentleman would simply place this
on Hansard. I will study it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Surely. I shall
place it on Hansard.
In 1934, on a revision of the Act, the
definition of "British rompany" was changed by
deleting therefrom Lloyd's, but no change was
made in the corresponding definition of "British
company" in the Special War Revenue Act.
The result was that from 1934 on Lloyd's was
not a British company under the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act, but was
a British company under the Special War
Revenue Act. The result of the change in the
definition in the first mentioned Act was to
relieve Lloyd's of the obligation to obtain a
licence and to withdraw from the Minister the
power to grant such a licence, even if applied
for.
Section 4 of the Foreign Insurance Companies
Act, 1932, as amended, is as follows:
"No conpany shall transact the business of
inîsurance in Canada (save as lereinafter
expressly provided) unless it is registered
and lolds a certificate of registry fron the
Minister."
And section 58 imposes a penalty not exceeding
five thousand dollars and imprisonmncit for a
terne not exceeding six montis for offences

linked up with an object which is illegal must

fall.
With that decision before it Parlianeent
passed the Acts of 1932 and 1934 above referred
to and, presumably, considered them properly
framed and valid. A question was raised in
the Senate on Thursday last as to whether the
Department of Justice bas approved of the
proposed amendment. This question xvas not
raised in the Banking and Commerce Committee
on the preceding day, when I should have been
glad to have filed the opinion of that department if it liad been requested or even mentioned.
h'lieopinion is as follows:

"Ottawa, June 4, 1941.
Dear -Mr. Ilsley,Referring to your telephtone conversation
with me, t beg to aIvise you that in the
opinion of this Department the Foreign Insurance Conpanies Act, 1932, is valid legislation
of the Parliament of Canada, and that it is
within the competence of Parliament to amend
subsection 1 of section 16 of the Special War

against that provision.

So far as is known, up to 1934 no foreign
company violated these provisions. Since 1934
one conpany at least has obtained licences in
two provinces nwithout applying for registry
from the Dominion, and by so doing ias relieved
its Canadian policyiolders from the tax otherwise payable under section

by Lloyd's, while closing the door to a similar
exemption to the insured of other companies,
accorded no such concession or status, which
may be disposed to violate those other statutes.
In the decision of the Privy Council on the
Insurance Reference in 1931 it is stated:
"Their Lordships have no doubt that the
Dominion Parliament might pass an Act forbidding aliens to enter Canada or forbidding
them so to enter to engage in any business
without a licence, and further they might
furnish rules for their conduct while in
Canada, requiring them, e.g., to report at
stated intervals,"
and legislation having such a prohibition as its
object should not on 'that ground be open to
attack. The decision later states that a tax

16 of the Special

War Revenue Act.
It was stated in the discussion in the Senate
on Thursday last that the company "simply took

out a Quebec licence, and three years later an
Ontario licence," but that simple act was a
direct violation of the Foreign Insurance Conpanies Act. Attemopts have been made to have
the conpany comeeply with the Art, but it now

appears that it loes not intend to submit to
Dominion authority while continuing to operate
in the provinces mentioned.

The amendment proposed to the Special War
Revenue Act wiill remnove the apparent conflict
between the provisions as above outlined of that
Act and of the Foreign Insurance Companies
Act. The latter Act makes Dominion registry
essential to the transaction of business in
Canada; the former implies that a provincial
licence alone is sufficient.

The amendment also brings the definition of
"British Company" into accord with that in the
Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act,
and thereby recognizes the special concession
and status granted to Lloyd's by the amendment
to the latter Act in 1934. The result is to
continue the exemption to persons insuring with
Lloyd's to which they have been heretofore
entitled without any violation of other statutes

At pages 589 et seg of the Debates of the
Senate for June 27, 1934, in dealing with the
Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Bill, Report of Committee, Hon. lMr. Daiiuraid
said:

"We are legislating to control British coumI

think the other House, as well as a numbe r of
mtenbers of this Chamber, will be surprised to
find that Lloyd's, being now freed fromn obligations to which other British companies are
subject, are not only removed fronc federal
control, but inferenutially are allowed to Io
business througiout Canada under provincial
authority. Furthernmore, they are now deprived
of the opportunity of coming to the federal
authorities

for a licence.

"It lias been said, and will be repeated, that
Lloyd's have already obtained licences from one
or two of the provinces and can obtain them
from other provinces, and the Privy Counril
has declared that the provincial authorities have
the right to grant licences to insurance conpanies. Yet under our jurisdiction in bank-

JUNE 10, 1941
ruptcy and insolvency we laim to exercise control over British companies doing business in
Canada. If we have such control it should be
applied ta all companies, and it was for this
reason that I moved in committee for the
restoration of control by the federal authorities
over all British companies, including Lloyd's.
"I would point out ta the Government and the
public that although the amendments are
intended by the House of Commons ta place
all British insurance companies on an equal
footing by withdrawing from Lloyd's the privilege conferred on them by the Bill as it left
this Chamber, Lloyd's are now given permission
ta roam at large throughout the Dominion, doing
business without any federal control whatever.
It is against the granting of a privilege ta
one organization that I register my protest."
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen said:
"Let us analyse the effect of the amendment.
It means that Lloyd's but not the London &
Lancashire or some other company in England
can do business in Canada under a rovincia
licence in so far as that licence will operate.
In Quebec they operate within the terms of a
Quebec licence, in Ontario under an Ontario
licence.
They cannot operate anywhere in
Canada exceipt under a provincial licence. It
is true that others are denied the right ta
operate in this way, but again I press the
distinction that Lloyd's cannot be put through
the same mould as others, for the reason that
Lloyd's policies have behind them a security
which redounds ta the advantage and stands for
the protection of policyholders in Canada and'
all over the world. This is a security such as
the other companies cannot claim. Consequently
it is not at all-indefensible to make a distinction
in regard ta a, group of insurers who already
provide the very safeguards which, se far as
Canadian policyholders are concerned, are the
main :purpose of the Bill."
I have a note from Mr. Ilsley drawing my
attention ta a statement made last Thursday
by my right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen), that Mr. Finlayson is "confronted by the Minister of Finance." Mr.
Ilsley says:
If this meant thait I am in conflict with
Mr. Finlayson over this matter, I must state
that =it is not so, in any sense.
My right honourable friend has suggested
that pending the reference to the Supreme
Court of section 4, and the handing down of
judgment thereon, that section and section 3
should be suspended. -On Thursday last my
right honourable friend moved:
That this Bil be net now read a third time,
but that it be amended by adding the following
as section 29 thereof:
Sectione 3 and 4 of this Act shall net come
into effect until proclamation by the Governor
in Council, and such proclamation shall net be
issued until section 4 of this Act shal. have
been submitted ta the Supreme Court of Canada
for te purpose of having the judgment of the
said Court on the constitutionality of said
section 4, and said judgment has been given.
His aýonour the Speaker did not put this
motion, but I take it for granted that my
right honourable friend still intends to press it.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is quite
unreasonable, as I understood the Minister
himself (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said at the
beginning, ta expect me to absorb immediately
that long memorandum which bas just been
read, and to reach a conclusion to-night as
to its bearing on the amendment I moved. I
should like to study the document, and I
suggest that the motion for third reading stand
over until Thursday. In the meantime I should
like also to get into touch with counsel for the
company 'oncerned. This is a purely business
matter which, so far as I know, affects only
one company.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I want to be
entirely fair to my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be
that by Thursday I shall have been persuaded by this memorandum. But as it was
being read I could not belp noting that while
its author had the opinion of the Department
of Justice and was thoroughly confident of
the law, he failed to answer the one big
query that I asked last week, namely: Why
is the law net enforced? If you are so sure
of your ground, why do you stand helpless and
permit the law to be broken? The memorandum contained no answer ta that question.
However, I know that any memorandum
having the authorship which is behind this
one is always worthy of thorough study. I
understood this was signed by the Minister of
Finance, but I do not for one moment doubt
that the hand was the hand of Esau.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What I read
was a memorandum from Mr. Finlayson ta
the Minister of Finance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I thought
the Minister's signature was on it.
I never intimated that there was a conflict
between Mr. Finlayson and Mr. Ilsley.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend's statement would perhaps lead
to that interpretation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I never
intended that. If there is a conflict, I have
no doubt as to who will win.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend has met Mr. Finlayson before.
He apparently worsted him in 1934, when
Mr. Finlayson was insisting that Lloyd's
should come under the general law, and the
right honourable gentleman said, "No, they
shall not."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

I was right.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: For instance, we

crop above eight bushels to the acre. In this
event that township can be split up and the

crop failure section added to that part of
another township in which there is also a crop
failure, and the farmers in that crop failure
area can get assistance. On the other hand,
if a quarter of the township bas a good crop,
that portion can be withdrawn from the crop
failure area. * The present Act allows areas
to be traded, or transposed, so to speak.' This
Bill will enable one-half of a township where
there is a crop failure to be taken out without
anything being put back to take its place.
In short, it does not provide for substitution.
Maybe my powers of explanation are not
very good, but I think that if I had a
blackboard and a piece of chalk I could
demonstrate what is said to be the purpose
of this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I remember, in the original Act the township was
the unit.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If a certain
proportion of that unit was a failure it was
eligible for the benefits under the Act. That
is plain. If not up to that proportion of
failure, the township was expected to look
after itself. Now, if you are allowed to
juggle, to take a piece of good crop out of
one township and put it into a township that
can stand a good crop and still have sufficient
bad area to entitle it to the bonus; or if a
piece of the bad area of one township can be
combined with a similar area in another
township so that it may get the benefit-if
such is the purpose, I am sure anyone can
follow it. But in effect this enables the
Minister to distribute money wherever he
likes.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No; it must be a
quarter of a township, and it must be contiguous to the crop failure area. For instance,
if this township is a crop failure area, and
in the adjoining township there is a quarter,
or nine sections, with less than eight bushels
to the acre, those nine sections can be added
to the crop failure area in this township.
But the areas added together must be next
to each other. In other words, you cannot
pick out a few sections here and there in
any part of a township. An area to be
included must be next to a boundary line,
so that together with the eligible area in
the adjoining township it will make a unit.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then the
proper way to accomplish what is desired
would have been to say that a certain measure
of assistance can be given to any area the
boundaries of which enclose a certain acreage
on which the crop is less than so many bushels

229

to the acre. Let us take two townships, in
neither of which is there a failure area sufficiently widespread to justify assistance.
Suppose the failure area should be one-third
of a township, but in one case it is only onequarter and in the next township only onesixth. If you unite the two failure areas,
so that together they make more than onethird of the area of a township, you are just
juggling. You just put the Minister in a
position where he can juggle as he pleases.
. Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No. There must
be an area large enough to make a crop failure area, and the only thing you can add to
that is one-fourth of any township, but the
added acreage must be lying contiguous to
the crop failure area and must also have had
a crop failure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If a township
has only a small area of failure, only enough
to make up the lack in the adjoining township, why can it not look after itself?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: How many townships are there in a crop failure area?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: It must be in a
crop failure area, and unless it is one-quarter
of a township it cannot be added. You cannot pick out sections here and there and put
them in; but if there is a crop failure area
surveyed off, so to speak, and a township
bas nine, ten or twelve sections of land alongside that crop failure area, they can be
taken in.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Must the addition be
regular in shape?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No. It might
dodge out for a piece. But it must be connected with the failure area; it must lie alongside it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I cannot follow the
honourable gentleman there. He states that
one-quarter of thirty-six sections, that is, nine
sections, can be added to it.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Now, if -you get a
block of three by three, all of whichHon. Mr. MARSHALL: You would not
very often get that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But suppose you did.
Only three of the sections in that block would
be contiguous to the other area. The rest
of the sections would be back from it.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: But they would be
contiguous to the three with the bad crop.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is nothing in
the proposed law to provide that the area to
be added to a crop failure district shall be
regular in shape.

kind into the crop failure area?

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why not?

What is

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Because this added
piece must stretch down alongside it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Pardon me, but d-o
you not think we should read the explanatory
note? It says:
. . . the Minister may, at the request of the
rural municipality or, in the case of any other
area, of the government of the province, and
with the approval of the Board, substitute a
part of an ineligible township for a part of
an eligible township and eliminate from the
eligible township a part thereof equal to or
exceeding in cultivated acreage the part substi-

tuted as aforesaid and, for the purposes of
this Act, such substituted part shall be deemed
to be part of an eligible township and such
eliminated part shall be deemed to be part of
an ineligible township; Provided that no part
of a township shall be so substituted unless
such part is contiguous to an eligible township
or to an eligible part of a township. . . .
Hon. Mr. CALDER:. That does not help
us at all, so far as I can see. What must
be contiguous? Every one of the nine sections
added?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: It was found difficult to work under the present section, which
is quoted in the explanatory note opposite
page 2 and which says:
$nt.

Mr. CALDER.

. . . the Minister may, at the request of the
rural municipality or, in the case of any other
area, of the government of the province, and
with the approval of the Board, substitute a
part of an ineligible township for a part of an
eligible township and eliminate from the
eligible township a part thereof equal to or
exceeding in cultivated acreage the part substituted as aforesaid.
That is the present law. That authorized the
trading of a piece in an ineligible township
for a piece that was eligible in a crop failure
district. But that is to be done away with,
and now there is provision for the addition
of not less than one-quarter of a township, a
side of which lies alongside the other area.
No smaller piece than one-quarter of a township, or nine sections, may be taken in. On
the other hand, if in some other district there
is a piece that bas a good crop, that can be
taken out.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the honourable
gentleman pardon me? I can understand the
difficulties and I dare say it would be very
hard to define this in a law. Here is a township that is without question a short-crop area.
A township is six miles wide.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Six miles square.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: You are going to add
something to those six miles. Now you want
to add at least one-quarter of a township,
which is nine sections. You can get six sections that are contiguous to the township that

alongside this boundary and the others of

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I was talking about
the addition, in the first place, of six sections,
all of which are adjacent to the other
township.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: You cannot add
six; you must add at least nine.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am prepared to add
another three, and I have those three where
there is a crop failure. They are right up
against the six. But I cannot get a rectangle
out of that.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to have them. I may know one of them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
this Bill came before Council. There were
present fifteen men, who wanted to know the
value of the amendment and how it would
work. We were given so clear a picture of
the situation in the West and of the need
for this measure that there was unanimous
support for it. I believe that after this
section was explained in the other House
there was no opposition whatever to it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
suppose anybody understood it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my right
honourable friend has no confidence that this
legislation will work well, I suggest that the
Bill be sent to committee, where the Minister,
Hon. Mr. Gardiner, could explain it. I think
he would convince my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have never
heard the names of the members of this
board. I should like to know who they are,
to see whether I know any of them.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I may say to
the right honourable gentleman that I have
seen how this Act works. Here is a township
that has a crop failure and is eligible for
a bonus under the Act. In an adjacent half
township or quarter township the people have
no crop at all, because there was no rainfall,
and they are not entitled to anything. To
my personal knowledge a great deal of hardship has been worked by this difference in
treatment. The scheme is operated in this
way. There is a field man in, say, the
province of Manitoba. The municipalities
make application to have certain areas investigated for the purpose of seeing whether or
not they should come under the scheme. Then
the municipal councils appoint men, most of
whom are practical farmers, to go from home
to home and ascertain what the facts are.
I would say to my right honourable friend
that after having seen how the Act works
I think this amendment is very necessary. It
is easy to visualize the hardship that has

names for my right honourable friend.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: You just cannot
do it, that is all. The idea is that you cannot
add a piece that zigzags in various directions.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In other words, three
fellows can be selected and put in; three back
of them can also be put in, and three more
besides. But the fellows on the other side of
the boundary, who are in just as bad a position as those nine, cannot be pu't in.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: You cannot make
a law that will exactly suit everybody.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: This simply creates a
situation wherein the Minister can juggle the
thing as-he likes.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: A crop failure does
not stop at the highway. There may be a
road betweeu two townships, and if it does
not rain on one side of the road it may not
rain on the other side either. If there are
nine sections in a township and they are in a
rectangular form and lying alongside the
boundary of an eligible township, they can be
added.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The Lord help the
fellow who is outside the rectangle.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The Lord will
have to help many of them out there.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The right to
bounty depends on the geometrie nicety of
the rainfall. Anyway, you cannot get nine
sections in rectangular form.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No, not nine. The
amendment requires that the block be not leæ
than nine sections. That would not prevent
you from transferring twelve, if there were
twelve with a crop failure.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You might have a
rectangle, but not a square.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the rain
falls as it usually does, some fellows will
be out of luck.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Some of the fellows
will be out of luck, there is no doubt about
that. We cannot bring them all in.

232

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is true
that sections can be added, but it became
clear from questions asked by the honourable
senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
that a man's luck in getting his land added
depends altogether on the shape of the rainfall. It appears that a man may be out of
luck if the area on which rain falls is not
rectangular. That does not seem in accord
with the need mentioned by the honourable
senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. A. L.
Beaubien).
What still confuses me is this substituting
business. It is provided for in the present
Act-for this is not something new-and it
is now to be discontinued. Provision was
made for substituting for a good part in one
township a bad part in another township. For
the life of me I cannot understand that, and
I do not think anyone can explain it. I doubt
if it was understood in the other House.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:
substituting is repealed.

That provision for

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Now you can
add without substituting?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Yes. And you can
subtract without substituting.
Right Hou. Mr. MEIIGHEN: The best
thing that can be said for our position is
that we are repealing something no one
understands.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I just make
this observation? Suppose one-quarter of a
township becomes eligible for the acreage
bonus, and there is a reasonable crop in the
other three-quarters. When the nine sections
are taken out, the rest of the township, where
the crop is above so many bushels to the
acre, would not be eligible for the bonus, as
I understand it.

Hon.

Mr.

MEICHEN:

That

is

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I understood that
if the average yield in the township was
below twelve bushels to the acre, everyone
in the township was eligible for the bonus,
because the township itself was eligible. I
think I am correct.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. EULER: That is right.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: By this proposed
amendment, if a certain number of sectionsnine, twelve, or fifteen-were taken out of the
township and put into another township, the
remaining sections would not receive any
bonus. I would ask the sponsor of the Bill
(Hon. Mr. Marshall) whether I am right in
my contention.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The honourable
senator is not quite right. The clause which
this Bill would repeal because it has not been
found workable did not enable everybody in
the township to get a bonus if the average
crop was more than twelve bushels to the
acre; but it permitted taking so many sections
out of that township and substituting sections
from a township alongside it where there was
a crop failure.
However, the substitution
business did not work satisfactorily. I think
the proposed plan, repealing, as it does, that
clause, can be operated with less difficulty and
will work much less hardship. As to the
suggestion that it would encourage manipulation, I think it would provide far less
opportunity for such a practice.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The reason
we are confused is that the original conception
of townships was confusing. Townships should
not have come into the picture at all; area
alone should be the basis.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I must confess I did not have the slightest
conception of what had taken place under
the Act. It seems to me that, as the right
honourable gentleman on my left (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) says, to base this law on
geometrical lines is simply crazy. Dry areas
do not follow geometrical lines. My experience of Western Canada is that you would
find in an area of, say, 100 miles by 50 miles,
a pocket where there had not been a drop of
rain throughout the year, while all around it
were fine crops; not along geometrical lines,
but in lines that took the form of great waves.
It seems to me that to lay down geometrical
lines in dealing with an economie situation of
this kind is entirely wrong. I agree with the
principle of the law that if a farmer has
suffered a complete or nearly complete crop
failure he is entitled to assistance from the
State. Because of the conditions and restrictions contained in this Bill he cannot possibly
get such assistance, and yet he is entitled to it.
I dare say tha.t at this stage of the session it is
too late to amend this measure. However, it
does seem to me that if there is occasion
to provide for relief in cases of necessity

JUNE 11, 1941
resulting from orop failure, every man within
the province aifected should be entitled to that
assistance regardless of any geometrical hunes.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I may say to the
honourable senator that, if you. took the
individual farm as a unit, administration of
the .Act would be well nigh impossible. The
reason why the township was taken as a unit
I may give from my own experience of nearly
sixty years in the West. My farma is on the
east side of the Red river. Some years we
get plenty of ramn. On the west side, especially
beyond the Red river, as you get into the
township lines, you will find there has been
littie or no rain at ahl. Consequently, if you
allowed every farmer who bas suifered a crop
failure to corne under an acreage bonus, it
would take an army of ýofficiais to administer
the Act; it would be virtually impossible.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The only way in
which my honourable friend's proposai could
be put into effect, would be to insure against
crop failure, and then you would have to
deal with the farms.
This A.ct is no.t applicable to Saskatchewan
in cases of small crop failures; it is not applicable there unless 171 townships are involved.
As several honourable members from the West
are aware, we speak in that country in termis
of townships and ranges. In the early days,.
if you asked for directions you would be
expected to state the numiber of the lot, the
range and the tow*nship. If, for instance,
you wcre looking fer my place, you would be
told to go toý township 32, to drive out the
township line until you reached such and such
a range, and then go north two miles andl you
would be in my barnyard. In Alberta the
minimum for a crop failure area, is 90 townships, and in Manitoba 54 townships.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Scattered anywhere;
not necessarily in a block.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Not necessarily in
a block. The dlaims originate with the muniA
cipalities. They report crop failures.
municipality in any of the three Prairie
Provinces is composed of a certain nuniber
of towniships, depending on the way it is
organized. While somebody will lose out, I
do not think a'ny plan is workable unless it
runs along township and range lines. I think
the plan contained in the proposed amendment is a decided improvement on the present
plan.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Lionourable senators,
I quite agree there is a good deal of point ini
the criticism that relief should not be given
according to geometrical lînes, and that if
areas which do not conformi to township lines
14879--iD

233

could readily be defined and relief be given
where relief is needed because of crop failure,
ib would be the proper method. 1 happened
to be a member of the Government when the
original Act was under consideration, and the
only ýreason 1 know of for the township idea
being adopted was the difficulty of administering the law in any other wsy.
While I think it is perfectly right that crop
failurre aTeas contiguous to an area entitled to
relief should be included, it seems to me quite
possible that another area which needs relief
just as badly, but which is only contigilous to
the contiguous area, would not be able to
share i that relief. I may be wrong in this.
There is in the amending Bill one change
which seems to me a step in the right direction.
There is, we will say, an area, in more than
one township, in which the general average
yield faîls below a certain figure. Within that
crop failure area there may be farms with a
yield of from twenty-frve to tbirty bushels to
the acre, yct the o'wners of those farms are
also entitled to the bonus. This, I think, is
absolutely wrong, and I take it that the amendment corrects that condition.
Right Hon. Mr. MELGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If it does not, it should.
That condition is absolutely unjust to the
taxpayers.
I neyer
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
understood that that was the îaw. It would
be perfectly absurd that relief should go to
any person wbo does not suifer damage.
I shoukl like to gct the namnes of the

This would
help the farmer who should be brought into
the assistance ares, and wvould eliminate the
farmer whose crop is fourteen bushels or
more to the acre. This seemed to be quite
acceptable to the members of the other
House.
I may mention in particular Mr.
Perley and, Mr. Diefenbaker. The only
criticism beard was that the amendment did
not go far enough. So I believe there is
virtue in tbis Bill, and that il should not
meet with any opposition in this House. 0f

suggest to my right honourable friend that
we refer il to committee, in order that the
Senate may be as fully informed as the Commons, which adopted the Bill unanimously.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I do not
intend t0 prolong this discussion. One would
gather from the bonourable leader's remarks
that this Bill oxcludes from crop failure
assistance thoso farmers whose crop yiold is
away above eight bushels t0 the acre. It
does not do that at ail. Obviously there was
provision for adding adjacent areas, if

SPECIAL WAIR REVENUE BILL
THIRD READING

The Senate, resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
third reading of Bill 88, an Act to amend the
Special War Revenue Act.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, the debate on this Bill was adjourned
at the request of my right honourable friend
after I had read a statement furniihed by
Mr. Finlayson to the Minister of Finance.
In suggesting that we adi ourn the dehate so
that he might more closely examine the statement submitted to the House, my right hionourable friend said this etatement did not
appear to cover his inquiry as to why the
department Was not applying clause 58 to
companies which were not registering. I drew
the attention of Mr. Finlayson to this inquiry,
and hie has answered as follows:

The position of the company from the United
St.ates which is at present violating the provisions of the latter Act is that 'hefore applying
for Dominion registry it had obtained a licence

from one of the provinces and has since obtained
a licence from a second province.
It has
refused to comp]y with the conditions for regis-

try under the Foreign Insurance Companies Act.

In the Committee on Banking and Commerce
a week ago I stated the reasons why prooeedings
have not been taken against the company under
section 58 of that Act; in the first place provincial reports available indicate no assets of
the company in Canada and the company may
be beyond our jurisdiction; in the second place,
proceedings under trie Foreign Insurance Companies Act would be made more difficult by the
existence of the apparent confiet between that
section and section 16 of the Special War
Revenue Act, seeing that the former Act makes
Dominion registry an essential pre-requisite
to
the transaction of -business in Canada, while

the latter Act gives at least some recognition
to, a provincial licence in the absence of
Dominion registry.
While on .my feet I may draw the attention
of the Senate to a statement contained in the

SENATE
memorandum concerning the decision of the
Privy Council. It is as follows:
In the decision of the Privy Council on the
Insurance Reference in 1931 it is stated:
"Their Lordships have n1o doubt that the
Dominion Parliament might pass an Act forbidding aliens to enter Canada or forbidding
them so to enter to engage in any business without a licence, and further they might furnish
rules for tieir conduct while in Canada, requiring them, e.g., to report at stated intervals,"
and legislation having such a prohibition as
its object shou l not on that ground be open

to attack. The decision later states that a
tax linked up witi an object which is illegal
must fall.
Honourable members will realize that their
Lordships are not closing the door against the
application of the authority or jurisdiction of
the Dominion Parliament, but are simply
saying what the Dominion Parliament might
do. The authority of the Dominion Parliament was isot challenged and absolutely set
aside by the decision. All the Privy Council
did was to say that the legislation as it
appeared in the reference failed in its form.
With that decision in view, the Department
of Justice had to consider under what form
the Parliament of Canada could exercise its
constitutional powers. The department was
very intent upon doing nothing that would
go counter to the letter and spirit of that
decision. In framing the Act which was
adopted by Parliament it surrounded itself
with all possible safeguards, and secured as
-ounsel one of the most learned men on the
subject of our constitutional rights, Hon. Mr.
Rowell. The question is: Will the Act
stand the test of the courts? The Department of Justice thinks it will. That opinion
is stated in the letter written by Mr. Edwards,
Deputy Minister of Justice, to Mr. Ilsley,
which I read yesterday, as follows:
Ottawa, June 4, 1941
Dear Mr. Ilsley,
Referring to your telephone conversation with
me, I beg to advise you that in the opinion of
this Department the Foreign Insurance Companies Act, 1932, is valid legislation of the
Parliament of Canada, and that it is within the
competence of Parliament to amend subsection
1 of section 16 of the Special War Revenue
Act, as enacted by section 1 of chapter 54 of
the statutes of 1932 by striking out the words
"or of any province thereof" in the fourteenth
line thereof.
Yours faithfully,
W. Stuart Edwards
D.M.J.
The Honourable J. L. Ilsley, K.C.,
Minister of Finance,
Ottawa.
The Government has done everything possible to make sure that our action is intra
vires. In these circumstances, and since the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Minister ias declared officially that section
4 will be submitted to the Supreme Court,
I urge that the Senate, should pass the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I think we should seriously
consider this taxation measure, in so far as
we have a constitutional right to do so,
particularly because it affects insurance, and
the insurance law of Canada is really the
creation of this Hoiuse, that is, to the extent
that any law is the creation of the House
which initiates it. I bave moved an amendusent merely to this effect, that two sections,
one of which is challenged as to its constitutionality by Ontario and New Brunswick and which as a consequence the Minister of Finance las undertaken on behalf
of the Governmsent to submit to the Supreme
Court of Canada, shall not go into effect until
the Supreme Court hands down its decision.
That is the whole effect of my amendment.
One would think it was not difficult to accept.
Let use first of all clear up two or three
things referred to in Mr. Finlayson's muemorandumn. Mc. Finlayson seemed bent upon
correcting soie dates which I gave here the
ohier niglit. As I was speaking I had rofer-

ence

lo a

suppleimsent

to the Sirois report, and

in glancing at this as it lay on my desk I
may have nsisread a date. I believe the supplemwent was prepared in part, if not altogether,
by an honourable member of this House,
the honourable gentleman from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin), and if I had quoted
exactly the figures appearing there I should
have been right. It does not matter a whit
that I was wrong on one date, and I do not
know that the slip was wortlh correcting. The
Reciprocal Insurance case was decided in 1924,
as Mr. Finiayson says. Then, giving the
impression that my dates were a mass of
errors, he goes on to correct me in this way:
The Insurance case arising out of the reference
by the province of Quebec was decided in 1931,
not 1923.
I did not say it was decided in 1923, and I
do not know why he ascribed that date to me.
I said, as can be seen by anyone reading my
remarks, that the legislation impugned was
passed in 1923.
He then seeks to correct me as te the date
of the Act which exempts Lloyd's from obligations thereunder, and he says it was passed in
1934, not 1932. It is true that the exemption
of Lloyd's was done in 1934, but the Actthat is the Foreign Insurance Companies Act,
which I was describing-was passed in 1932.
I had something to do with that.
I pass now to Mr. Finlayson's statement
that the Boston Mutual did not apply for a
federal licence. It may be, though I cannot

239

JUNE 11, 1941
speak of my own knowledge, that he is right
in saying this. However, my information,
which comes from Mr. Evan Gray, the eompany's solicitor, is that an application was
made and refused. The company may not
have applied formally, but he stated definitely
to me that it had sought to get a federal
licence, and was refused for the reason that
under its constitution, similar to that of the
factory mutuals, it could not comply with our
Act by making in Canada a deposit applicable
only to the protection of Canadian policyholders. Its deposit had to be for the protection of all its policyholders. The company
did not set out to defy Canadian law; its constitution simply prevented it from complying
with our Act. And it could not come under the
special provisions which we had made applicable to the factory mutuals, because these
provisions described the companies as fire
companies, and this is not a fire company.
All this I explained before, and I pass now
from Mr. Finlayson's memorandum.
Let me see if I can get the situation clearly
before the House. We have legislation prohibiting any foreign or British companyfor, in the eyes of our law, a British company
is an alien-from doing business in Canada
unless it has a federal licence. But we made
an exception of Lloyd's, by permitting them to
come in and do business on a provincial
licence, without requiring them to make a
deposit in compliance with the federal law,
for the reason that under their constitution
they too are prevented from restricting their
Canadian deposit to the protection of Canadian policyholders only; and for the additional reason that Lloyd's solidity, which took
root and gathered strength over centuries,
was. such that we could not with sincerity say
it was necessary to require of them a deposit
applicable to Canadian policyholders only,
in order to be sure that such policyholders
would be paid in case of loss. We could not
honestly question that Lloyd's were responsible and would pay any just claim.
Hon. Mr. EULER: A policyholder might
have to sue in Great Britain, though.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. That is
all provided for. He can sue here. If Lloyd's
refused to pay after a policyholder got judgment, I do not know just what would happen.
But there never has been a case. We were
either right or wrong in exempting Lloyd's.
They have a huge business, not only in
Great Britain and on the continent of Europe,
but all over the world, and we made an
exception in their case because it was quite
impossible for them to restrict their Canadian
deposit to the protection of Canadian policyholders. But, as an indication of good faith,

Lloyd's to-day keep very large deposits in
Canada. These sums do not come within the
purview of our Insurance Act, but they would
be exigible under execution of any judgment
obtained by a Canadian. This is aside from
the point, and I mention it only because the
exception granted to Lloyd's, which I think
was quite right and necessary, has been
dragged into this memorandum. After all,
the object of our insurance law is not to erect
a great structure and place the control of
everything under the charge of someone, no
matter how able, honest and efficient. It is
for no other purpose than to afford such
reasonable protection to Canadian insurers as
Parliament deems wise.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But it should
be remembered that the Canadian insurers
are paying 10 per cent, while Lloyd's escape
the tax. This represents a considerable sum
on the millions of dollars of insurance they
have accepted.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The leader
of the House gets impatient. My principal
object in rising is to distinguish between the
taxation feature and the doing-business
feature. It is the first I am still dealing
with. I shall come to the second, and I
have very clear views on it, and I do not
think they will be far from those of the
leader of the House.
Now our law prohibits any company doing
business unless it has a federal licence. We
enacted it, believing we had power to do so
under our jurisdiction in respect of aliens,
and I argued before this House that it was
within our constitutional rights.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

That is clause 58?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

I thought it
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
carried the assent of my right honourable
friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly
it did. I think I argued even more strongly
then that we had' those rights, and Mr.
Finlayson was thoroughly convinced. I have
not disputed that position to-day, nor have I
at any time in discussing this matter.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wonder whether
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), understanding Lloyd's as he does,
could tell me whether there is any truth in
the statement that Lloyd's evade 75 to 80 per
cent of the claims made against them; also,
that Lloyd's each year canvass all magistrates and judges in Canada for their insurance.
Is there anything in that?

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have never
heard the allegation made before, and therefore I do not think there is anything in it
whatever. I certainly should have heard if
there were, for I am closely connected with the
insurance business.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
experience with Lloyd's.

I have had some

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may
be, but I have not heard they are more disposed to dispute claims than are any other
companies in the insurance business. We are
in constant competition with them. They are
not allies, they are competitors, and indeed
the most aggressive and threatening of any.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: After the judge in
my case said Lloyd's should pay, they sent
me a cheque, which I cashed. Three or four
days later the bank told me it had been
dishonoured.
I have
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
respect for the honourable senator. All I can
say is that there must be something wrong.
Lloyd's cheques are not dishonoured.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is 75 to 80
per cent evasion of payment of claims.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If that were
the case, they could not continue to do
business.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They do it at 20
per cent less than any other company.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hold no brief
for Lloyd's. If one may refer to one's personal responsibilities, I would say theirs is
just as aggressive and efficient competition as
one could fear in the insurance field.
I return to a discussion of clause 58.
Please keep this in mind. At the time all
insurance companies doing business here which
by their constitution could comply with our
federal law were willing and eager to do so.
They said: "We want federal supervision. We
find it helps us in our business." Only those
who by their constitution could not apply
stayed out. Therefore we felt somewhat freer
in passing this legislation. We did not do it
over the protest of anybody. We assume that
It is not now
the legislation is valid.
impugned. I do not want anyone to understand me as expressing with any air of finality
the opinion that it will not be overturned
by a Privy Council decision. I would not go
so far, but I assume for all purposes here that
it is valid.
The question is why it is not enforced if
practical enforcement is one of the objects

of this Bill, as Mr. Finlayeon says it is.
Ris memorandum read to-day deals with that,
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

if I caught it correctly. His memorandum in
yesterday's Hansard says nothing on the
point. The purport of the answer is that these
people, not being Canadians, may be beyond
the jurisdiction of our courts. Well, I am not
at all in doubt as to why the explanation comes
so late: that is because it is so poor.

DANDURAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why, any
company doing business in Canada under
provincial licence has to have its legal representative here under the provincial law. He
can be served, and process served upon him is
service upon the company in any action
whatever. If this law is good, the Government of Canada can take action in the courts
of Quebec or Ontario, or, I presume, in the
Exchequer Court, and ask for an injunction
restraining the company from doing business.
Will any lawyer here suggest the Government
cannot take such action against a company
doing business in defiance of a federal statute?
Is the company not reachable? Of course it
is reachable. But, though it has been doing
business since 1934, no action has been taken
or attempted. We all know Mr. Finlayson.
He is not a weak or subservient official; he is
not pliant in the hands of anybody. His
attitude towards a company that defies the
law of Canada in respect of insurance is the
bas
lion's attitude against an aggressor.
anyone in his mind any reason why action
is not taken? Suppose Mr. Finlayson took
action solely for the fine, not for a mandamus,
and got judgnent for $5,000. Does anyone
think that company could continue doing business in Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

He gives the

so that we may get it exactly. He says:

business in Canada you specify the particular
business, and you thereby seek to effect a
purpose more important and paramount, you
usurp a provincial field. If the other purpose
appears from the general terms of the legislation, the whole piece of legislation being
regarded as the paramount object, then, even
though you may debar aliens, you cannot, do
it for the purpose of effecting this Act." That
will be the argument made against the clause,
and he would indeed be a brave counsel who
would feel absolutely sure on the point.
All this is not so very important, because
it is not that clause which will be submitted
to the Privy Council. It is another clause.
It is a clause in our Special War Revenue
Bill, which strikes out of the Act the words
"or from any province of Canada." The
effect is that any company coming within the
whole range of that section doing business
in this Dominion without a federal licence
renders its customers liable to a tax of 10
per cent on the premiums paid that company.
If it has a provincial licence, they will be
liable after this legislation is enacted. Up
to now they have not been. So far as
taxes were concerned it was deemed to be
entitled ta do business the same as a company
having a federal licence. Now, if it has a
provincial licence, we say, "You will have to
pay the tax."
Before I go further I call attention to thi.s,
though, that the previous amendment provided for in this Bill has the effect of exempting Lloyd's from the tax. I hope the House

provincial licence in the absence of Dominion

I do not think Mr. Finlayson is very much
worried that in a legal action against a company for definitely violating section 58 of our
Foreign Insurance Companies Act he might
have difficulty because another statute, the
Special War Revenue Act, implies that the company may have a provincial licence. The
Insurance Act stands by itself, and the section
is manifest, clear, mandatory, containing no
exception whatever.
There is nothing left, then, but the first
reason. He says the company bas no assets in
Canada and may be beyond our jurisdiction.
Whether it bas any assets or not, it must
answer to a writ of mandamus. And if it is
ordered to discontinue business, it must do so,
or everyone here doing business for it becomes
liable to imprisonment. He says the company
is beyond our jurisdiction. In what respect?
If it does any business in Canada, that act is
within the purview of our law. The mandamus applies at once; the law is upheld, and
you get judgment. Can any company continue to do business in Canada with unsatisfied
judgment against it? Of course it cannot.
Imagine an insurance company trying to do
business under those conditions! It is absurd.
It could not get business. Furthermore, what
kind of time would its officers have? No;
that is not the reason why this company has
not been prosecuted.
Perhaps this has something to do with it.
True, the Justice Department writes: "We are

more than it taxes. I think I should be safe
in saying that the tax on Lloyd's business
in Canada would be hundreds of times the
$400 odd that will come out of this little
company. So it is by no means certain that
Ontario and New Brunswick are net right. If
they are, surely it is inequitable to frighten
off the customers of this company and put it
out of business; and that is what yen are
going te do. You are going to tell its customers: "Here, you are paying to this company money on which you may be taxed 10
per cent if this Bill is held valid." Under
such circumstances will the company get
many customers between now and the time
when the decision of the court is rendered?
I think net. Yeu are doing this company a
very great injustice. It is a small concern
as regards its business in Canada. As I say,
you are doing it an injustice. Is there any
need of that? Why net hold the operation
of this measure in suspense until the courts
say whether it is valid or net?
Now let me say a word on the necessity of
distinguishing between an insurance law and
a taxation law. They are entirely different
things. When we exempted Lloyd's from putting up deposits, we did so, rightly or wrongly,
on the ground tbat the object of rcquiring
deposits in Canada did not apply to Lloyd's;
fhat, Lloyd's having done business over the
centuries, and having a constitution which of
necessitv is world-wide in its applicability,
they could not make deposits applicable to
only one end of the world.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Would the right
honourable gentleman just tell the House
what Lloyd's are?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know that I can. I should like to be able to
do so. Lloyd's are an organization of insurers in various units, with a central unit in a
certain street in London where the whole idea
of this class of insurance took form about two
centuries ago. The principle of operation is
this. There is an apportionment of risk in
accordance with the total accepted by the
underwriter. The risk is spread over all the
various units of Lloyd's; A underwrites
£1.000, B £15,000, C some other amount, and
so on, until the whole sum is underwritten.
That is the principle of operation. You can sec
from what I have already said that it would
not be practicable for an organization of
such class and character to have deposits
applicable onily to insurance in certain parts.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Does the right honourable gentleman understand that the deposits
constitute membership?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. To
be a member of Lloyd's one has to contribute
one's share to the great central assets of ·the
organization, which are answera.ble for all
liabilities in all parts of the world.
We had to decide whether we would permit
Lloyd's to do business in this country or not,
and we felt that we could not in a serions
mood say we must have a special deposit
applicable here, because since the birth of
Lloyd's there has been no judgment against
them that has not been paid. That was demonstrated before the committee. That is one
thing. But taxation is something different.
If it is true, as I am inclined to think it is,
that companies net resident in Canada, and
therefore not subject to our special income
and corporation tax laws, may be in a favourable position to reach out for business in the
Dominion, we should have no hesitation in
taxing them; and the best way to tax them
is to tax their customers. And that is the
way it bas been donc.
As I view the situation, there is no objection
at all to taxing Lloyd's customers. I do net
see how they can plead for exemption, especially if we are Laxing the customers of the
factory mutuals on the ground tiat we cannet reach the companies under our regular
taxation laws, and must reach then under
other laws. If we reach all alike, no court
can say our enactments are not tax legislation.
Clearly they would be. As advised at present.
I feel certain it is proper taxation and should
apply generally to all companies which invade
the field, or to their customers. I think I
have made myself plain. I am not pleading
for any exemption; I am pleading against it.
If we are in the taxation sphere now and are
deciding what is the right thing to do in the
matter of, and for the purpose of, taxation,
we should make our law apply te everybody
in that sphere of business.

courts right off. I shall not try te erect
myself as a legal arbitrator, but may I say

Your exemption of Lloyd's imperils your

taxation general and you will achieve something. You w*ill be able te tell the courts
with a straight face that your object is te

through, is just. Then the other side will

I do net think I am unreasonable in asking
that this measure be postponed until we
secure a decision. It seems te me the Government might well consider putting this measure
into such form that it will be taxation law
and will have no other purpose than taxation.

:So I do net need te move it again. It is:

That this Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be amended by adding the following
as section 29 thereof:
Sections 3 and 4 of this Act shall not corne
into effect until proclamation by the Governor
in Council, and such proclamation shall not be
issued until section 4 of this Act shall have been
submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada for
the purpose of having the judgment of the said
Court on the constitutionality of said section 4,
and said judgment bas been given.
Only section 4 needs te be submitted; but
of course the Government does net want
section 3 unless section 4 is upheld.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is on the motion for
the third reading of Bill 88, an Act to amend

the Special War Revenue Act, te which it is
moved in amendment-

Some Hon. SENATORS: Dispense!
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, this amendment comes before us,
I suggest, as a result of the official statement
of the Minister of Finance, which I conveyed
te this House, that these two clauses would
be subrnitted to the Supreme Court.
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN:

Only sec-

tion 4 needs to be submitted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Section 4 is to
be submitted te the Supreme Court, by
reference. The Superintendent of Insurance
told us in committee he was convinced that
ne collections could be made under sections 3
and 4 before next March, when réturns would
corne in from the insurance companies, and
that by that time a judgment would be
obtained from the Supreme Court.
We now have an amendmaent which seeks
te suspend the operation of section 4 pending
the delivery of judgment. I should have little
hesitancy in agreeing to that amendment if
this were net a money bill and if the object of
section 4 were net the levying of taxation. My
right honourable friend bas dilated on the
fact that this is a taxation measure. I fear
that to vote for the amendment would be te
invade the rights of the House of Commons in
the taxation field, because if the amendment
were adopted the tax contemplated by section 4
might net be collectable as early as it otherwise would. I am quite clear that the Senate
bas no right te interfere with a bill which
provides ways and means of meeting expenditure by the Government. That is my view
of the amendment, but, as I do not know how
the other House would look upon it, I have
no objection te its being adopted here and
sent over there for consideration. At all
events that House will know what the Senate's
opinion is. I do net mean that the arnendment would represent the Senate's unanimous

opinion, for some senators, including myself,
have felt we should be satisfied with the statement of the Minister of Finance. If we agreed
to his proposal, no collections would be made
under these sections pending judgment by
the court, and the seetions themselves would
not be suspended.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, another issue has arisen. I appreciate the attitude of the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and am
very glad he has taken it. What I say now
is only said so that the other House and the
Government may give- it what consideration
it is worth. It is true that as a matter of
practice we do not amend money bills, and
it is clear that this is a money bill. I do not
admit that we have not the right to amend
money bills. In fact, if my memory is correct,
the Senate committee which studied this subject found that this House was not restrained
at all in its powers to amend any bill, and
that the only restraint applying to us and not
to the other House is that a money bill cannot be introduced here. Nevertheless, I take
the position I have always taken, that,
regardless of our legal rights, we should be
unwise to interfere with money bills by
amendment. We have, of course, the right to
defeat money bills, if we so choose, but we
should be very careful in exercising that right.
I can conceive of cases where it ought to be
exercised. But in this case we are really not
amending a money bill at all. That we have
the right to postpone operation of any money
bill, if we think postponement is in the public
interest and we choose so to do, there is no
question. Then we surely have the right to
postpone operation of a small part of a
money bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

It

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, it would
not.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If you suspend the
operation of the two sections, you cannot
collect the revenue.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the two
sections are proclaimed, they take effect from
the date set out in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Then they would be
retroactive.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The various
sections of the Bill take effect from the
respective dates specified. We are not amending a money bill in the sense of invading
rights of the House of Commons in respect
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of taxation, for the amendment merely seeks
a postponement of the two sections. That is
my first point.
There is another point, which I should like
the Government to take into account particularly. If this amendment is net passed,
a very serious injury will be done to a conpany with which perhaps we have no right
to interfere at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend has already dilated on that
point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The company's
customers would at once shy away. I know
that is what I should do if I were a customer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not ready
to admit that in adopting this amendment we
should net be touching a clause whose object
is the levying of taxation, whatever the
amount, whether it be one dollar or a million
dollars. But since we have -discussed the
matter to this point, I am agreeable to leaving it to the Commons to decide whether they
will agree to the amendment.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, may
I just add a few words? The other day the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) challenged our right to amend
the Unemployment Insurance Act. That gave
me an opportunity of perusing some of the
material on our constitutional powers. I have
read the report which on May 9, 1918, was
presented to the Senate by the special conmittee under the chairmanship of Senator
W. B. Ross. It seems to me it would be worth
while to place this report on Hansard, because
I believe it is good to be reminded now and
then, not of our disabilities or incompetence,
but of our rights. The report is as follows:
The special committee appointed to consider
the question of determining what are the rights
of the Senate in matters of financial legislation, and whether under the provisions of the
British North America Act, 1867, it is permissible, and to what extent, or forbidden, for the
Senate to amend a bill embodying financial
clauses (money bill), have the honour to make

Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators,
I move:
That the Bill be not now read a third time,
but that Bills 88 and 101 be consolidated as
follows:
To subsection 3 of section 80 of the Special
War Revenue Act, as enacted by clause 8 of
Bill 88, add the following (being the proviso
contained in Bill 101):
Provided, however, that the foregoing exemption shall not extend to the goods mentioned
in paragraph 2 of Schedule II to this Act when
used in the nanufacturing of the goods mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 8 of Sehedule I to
this Act.
And that Bill 101 be not further proceeded

The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, the question is now on the motion
for the third reading of Bill 88 as amended and
consolidated with Bill 101. Is it your pleasure
to adopt the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and Bill 88
as amended was read the third time, and
passed.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
THIRD READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 87, anu Act to amend the
Income War Tax Act.

He said: Honourable senators, whien this
Bill was before us yesterday my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) asked
for certain information concerning sections
4 and 29. In response to my request the
Commissioner of Income Tax has sent me the
following memorandum:
Re Section 4 (m):
This definition removes the limitation of
$14,000 on earned income, which formerly was
the maximum amount of such income recognized for the purposes of the Act, as all income
in excess of $14,000, irrespective of its nature,
was treated as investment income.
Hon. Mr. COTE.

The previous definition limiting earned
income to a maximum of $14,000 was an
artificial statutory definition which was not
true to fact. It was decided to remove the
artificiality and adhere to the common acceptance of what is earned income and what is
investment income.
The proposed amendment brings the law in
line with the facts.
The rate on investment income is altered
from a graduated rate commencing at 2 per
cent on such income exceeding $5,000 and rising
to 10 per cent on such income exceeding
$200,000, to a flat rate of 4 per cent.
The new rates of tax on all income, as contained in section 1 of the Bill, have been
graduated so steeply that they take care of the
ability-to-pay basis so far as graduation is
concerned. It was therefore felt that investment income should bear an additional tax, but
not an additional graduated tax, so the flat
4 per cent rate is imposed in respect of purely
investment income, without exemption, beyond
the usual marital status exemption.
Re Section 29:
This section makes taxâble a gift to the
wife or husband or to a minor child of the
taxpayer, which formerly was not subject to
gift tax.
It was formerly not subject to gift tax
because, although the transfer was actually
made, the income from the property transferred
continued to be taxed in the hands of the
donor and it was not intended to also impose
a gift tax.
A gift fron a husband to a wife, or vice
versa, or to a minor child, is a succession of
property and now that there has been introduced a Succession Duty Act the need for the
exemption from gift tax no longer exists, for
if on such a transfer the gift tax is now paid
it will be the equivalent of paying a succession
duty. The sane gift would be subject to
succession duty if the gift were made within
three years of death, but the succession duty
payable would be reduced by the amount of
the gift tax already paid. Hence the reason
for the enactment of section 29, which in effect
imposes a gift tax on the transfer of property,
which heretofore did not exist, and the gift
tax paid is to be a credit against any subsequent succession duty which may become payable in respect of the property so transferred.
With these explanations I move the third
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the explanation as to the
gift tax is entirely satisfactory. I quite see
the equity and wisdom of the tax. I understand, of course, that the $1,000 exemption
still remains.
I understand Mr. Elliott's interpretation of
the law regarding section 4. There is no
doubt that the 514.000 umaximum of salary
exempted from the special tax because it was
salary and not investment income was arbitrary.
But I object to any distinction being made
as to income from whatever source. I think
it is fundamentally wrong and grossly unjust.
The unfairness was modified a little by the

JTJNE 11, 1941
$14,000 limitation wbich previously applied,
even though it was arbitrary. Now the
unfairness; is worse than ever. To say that a
man who has saved something and is living
on the income from his earnings,' however
small that income may be, should be taxed
more than a person who is drawing 850,000 as
general mnanager of a bank, or $100,000 for
ranning a pulp niill-well, the justice of such
discrimination simply cannot be comprehended. There is no defence for it whatever,
and 1 ur-ge upon the Government the striking
out of that very unf air, iniquitous and
indefensible distinction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think 1 arn
repeating for the second or third time tihat
this legisiation is aiways subject to review
because -of difficulty of interpretation on the
part of a certain num:ber of persans affected
by an enactment. The Minister of Finance
bas expressed a desire to remove any valid
objection that may be raised, and so from
year -to year to improve the Bill, if it becomes
necessary -te do so.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senaýtors,
Ican see some point in the objection of my
right lionôurable friend, but 1 oaninot go with
bim ail the way. For example, compare the
case of a man who lias inheritcd wealtli upon
which he receives a return with the case of a
man who receives a substantial salary. I think
saine consideration should be given to the mnan
who has really earned bis income by hais own
efforts, as compared with the man who lias
inlierited bis wealthl and bas done nobhing
whatsoever to earn the return which lie gets
from bis investinents. I tliink it is quite fair
ta make a distinction in sucli cases.
Riglit Hlon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do flot deny
the justice, in general, of tlie -observations of
my hoinourable friend, but, on the ather liand,
the person wlio inherits lias mnade a great
sacrifice of capital in thse f orin of succession
duty.
Hon. Mr. EULER: He did not earn it.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know. But
if you do away with the rigbt ta provide for
your children, you are doing away with a
great part of what is wortli whule in life. I
would flot abj ect at aiýl to this super-tax being
made applicable te everybody, but I abj ect Zo
placing thse fellow with a fancy salary in a
class above tlie feiiow wlio bas earned lis
way in life and lias, by bis own tlirift, obtained
sornetling to live on.
The motion was agreed te, and thse Bill
was read tlie tliird time, and passed.

LABOUR DEPARTMENT

BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved thse third
reading of Bill 100, an Act to amend the
Labour Departinent Act.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I have bad turne te secure thse information I desired in relation te tbis Bill, and
there is ne reason, s0 far as 1 amn concerned,
wby it sliould net get tisird reading. I tried
to make it clear yesterday tisat I bad ne
objection whatever te the person appointed
te tise position new being created. I desire
aIse te make it quite clear that se far as
tbe Labour Department, or any other department which requires assistance at this time,
is concerned, I thýink it shouid get. that
assistance without any question and at whatever cbst is necessary.
Thse objection I had te thse measure was
tbat it crested a new position in tbe public
service. A furtber objection which I bave
now is tisat it does not in any way at al
define the duties or responsibilities of the
position. I have taken the trouble te go
through the Estimates of ail the departments,
and I have found in ne other department
a position comparable te thse one being created
by this Bill, wbicb, if I remember correctly,
is tbat of "Associate Deputy Minister."
I arn not going te worry tbe House witb the
details of the set-up in aIl departments. I
bave selected just tbree and have made a iist
of the cisief officers responsibie for their
I think every bonourabie
administration.
member wiii agree that I have seiected representative departinents-- departments which are
very large, whicb perform a multipiicity of
duties, and therefore require huge staffs,
as compared witli thse one ive are considering
at tbe present time. Bear in mind that I arn
dealing only with administrative officers, bigh
up in the service, wbo get salaries ranging
from 88,000 te $12,000 a year. Many officiais
under tbem are receiving amounts varying
from 83,000 ta $6,000 or 87,000, or in some
cases even $10,000, but tbey are net înciuded
among thse executive officials. In thse Department of Finance I find two men wlio are
in this category: tlie Deputy Minister, who
receives 812,000 a year, and tbe Assistant
Deputy Minister, at $6,300. Ahl otisers are of
lower rank. In tise Departrnent of Agriculture,
wbich is enormous, and wbich bas a great
variety of very necessary and. very important
work te do, we bave a Deputy Minister at
810,000 a year, an Assistant Deputy Minister
at 85,100, and a General Executive Assistant
at $5,400. Just isere, I may say tbat the
position of Assistant Deputy Minister is quite

248

SENATE

usual throughout the departments, though net
universal, and in many departments there are
General Executive Assistants who receive
salaries of from $4,500 to, say, $5,500. In the
Public Works Department-we ail know that
department and the work it covers-I find
there are two, and, only two, officials administering its work: the Deputy Minister, who
receives $10,000 a year, and an Assistant
Deputy Minister at $4,620. From this it will
be seen that there are two men in the Finance
Department at a cost of $18,300 a year; three
in the Department of Agriculture at a cost of
$20,500, and two in the Department of Public
Works at a cost of $14,620. I do not wish
to mislead the House in any way. There are
many other important officials who receive
amounts varying, as I bave said, from $3,000
to $5,000 or $6,000, or even $10,000; but they
are net executive officials in the sense in which
I am applying the term.
On turning to the Labour Department I find
in the current Estimates provision for a Deputy
Minister at $10,000, an Associate Deputy
Minister at $9,000, an Assistant Deputy Minister at $5,220, and a General Executive
Assistant at 84,200-a total of $28,420.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Deputy at $4,000.

And a retired

Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is to say, the
administrative force in the Labour Department
as provided for in the Estimates this year will
cost $28,420 as against $18,000 odd for the
Finance Department, $20,500 for the Department of Agriculture, and $14,620 for the
Department of Public Works.
I am merely stating this to give the House
a view of the situation in the three departments I have referred to-a situation which
is typical of that in other departments. I do
not in any sense mean to imply that the
Department of Labour should not in the
present situation spend $28,000 for administrative work. It is quite possible that at
the present time the situation is such that
the expenditure is fully justified, and that
even further expenditure may be necessary.
I trust I have made myself clear in that
respect.
My whole point bas been that there is always
danger in creating new positions of this
character. What is the meaning of "Associate
Deputy Minister?" Is he a Deputy Minister?
Has be all the power and responsibility of a
Deputy Minister? Is this going to be a permanent position? If so, I fear-and I think
my fear is justified, because I have had a
long association, extending over many years,
with the public service, both as a member of
that service and as a Minister of the CrownHon. Mr. CALDER.

that once a step of this kind is taken it will
be used as a precedent for similar appointments in other departments in the future.
Any honourable member of this House who
has had experience of administrative work
over a long period of years knows the attitude
of the heads of departments, and is aware
of the danger of creating such positions.
I have only this to add. In passing this
Bill we are simply ratifying what bas already
been done, for the appointment bas been made.
The salary of this official is shown in the
Estimates, and I have no doubt at all that
it bas been paid. This being so, we are somewhat late, and there is nothing we can do
at the present time to help the situation.
The Government bas decided what it wants,
and it has now obtained what it wants. Quite
possibly there are reasons why such an appointment should be made at this time. I understand-and everybody seems to agree on thisthat in the Department of Labour we have a
very fine Deputy Minister, a man of excellent
qualifications who is doing excellent work,
but whom we are likely to lose. Perhaps
this measure is being enacted at this time
merely for the purpose of holding a man
who is a credit to his office. I do hope, however, that at the next session of Parliament
this new high office will disappear from the
public service; otherwise, I feel bound to say
that the chances are that within the next ten
years we shall have in Canada many Associate
Deputy Ministers who will not be required
at all.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, in case there is not another
opportunity, I want to make a suggestion to
the Government. It really bas not much
to do with this Bill.
I understand that the Government is continuing to make advances in connection with
the housing scheme. We have advanced some
millions for that purpose. I never was
enthusiastic about the project-far from itbut the purpose of it was said to be to help
furnisb employment during the depression
years. To-day, in view of the war and the
general scarcity of men, I cannot imagine why
the Government continues the expenditure
on this scheme. It seems to me it should have
stopped it long ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman refers toRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The housing
programme and the advances made under it.
I know that certain companies would like to
sec the plan continued, but in my view it is
not in the national interest to continue it

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, the only item remainiog on our
Order Paper is for tbe third reading of Bill
98, an Act to authorize the provision of
rnoneys to meet certain capital expenditures
made and capital indebtedness incurred by
the Canadian National Railways System during the calendar year 1941, to provide for
tbe refunding of financial obligations and to
authorîze the guarantee by His Majesty of
certain securities to be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company. I arn quite
sure that there would not be time for us to
pass this Bill by six o'clock. Is it the wisb
of honourable members tbat we should sit
this evening, or adjourn until to-morrow
morning?

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:- If we bave
enougb work to warrant it, I arn quite prepared
to meet in the morning.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We shall have
Bill 98 to work upon. 1 do flot know wbat

meantime. I arn told there are two bis of
very littie consequence, and the Ministers
say these will not cause any criticism. If we
met to-morrow rnorning at, say, haif past
eleven, we could deal with Bill 98, and then
be in a position to know what to expect frorn
the other buse.

WITHHOLDING 0F EXEATS
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, some rnonths ago I called
attention to the inability of young Canadian
wornen, eager to serve in sorne capacity in
the auxiliary women's service- of England,
to get exeats from the Government of Canada
to enable thern to proceed overseas to fill
positions already granted them, subjeet only
to medicai examination in England. I have
heard nothing on the subject since, beyond
receipt of a letter from the Departmeut of
External Affairs telling me about an Order
in Council passed on June 4, a year ago,
under which women are not permitted to
go to the British Isles or the war area. unless
tbey are part of the actual military, naval
or air services, or unless England is their
home and it is a case of the exercise of
legal compassion.
A considerable number of these eager young
wornen have aiready been accepted, subject
only to, medical examination, and one would
think it would not bave been difficuit to
arrange with the British war services to acoept
medical examinations rnade bere by doctors
approved by such a body as our Pension

250

SENATE

Board; but apparently nothing has been done.
These women, many of them born in England,
are extremely irked that they cannot do anything, although the auxiliary services overseas
have been virtually begging them to corne
so that they may be accepted for work.
Now I find there has been established in
the United States an air training scheme for
British airmen-an event of some significance
in view of our recent past. The purpose is
to send back eight thousand men with the
limited training they can secure in that country, such training, of course, being British. In
connection with the establishment of this plan
there have come to the United States a
considerable number of members of the
Women's Auxiliary Air Force of Britain. While
they can cross the Atlantic this way for
the purpose of rendering essential services
to the Air Force of Britain in the United
States, Canadian women are unable by any
means to go to the help of their sisters in
England. Can one imagine anything more
preposterous?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand
that women from Great Britain will cross
over?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is quite
explainable if there are too many in Great
Britain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What
leader of the. Government says is that
would not cross over unless there were
many. I would rather say they would
cross over unless they were needed.

the
they
too
not

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is an inference. But surely the United States, with

130,000,000 peopleRight Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: But they cannot enlist in the force. The United States are
not in the war.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, but the
United States are receiving British airmen
for training.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In compliance
with international law they are being trained
in civilian clothes, and the women's auxiliary
services are needed to assist them. These
members of the auxiliary services are not in
the United States, but have to come from
England. They come, not because they are
eager to leave England, but because they are
needed in the United States.
My authority for what I say is a Canadian
Press dispatch dated Ottawa, May 31.
It
Riaht Hon. Mir. MEIGHEN.

Fresh strength for the fighting forces has
come to this continent-airmen, sailors and
soldiers, and United States-bound girls of the
Women's Auxiliary Air Force.
Guarded by mighty units of the British fleet,
they sailed the north Atlantic while the greatest
naval battle of the war was fought in those
waters-the action which saw the loss of
H.M.S. Hood and the avenging destruction of
Germany's battleship Bismarck.
In. the varied contingent of air, sea and land
fighters came the first group of Royal Air
Force fledglings who will be trained in the
United States under the plan announced at
Washington May 29 by the United States War
Department.
They will be followed at intervals by other
flights until 8,000 have been trained in the next
year. The instruction course begins June 7.
Most of the blue-clad youths in the first
group were destined for service in air crews.
They did not know their destination in the
United States.
Practically all the airmen were in uniform,
but all had been issued with mufti, and it was
indicated they would doff their uniform before
entering the U.S. to conform with the international amenities.
This does seem an odd state of affairs.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman a question? Is there
any indication that there is a dearth of the
kind of assistance these Canadian women
could give?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Such
indication is contained in the messages which
I have already reported to the House, messages froin these auxiliary services telling
how desirous they are of having these girls.
A girl in Weyburn, whose case I have in
mind now, was actually accepted, but has not
been able to get out of Canada. The department is simply adhering to the letter of this
Order in Council of June 4. Its terms are
apparently more important than any real
service.
Hon. Mr. EULER: From the fact that
women were being allowed to go from England
to the United States, I thought there might
be a sufficiency of that kind of help in
England now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There has
to be, and, besides, England bas to send
women to the United States. Why is it that
we cannot at least supply the help needed
in the United States and in that way save
the women two trips-across the ocean and
back? I presume, though, we have no means
of training women here.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is it the right honourable gentleman's suggestion that Canadian
women might go to the United States?

JUNE 12, 1941
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes, if they
could be trained here. I do flot know whether
we have any organization to train them. We
might have been expected to have some such
organization, but 1 doubt that we have. In
any event, it would seem that we should allow
Canadian women to go to England. So far
as I know, there is no suggestion that their
expenses be paid. Those I have hes.rd of
are ready to pay their own expenses if they
are permitted to go.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I may say that my right honourable friend's inquiry was flot left unanswered
by the department. An answer was sent to
me and I should have presented it to the
Huse, but at the same time I received a
copy of a letter from the department addressed
to my right honourable friend, which covered
virtually the whole situation. If my right
honourable friend so desires, I can place the
answer on Hansard this afternoon.
The information given by my right honourable friend is new to me. As to our furnishing any number of women to play the role
that is now being played by British women
by the side of British airmen who are undergoing training in the United States, I cannot
understand why this could flot be done if
the British Government notified our Government of what was going on. I will obtain
from the bansard reporters a copy of my
rigbit honourahie friend's statement and bring
it to the attention of my colleagues at the
Council meeting whieh is te, be held this
morning. I am surprised that the British
Government or authorities on the other side
have not called upon these Canadian nurses
and hospital attendants, as I take them to be,
who have offered to serve in England. However, as I say, the matter is new to me. I
wi]l bring an answer to my right honourable
friend this afternoon.
WAR EQUIPMENT PRODUCTION IN
CANADA-ATTITUDE OF
BRITISH FIRMS
INQUIRY

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, on the first of April, which
is quite a while ago, I gave notice that I
should
*''inquire of the Government whether representations of any kind were made, prior to the
evacuation of Dunkirk, by the Canadian
Government to the British Government in
respect of refusai, reluctance or delay of
British firms to supply necessary plans, specifications or other essential data to Canadian
firms, to be used in the production of war
equipment or munitions of any kind.

251

That inquiry, it will be observed, applies
only to representations, if any, made by the
Canadian Government to the British Government as respects certain conduct complained
of, on the part of British firms.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my right
honourable friend made a motion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I made a
motion on the subsequent day as follows:
That an Order of the Senate do issue for a
copy of ail representations, letters, documents,
telegrams, or other communications, passing,
prior to the evacuation of Dunkirk, from the
Canadian Government to the British Government, with respect in any way to the refusal,
reluctance or delay of British firms to supply
necessary plans, specifications or other essential
data to Canadian firms, to be used in the production of war equipment or munitions of any
kind.
Again I emphasize that the motion, which
passed this House, calîs only for production of
documents, telegrams or letters passing from
the Canadian Government to the British
Government. No return has been produced in
response to this Order of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANBURAND: I may say that
for the last two weeks, at least, I have had
before me the statement which that motion
called for, but from day to day 1 have deferred
presenting it to the bouse, because we have
been very busy on important matters coming from the Commons. However, my conscience was at peace, since 1 had submitted
to my right honourable fricnd the statement
itself, which he read in my own room. Incidentally, this explains why one evening we were
fifteen minutes late in taking our seats.
I will produce the answer this afternoon at
three o'clock.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGRIEN: I want my
honourable friend to be a littie fairer than
that. Neyer d-id he show to me anything which
was in any respectHon. Mr. DANDURAND: We may discuss
that this afternoon.
Right bon. Mr. MEIGREN: I do not care
to let the discussion appear in Hansard in
this ineomplete form. Neyer did he show to
me anything which was in any respect either
an answer to my inquiry or a response by
the Government to the motion which passed
this bouse. be showed me some communication, written, I think, by the Prime Minister,
from the Canadian Government to the British
Government, telling how we should be prepared to make war products, that Canada
had the facilities, and so on. This had nothing at ail to do with the point, and I told
my honourable friend so at the time. First
of ahl, I asked whether or not any complaint
was ever made to the British Government

SENATE
with regard to alleged misconduet of certain
British firms in rcfusing to supply essential
data to Canadian firms. I have neyer been
able to get an answer as to whether or not
any such compiaint was made. 1 ventured
the opinion then that there never was any,
because there nover had been any misconduet
as allegýed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Could my right
honourable friend nlot wait for the answer?
Rigbit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know what
it is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the Senate
bas flot got the answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: The Senate
is entitled to an answer to its own motion,
and what I saw in my honourable frîend's
room was not an anser at ail.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right honourable friend prejudges the question when
he knows I have a statement to make to
the Senate this afternoon.
Meanwhile I
sbould like to attend Council and try to
obtain an answer to my right honourable
friend's first query.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FJNANCING AND GUAHANTEE BILL
THIRD READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDU1IAND rnoved the
third reading of Bill 98, an Act to authorize
the provision of moneys to meet certain
capital expenditures made and capital indebtedness incurrod by the Canadian National
Railways Systemn during the calendar year
1941, to provide for the refunding of financial obligations and to authorize the guarantee by His Mai esty of certain securities
to be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, when this
Bill was before us yesterday my right bonourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
requested certain inforrmation under twe
heads. First, he desired to have a detailed
statement covering paragraph (b) of section

going into the terminais at Montreal. I
told him that $17,000,000 had been spent
Up to 1931, when the work iras suspended.
When, in 1937 or 1938. the work was resumed,
Riglit Hon. MNr.MEIGHEN.

the Canadian National Raiiways carried it
on as a modifiod programme entaiing an.
expenditure of some $12,000,000. At the time
my right honourabie friend feared that that
$12,000,000 was but an estimate and that the
expenditure would run to a very much larger
amount. I think ho wviil be happy to find
that bis fears have not been reaiizedRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
-that
we
have remained witbin the $12,000,000 and ail
that is now needed is $2,000,000.
1 have undor my hand a short statement
togother with the figures. It reads as foilows:
The completion of the Montreai terminai
development of the Canadian National Railways
on the modified scale is fully justified. A
thorough examination of the situation bas
been made by the Standing Cominittee of the
House of Commons on Railways and Shipping
at its meetings. The work bas now progressed
to a point where, apart from commitinents
aiready made, the expenditure required to
complote the project is approximately $2,000,000.
The terminai will be opened next year.
Briefly, tbe situation is as follows:
Total expenditures an(l commitments as of May 1, 1941 .........

Thc.sc two amounts total 829,000,000 odd,
whichi includes the $17,000,000 expended up

I think that covers all the details asked for
by my right honourable friend with regard
to subsection (b) of section 2 of the Bill.
My right honourable friend bas asked also
for an explanation of clause 11, "Contribution to Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island
Railways Employees' Provident Fund." The
money paid to this fund used to be included
in the sum vofcd annually by Parliament to
cover deficits, and authority for payment was
given to the Canadian National Railways in
As there
express terms in the deficit vote
is no deficit vote this year, authority is given
by the Bill.
I draw the attention of my right honourable
friend to chapter 47 of the session of 1940,
where in vote No. 459, under the title of
"Deficits, Canadian National Railway Company," there is a statement giving authority
similar to that to be found in clause 11 of the
Bill before us. This statement reads:
Amount required to provide for the payment
during the fiscal year 1940-41 to the Canadian
National Railway company (hereinafter called
the National Company) upon applications
approved by the Minister of Transport, made
from time to time by the National Company,
to the Minister of Finance and to be applied
by the National Conpany in payment of the
deficit (certified by the auditors of the National
Company) arising in the calendar year 1940,
inciuding such supplementary contribution to
the Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island
Railways Employees' Provident Fund as may be
necessary to provide for payment in full of
monthly allowances under the provisions of the
Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island Railways Employees' Provident Fund Act, notwithstanding the limitation contained in section
four of the said Act, and including such supplementary contribution te the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada Superannuation and Provident
Fund as may be necessary to enable payment
to be made of monthly allowances under the
rules and regulations of the Fund, notwithstanding the limitation contained in section
thirteen of chapter sixty-five of the Statutes of
Canada, 1874.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I have before me a statement of the yearly
expenditures of the Canadian National Railways to provide for the deficit in the superannuation funds of the two companies, the
Intercolonial and the Grand Trunk.
Contribution of $100,000 to the Grand Trunk
Railway of Canada Superannuation and Provident Fund, included with C.N.R. deficit
appropriation.
This contribution was first granted in the
year 1936 and bas remained at the same figure
annually since that date.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
figure?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: $100,000 a year.
I thought I had a statement giving the yearly
expenditure under these two heads. It must
be on my table. For a number of years,
during the two regimes, probably from 1930
to 1935, there was an expenditure of a more
or less fixed amount from year to year in
That covers the
regard to these deficits.
Grand Trunk.
Two courses were apparently open for consideration; first, reduction in the scale of peusions to conforma with the new reduced value
of the fend, and, secondly, some method of
obtaining temporary assistance to carry on until
such time as property values had re-established
thernselves. The depressed conditions at rte
time were considered to be of a temporary
nature and the railway company was therefoie
approached for assistance in order to maintain
the fund.
On January 21, 1936, at a meeting of the
railway trustees, a minute was passed granting
such assistance, teniporarily, with the proviso
that any residue of funds remaining after the
termination of the last pension would accrue to
the railway company, and a further proviso
that control of tie association would also be
turned over to the raiiway. Tiese conditions
have been duly carried out by the association.
The depression of property values still exists
and, for the meantime, the Government is
obliged to continue affording aid to this fund.
Copy of minute of C.N.R. trustees of January
21, 1936, attached.
As to the Canadian National Railway
Company I have a copy of a minute of the
trustee of the National Railways of January 21, 1936. It says:
The position of the Grand Trunk Railway of
Canada Superannuation and Provident Fund
Association was again discussed and the chairman informed the meeting of the correspondence he had had with the Minister of Railways
on the subject.

It was decided that the committee of management of the association be informed, in ansver
te its letter te the President dated December
13 last, that the company will include an item
in its Financing Bill for 1936 se as te authorize
the company to assist the fund with cash aid
to meet the immediate requirements of the fund
in an amount to be determined by the company, on the understanding that the association
shall clarify its rules te make it clear that any
residue of funds remaining after the termina-

JUNE 12, 1941
tion of the last pension shall accrue to the
company, and to provide that members of the
committee of management nominated by the
company shall constitute a majority of the
committee.
It was further decided that the amount to
be included in the Financing Bill, as aforesaid,
be determined by the chairman.
I wish I had under my hand the statement
of payments made annually for a number of
years. - If I bring it ta the House this afternoon in order to show what the expenditure
under these two heads has been, my right honourable friend will perhaps be satisfied with
this explanation.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I cannot even put on an appearance of much

satisfaction.
I shall deal first with the last matter discussed. Apparently ever since 1936, that year
included, the Canadian National Railways has
placed in its estimates a figure of $100,000 to

supplement the pension fund for the old
Grand Trunk officials and employees, and
this amount bas been voted by Parliament.

Of course this House would have virtually no

say about it at all, because the vote came
to us in the form of a money bill. But this
year, to avoid anything in the nature of a
vote, a clause providing for the payment of
whatever deficit there may be in respect of
this fund is quietly inserted in a Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is no deficit vote.

Because there

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Because the
items, if put in, would have to appear in a
deficit vote. It -does not very much matter
whether it is done by an estimate or otherwise, except that when it is done by an
estimate we know the amount and it appears
in our record, whereas now it does not.
There is no information to show either that
this vote is justified or that it is not. It may
be justified. I do not know. We in this
House have certainly treated that railway
company with generosity, and it never has
had cause to complain of the people of Canada, though it bas, through some of its officials,
made most unworthy and ignoble claims and
complaints. If the company has established
a fund to which we are making contributions
on a certain basis, Parliament is, I think, entitled to know why that fund cannot stand on
its own feet. "To supplement the fund" is a
very fine phrase, but is this really a grant of
$100,000 a year to these former Grand Trunk
officials?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If the Grand
Trunk was obligated to supplement that fund,
we are obligated.

255

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: True. We
have taken over the company's obligations.
But the honourable leader will sec that the
vote, commencing with 1936, and the terms of
this Bill, provide that payment may be made
notwithstanding the limitation contained in
an Act of Parliament. This, to my mind, indicates that we are not obligated at all; indeed,
that we have to set aside a law in order to
make payment. If we are setting aside a law
in order to pay, why not go to the rescue of
all other pension funds in Canada? If there
is obligation I shall be the last to complain,
no matter how difficult our situation; but
we have nothing before us to show that there
is, or ever was. The indications, though not
conclusive, are that this is just a grant to a
certain section of our people, and, I should
think it probable, to many who are not our
people at all.
As regards the Prince Edward Island affair,
the amount is probably very much smaller,
and it is likely that those who get the benefit
would be in Canada. Objection to this would
not apply with the same force as in respect of
the Grand Trunk item.
Certainly there is no information at all
before the House to show why we have saine
special obligation to a certain pension fund
when we apparently have no legal obligation.
We do not assume a special obligation to any
other pension funds or towards many people
who have worked just as long as these have.
Hon. Mr. EULER: How long bas that
been paid?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Since 1936.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There were payments anterior to that. I did not know my
right honourable friend wanted to go into the
merits of the payment, inasmuch as the
expenditure is a regular one that we have
been making from year to year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There were
payments anterior to 1936? That was not
the information in the statement read by tbe
honourable leader. It said payment commenced in 1936.
As respects the Canadian National's terminal
in Montreal, not much need be said. I do
not think the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) should be quite so sure that
the expenditures are within the $12,000,000
estimate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. The
expenditures are far beyond this, even on my
honourable friend's own

figures.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable members, I promised to submit a statement of contributions to cover deficits in
superannuation funds. I intimated that the
old Grand Trunk Railway of Canada's superannuation and provident fund was receiving
$100,000 a year, and that on the demise of
the last pensioner whatever remained in the
fund would revert to the State.
As to contributions to offset deficits in the
Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island Railways Employees' Provident Fund, I am somewhat hesitant to indicate the extent of our
contributions. I do not know how long we
shall have to carry the load, but it has been
a very heavy one. In this connection I desire
to place on Hansard the following statement:

As honourable members will notice, the

mortality tables, we may expect a decrease.
Since 1925 our contributions to the fund have
reached a total of more than $13,000,000. No

that during his term of office contributions
to the provident fund continued to increase.

14879-17
REVISED
EDITION

258

SENATE

The decision not to permit women ta go
overseas, except in special cases, was taken on
June 4, 1940, and is.incorporated in an Order
in Council of that date, P. C. 2371. The order
provides that women, other than women
engaged or employed in the Armed Forces or
the Public Service of Canada, and children
under the age of twelve years, are prohibited
rrom travelling to countries in the European
var zone. The Secretary of State for External
A.ffairs is authorized, however, to grant exempion in special cases involving hardship.
The Order in Council, it may be noted, was
based on the very similar Order in Couneil of
February 20, 1917, passed when the difficulties
and dangers of travel across the Atlantic and
the growing problem of food supplies in Great
Britain made it advisable to put a stop to the
movement of women and children ta Britain.
The present Order in Council was passed at
the instance of the Canadian military authorities and on representations from the Canadian High Commissioner in London. It was
passed at a time when the occupation of the
Low Countries and Northern France by the
enemy greatly increased the strain on shipping,
the danger of travel in the Atlantic, and the
problem of food supplies and housing accommodation in Great Britain itself. There was
also another consideration, and that a very
important one, namely, the desire to avoid the
situation which arose at the close of the last
war when the presence in the United Kingdom
of considerable numbers of Canadian women
who had gone to lie with their husbands there
seriously delayed the repatriation of Canadian
troops. I may add that the situation as regards
shipping, food supplies and housing accoinmodation is at least as serious now as when it
was deemed necessary to pass the present
Order in Council, nearly a year ago.
Provision is made, as I have already indicated,
for exemption in special cases where hardship
is involved. Under this provision permits have
been granted to two or three categories ot
women and children, such as those passing in
transit through Canada from Australia or the
Far East, women whose homes are in the United
Kingdom and who have been in Canada on a
brief visit, or who are without financial resources
in this country. A number of permits have
also been granted, at the request of the United
Kingdoin Government, to women who are proceeding overseas to marry British subjects
domiciled in the United Kingdom and who would
not be returning to Canada. Permits have also
been granted to eight occupational therapists
whose services were requested by the British
War Office and the Department of Health for
Seotland and for whom definite arrangements
for employment were made in advance.
I may add that there have been a great many
requests which it has not been found practicable
to grant under the Order in Council, from
women of all ages who desire to go to the United
Kingdon to take part in war activities of
Indeed, practically all the

requests for special exemption from women who

of them, indeed, have stated that they had offers

serve, usually intimate that their services would
be welcomed, but that they are invitations to
present themselves for enrolment rather than
definite assurances of employment.
Perhaps the largest group of women desiring
to volunteer their services is that of motor
drivers, of which there are, of course, many
different categories.
The United Kingdom
authorities, who were approached on the matter,
took the view, however, that it would be preferable for women to join the Women's Auxiliary
Territorial Service of the British Army or the
sister organizations which serve the Royal
Navy, or the Royal Air Force. They indicated,
however, it would be undesirable to allow
women to proceed to the United Kingdom without being definitely accepted for service before
departure because of the strict medical examination required, and there have been no proposals from the United Kingdom Government
to recruit women for these services in Canada.
The desire of large numbers of Canadian
wemen to do war work in the United Kingdom
is recognized and appreciated by the Government. The prospect of danger or privation has
in no wise deterred them from offering their
services, but rather tended to stimulate them
to offer to undertake any work for which there
might be a need. It would surely be unwise,
however, especially at this critical period in the
war, to permit an added drain on shipping and
housing and food resources to develop when
there is no real assurance that the women would
be accepted for service on arrival. Even in
such cases it would not be an efficient employment of our war resources for Canadian women
to be taken across the ocean to do work for
whiich there are already women available in
the United Kingdom. I should add that if the
British Government wished to secure the services of competent Canadian women for war
work, to meet any shortage that miglit develop,
the Canadian Government would, of course, be
quite prepared to give the matter immediate
and most careful consideration.
That is the statement which I could have,
and perhaps should have, brought to the
Senate earlier, in reply to the inquiry of my
right honourable friend. As I have already
explained, I delayed doing so because I
thought a fair summary of this statement was
contained in the department's letter.
Now I come to the question raised by my
right honourable friend with reference to a
newspaper dispatch coming from-I do not
remember whether it was from the United
States or Great Britain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was
Canadian Press dispatch from Ottawa.

a

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was very much
interested in the question, and most desirous
of learning whether British authorities had
approached the Canadian Government to see
if we could render assistance to the British
airmen who are coming to the United States
to the number, I think, of about 8,000, for a
short course of training. I have been informed
by the Department of External Affairs that
there has been no such request or inquiry,
and no communication on the subject. So

JUNE 12, 1941
whatever bas passed concerning the reception
of those airmen and their feminine helpers
in the United States bas passed between the
British Government and the Government of
the United States, or British Government
representatives in that country.
Nothing
whatever bas indicated. that our help would
be accepted or even desirable; otherwise the
Government would instantly have examined
in;to the situation.
I come now te the Order passed by the
Senate on April 3
for a copy of all representations, letters, documents, telegrams or other communications passing, prior to the evacuation of Dunkirk, from
the Canadian Government to the British Government, with respect in any way to the refusal,
reluctance or delay of British firms to supply
necessary plans, specifications or other essential
data to Canadian firms, to be used in the production of war equipment or munitions of any kind.
I have a brief statement which I should like
te lay before the House. My previous statemente were based upon those made in the
other House by the Minister of Munitions
and Supply on various occasions, and more
especially on May 22, 1940, when lie said:
The department is, in fact, the salesman for
Canadian war materiais to the governments of
our allies, and is and has been doing its best
to put forward Canada's potential productive
capacity in a form that will attract orders.
It must be remembered that Canada's army
in Britain and France, although commanded by
Canadians, forms part of the British army, and
has no separate lines of communication. Therefore, it is practically a necessity that our
equipment be interchangeable with British
equi.pment. This means that the armament of
our troops must largely be built to British
standards, and that British desigus must be
followed. One of our chief difficulties has been
to obtain the latest British designs for mechanical equipment used by our troops in conmon operations. British industry has not been
too willing te part with these designs, many of
which represent years of study and development by private manufacturing firms.
In the last war, Canada's chief production
was shell cases. We are now tooled up to
produce this type of equipment far in excess
of our own needs, but to date British orders
have not been forthcoming in a quantity
proportional te our industrial capacity.
This bas been disappointing to our manufacturers, who have been building on the precedent of the last war. I can only say that
this war bears little resemblance te the last
one in the nature of the requirements from
Canada. The fact that te date Britain and
France have been satisfied te rely largely on
their own production and mechanicaI equipment
and have net been disposed te encourage Canadian production of heavy equipment to the
extent of furnishing up-to-date plans and
specifications, has undoubtedly prevented Canadian industry from playing its full part in
mechanical warfare. I am happy te say that
there are now indications that this will net
continue.
That was on May 22, 1940.

Honourable senators will recall that a
British Purchasing Mission arrived in Ottawa
at the time war broke out, and that it was
afterwards enlarged and transformed into the
British Supply Board. The Canadian Defence
Purchasing Board, subsequently the War
Supply Boardi, and finally, after April 9, 1940,
the Department of Munitions and Supply,
acted as purchasing agent for the British
Supply Board in Canada. Throughout the
greater part of the period Mr. Howe was the
responsible Minister, and his statement of
May 22, 1940, was based on the experience
of the boards, and later of the department
for which lie was responsible, in their relations
with the British Purchasing Missions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is my
honourable friend reading from now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is my statement of the relations between the British
authorities and British industries on the one
hand and Canada on the other, through these
Purchasing Missions.
The Prime Minister's telegram of June 8,
1940, to our High Commissioner, Mr. Massey,
which I read to the Senate on April 3 last,
covered the same ground. The Prime Minister
then alluded te a cablegram which lie had
sent to the Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom, Right Hon. Mr. Churchill, te the
same effect.
As honourable senators are aware, the Government does net consider that, as a matter of
practice, it is desirable in the public interest
te make available communications passing
between the governments of Canada and the
United Kingdom, except when such communications are specifically intended for publication. For obvious reasons adherence to
this general practice is considered particularly
desirable in the case of communications relating te war production.
I have before me Mr. King's cablegram te
Mr. Churchill of May 18, 1940-that was
before Dunkirk-and Mr. Churchill's answer
of June 1. I have already given my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
in his capacity as a member of the Privy
Council, access te these confidential communications, and they are at his disposal. I have
before me copies of the cabIegrams which I
passed on te him for perusal.
My right honourable friend said this morning that he had net received a precise answer
to his inquiry as to what had passed between
the governments concerning the negligence or
the refusal of British industries in regard te
furnishing plans and specifications. I emphasized the fact that these matters had te be
dealt with by our purchasing office, our Supply

Board, and the Minister

of Munitions and

Supp]y. The Minister liad been in contact
with representatives of the British Government who were here to make purchases.
Through Lis communications with themn he had
a knowledge of the stand they were taking, and
hie was in a position to make that statement
of May 22, 1940. It was clearIy substantiated

passed throughi Canada and come into contact
with the Canadian industries.
I think I have made out a case which shows
clearly that the Canadian Government was
flot complacent and that even if it appeared
so, that was hencnxse it had to await the
action of the British Government and British
industries. who were dilatory in furnishing
the Canadian Government with orders. This
stand on the part of the British was, as 1
have said before, quite ünderstandabie. They
wanted to, produce as mauch as possible of
their requirements in order to keep their own
industries husy and maintain credits abroad,
especially in Canada, wlîerc they were assuming large responsibilities in the matter of purchasing. 1 think my right honourable friend
will understand the position of Mr. Howc,
because this statement, which comes from Mr.
Howe's department, and frein himself, explains
the situation fromn the time hie met the representatives of the British Goverroment and was
in daily communication with. their Purchasrng Missions bore conccrning the very slowness
with which orders werc coming from the
,other side.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Well,
my honourable friend has covcred a lot of
ground. I shall try to make my comments
coincide with the arrangement lie has adopted.
My honourable friend referred first, I thinkç,
to the Order in Council of June 4, 1940.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
other matter.

That is on the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. And ho
read a letter which was written to me by the
department.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, not a letter.
I read -a statement covering what was written
to my right honourable friend.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is the same
as the letter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That may Le
so, but I thought the letter was more
concise.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was almost
word for word in accordance with the statement. I gave a synopsis of that letter this
morirg.
It was quite unnecessary to cover the whole
ground. Thom is only one question in issue,
and it is very clear: whether it was wise to
restrain the movement of women to the
battie area in Britain. 0f course it was wise,
both in the last war and in this. It had to be
done. That the restriction should apply to
the wives of mon in the army is clear, for they
cannot render sufficient service to .iustify the
risk involved in going to England, and the
consoquent consumption of food and clothing
there.
I have urged that exception be made, by
reasonable regulation, for but one class of
persons: those acceptod-and tbey are acepted
onýly if possessing special qualifications-for
auxiliary war services in England. This class

Applicant-s are accepted subj oct to medical
examination in England, and I suggested that

intervene to sec if the examination could not
be made bore.
The relevancy of the movement of British
womeon to the United States is most plain.
Great Britain Las fnîmnd it necessary to send
trained women across the ocean to this side.
That indicates it might have been wîse for uýs
to develop some form of auxiliary service
here. We have done nothing of the kind.
I do not think the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) intended to convey the
impression that C'anada would not wake up
to the need for developing any war service
at ahl unless a suggestion wcre received from.
the British Govcrnment. V/e are just as much
interested in the resuit of this war as Great

Canada? So far as we know, it has not.

JUNE 12, 1941
The second matter dealt with by the honourable leader was the long list of payments
to deficient pension funds of the Grand Trunk
Railway and the Intercolonial and Prince
Edward Island Railways. I was amazed to
find that the second mentioned fund is of
such tremendous magnitude.
So was I.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We have not
been given the reason why, notwithstanding
the provisions of a statute, a contribution is
to be made. As contributions have been
made over a long period, there presumably
must be a good reason. The lesson the Government ought to learn from this is that
dependence cannot be placed on statistical
calculations based upon the unknown. Such
calculations are being relied upon for purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Act, in
respect of which I foresee huge deficits. The
Prime Minister of Great Britain said, in
relation to another matter-but his words are
far more applicable here-that by an immutable law of nature these preliminary calculations upon which expenditures are
foreshadowed and based are always far too
low. He gave an instance where a project
that was estimated to cost $300,000 had, when
only half completed, cost $1,500,000. In a
country such as this we are going to be faced
with much the same sort of calamity in
respect of these unemployment insurance
calculations. I do wish the Government, by
dilly-dallying or any other method, could
postpone the assumption of this terrific load
until we are able to see some daylight through
the fearful circumstances of the present time.
The third and most important subject dealt
with by the honourable leader had to do with
my inquiry as to whether or not representations were made to the British Government
in respect of the conduct of certain British
industrialists. The honourable leader read
again a speech by Mr. Howe, and-a thing
he does not often do-he read his own speech
again.
I commented
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
upon it.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I remember
both speeches quite well. I hope I may not
be thought disrespectful if I decline to accept
Mr. Howe's assurance as to a matter which
undoubtedly casts a serious reflection on
British industry. It is possible for him to
make mistakes. I am reminded at the moment
of an article I read in an Alberta paper,
referring to him at a time when many of his
forecasts had proved unsound and he had
decided to make no more. All the article said
was this: "Mr. Howe is very wise in his

declaration that after this he will not try to
foretell events. Mr. Howe cannot foretell
events accurately even after they have taken
place."
The fact which I have tried to drive home
repeatedly, but which is never referred to
in any reply, is this. Canada has undoubtedly
understood from the beginning of this war,
and should have understood long before, that
preparation in the way of manufacture of
munitions and arms had to be made and that,
notwithstanding any exchange situation existing at the beginning of the war or any which
was likely to occur, we ought to manufacture
here to the extent at least of our own needs.
Of course, these munitions and arms of
various kinds would have to correspond with
the British types. It was our duty to engage
in that manufacture with the utmost speed
and on the largest possible scale, to the
extentHon. Mr. DUFFUS: When?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What does
that interruption mean? I was saying that
it was our duty to produce these munitions to the extent at least of our own requirements. My question was: Why was this not
done? Mr. Howe replied that British industry was reluctant to supply the plans to
Canadian firms. That is a very serious
indictment of British industry. At the commencement of a great war in which we were
participants, any reluctance or delay, or, to
use the honoumble leader's word, dilatoriness such as 'has been alleged, would be
discreditable to British industry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But up to that
time the British industries thought they could
carry on the work themselves.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Suppose that
is true-I am neither disputing nor supporting
it-what difference does it make? What I
have tried to drive home is this, that no
matter what British firms thought, we had
the right to provide for our own needs. If
they were dilatory in furnishing us with the
necessary plans, they were guilty of an
offence against their own nation and against
liberty-an offence for which they could
never forgive themselves. That is what they
are charged with by Mr. Howe.
I contended in this House when I brought
the matter up before, and I contend again now,
that if Mr. Howe or any other member of the
Government thought his charge was true,
representations should have been made at
once to the British Government, which alone
could call those industries to account, which
alone could make them toe the line and do

their duty. Therefore I asked in Parliament
whether any representations had been made
as to this alleged misconduct of British industrial leaders. To this hour I have received no
answer. All the talk we have had this afternoon provides none whatever. Then I moved
that communications passing from the Canadian Governmcnt to the British Government
with respect to this alleged attitude on the
part of British firms should be produced. The
But so far
Senate passed that motion.
nothing whatever has been produced. I hope
the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was not trying to
have the House understand that the letter
he showed me, from the Prime Minister to
the British Government, made a complaint.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A representation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know any reason in the world why it should
not be disclosed. It was a proper letter, but
it made no complaint at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But what was
he asking? He referred to that in his speech,
which was cited.

I quite agree it is only right and proper
that any communication passing from the
British Government to this Government
should not be made publie without the
British Government's approval. I never have
asked for the disclosure of any such communication. But does that rule apply to a
communication passing from the Canadian
Government to the British Government? Is
not our Government the judge as to whether
such a communication may be disclosed?
Neville Chamberlain went to Munich and
made an arrangement. Immediately the Canadian Government sent a cablegram of congratulations to the British Government. Am
I to understand that approval was received
from the British Government before that
cablegram was made public?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ent kind of communication.

That is a differ-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perfect nonsense!
It is for the Canadian Government
to decide whether any communication from it
to the British Government is to be published
or not. There can be no hiding behind any
injunction of the British Government.

Whose

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I differ with my
right honourable friend in toto.

The Prime
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Minister alluded to the cablegram he had sent
to Mr. Churchill.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the Canadian Government will not publish or disclose
to us any communication that it ever sends,
then it should stop intimating that this, that
and the other thing, which can only be
checked by reference to communications, has
taken place. I say to the honourable leader:
If you will not show us what you sent, at
least tell us whether or not you sent any
communication of the kind I described. But
you will not tell us. You will not tell us this
afternoon though you talk till six o'clock.
You will never tell us whether you sent any
communication complaining of the conduct of
British industry. No wonder I said that in
my judgment, based only on the circumstances
revealed before everyone here, there never was
any communication of the kind referred to.
If what Mr. Howe said was right, a complaint should have been sent to the British
Government. If his statement was wrong,
it never should have been made.

Right
speech?

Hon.

Mr.

MEIGHEN:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I saw the
letter. I will never give it to the House, but
I see no reason why the ionourable leader
cannot disclose it. I do not want honourable
members to get the impression that that
letter was a representation such as I say
should have been made, if what Mr. Howe
charged was true. It was nothing of the kind.
There was nothing in it about British firms
refusing to supply plans, or holding back
plans, in order to get the business themselves.
As I say, my motion was passed, but no
communication is produced. I asked a question: most of the session has gone by and I
am still without an answer. Instead I am told
there is a rule under which communications
with the British Government cannot be disclosed, unless that Government gives its
approval, except in cases where a communication is evidently intended to be made public.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These two letters
are marked "secret and confidential."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be.
But do not intimate to the House that they
are of the nature of a complaint to the
British Government. They are nothing of the
sort.
Right

Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend will realize that a communication marked "confidential," sent by the
British Government to the Canadian Government, or by the Canadian Government to the
British Government, cannot be published
unless the communication in reply is also
published.
If there is a request for the
publication of one side of a discussion, we

may say: "You have asked for a copy of our
letter or cable to the Prime Minister of Great

discloses our position, not the position of
the Prime Minister of Great Britain, whose
answer might be quite satisfactory. I think
it would be unfair and unjustifiable to publish
a cablegram or letter addressed confidentially
to another Government without first obtaining its permission to do so.

when our work will end. It can end only
when the Supply Bill reaches us. I understand that that is the only business now
before the House of Commons, but, as honourable senators are aware, certain items may
provoke lengthy and unexpected discussion.
So I have no alternative to moving adjournment of the Senate until 3 o'clock to-morrow

better position to judge when the Supply Bill
will reach this House.

WITHHOLDING OF EXEATS
DISCUSSION CONCLUDED

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I read a statement yesterday
in answer to an inquiry of my right honourable friend concerning the question of exeats
for Canadian women who would like to serve
in Great Britain. At the conclusion of my
remarks on the Order in Council prohibiting
women and children from travelling to the
United Kingdom except by special permission,
I pointed out that if His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom should wish to
secure the services of competent Canadian
women for any particular branch of war work,
to meet any shortage that might develop,
immediate attention would be given to the
question of providing exit permits.

263

I am now informed that in the past week
or two further information has been received
respecting the need for a number of qualified
women transport drivers. It has been decided,
in principle, to relax the regulations somewhat to permit them to proceed overseas.
Consideration is now being given to the
detailed requirements it will be neeessary
to fulfil before women can be accepted for
enrolment in United Kingdom motor transport organizations. An essential condition
will be that they must be accepted for service
by representatives of a United Kingdom
organization or corps before leaving this
country. The reason for this requirement, as
the British authorities have pointed out, is
that both technical and medical qualifications
are high, and it would bu a waste of effort
for women to go to the United Kingdom
only to find on arriving there that they were
unable to measure up to the standards
required. A further point is that applicants,
if accepted, would have to give an undertaking
to serve for the duration of the war, or as
long as their services were required, since
there is already a beavy pressure on shipping
by reason of the desire of Canadian women
in the United Kingdom to return to Canada.
I should perhaps add that if, in the months
to come, there should be any indication from
the British authorities of an urgent need for
the services of qualified women in other
branches of war work, consideration will be
given to granting special exemption for them
also.
I think this will satisfy my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Completely.
I have nothing more to ask, nor did I ask
more.
Honourable
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON:
senators, may I say a word on this subject?
I have received a number of requests from
women of British birth who are eager to
return to England. Most of them are qualified
nurses who have letters from various hospitals
and midwives' associations in the Old Country
promising them work immediately upon their
return. This week I had one request from a
nurse and midwife. For several months these
people have been wanting to go, but so far no
consideration has been given to their applications. They have been long enough in Canada
to have lost the right to return to Britain.
They al are eager to serve, and, as far as I
am able to judge, the British authorities are
desirous of having them over there, where
the need for people with such qualifications
is greater, I should imagine, than that for
transport drivers and people of that kind. I

have one letter from an occupational therapeutist, who is also a nurse and stenographer.
She has been looking after a hostel for British
children in Montreal, and ever since January
has been seeking an opportunity to return to
England. This woman has several letters from
England stating that her services could be
used over there, but so far she has been
unable to obtain permission to go.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I shall draw
my honourable friend's remarks to the attention of the Department of External Affairs.
I suggest that she write the department and
send it a detailed statement.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON:

THE WAR SITUATION AND CANADA'S
WAR EFFORT
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
I was
informed at noon that the Prime Minister
had given ta the other House this morning
a review of recent war developments and of
Canada's war effort. I think we are entitled
to have the Prime Minister's words placed
on our own Hansard for future reference. The
statement is a fairly long one. I will read
only the first paragraph, to give honourable
members a clear indication of the subjectmatter.
Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING: Mr.
Speaker, the honourable member for RosetownBiggar (Mr. Coldwell) on Wednesday last
expressed the hope that before Parliament
adjourned for the summer months I might find
it possible ta make a brief statement with
respect ta recent developments in the war
situation and our own war effort. He expressed
the view that such a statement might serve to
strengthen the morale of the country, which, as
he rightly believes, is apt to suffer when faced
with severe reverses or seeming reverses such
as those which have recently taken place in the
Middle East. I have no hesitation whatever
in saying that a truc perspective of the situation should go a long way toward strengthening
the national morale.
With the consent of the House I should like
ta make that statement at once, as in all
probability either to-day or to-morrow will be
the last occasion on which there will be an
opportunity to make~ it.
Whether it is better to fight and lose, or not
to fight at all, is one of the oldest questions
facing military strategists confronted with an
enemy of superior strength. Reverses there are
bound ta be, and we must not lose heart when
they come.
When we recall that, up till a year ago,
Britain placed her main reliance on the French
forces in Syria and North Africa and on the
French fleet in the Mediterranean for the
protection of the common allied interests in the
whole Mediterranean basin, and then reflect
that a year has passed since the collapse of
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON.

France and no vital British position has yet
been lost, it should give us cause, not for
satisfaction
certainly, but, at least, for
thankfulness.
In an attempt to capture the changing phases
of a world-wide war, it is obvious that the
picture, if relieved by sunshine, must also be
darkened by shadow. To-day there may be an
encircling gloom-to-morrow there will be
shafts of light.
I can but reiterate what I have previously
said to this House and the people of Canada.
We shall only be helping the enemy and not
ourselves if we are unduly elated by temporary
success, or if we are unduly downcast by
temporary failure.
No thoughtful man could ever have believed
that this war would be over in a few months,
or won by a short, sharp thrust. From the
very beginning it was obvious that the volcanie
forces let loose in the world were so mighty
that a long, grim struggle was inevitable.. It
was bound ta spread from nation ta nation,
from ocean ta ocean, and from continent to
continent.
The weak, the unprotected, and the perversely
neutral were obliged ta fall by the wayside.
The final conflict was inevitably destined to
be waged between the strong.
To-day, in what may be the bitterest chapter
of the battle for freedom, state discipline fights
self discipline. The strongest men ever forged
and hammered by a state meet on many fronts
the strongest men ever tempered by the fires of
liberty.
In this last ciapter a few indubitable facts
stand out in bold relief. The war will be won
or lost, not in Africa or in Asia or in the

islands of the Pacifie, but in the wide waters
of the Atlantic, on the shores and in the skies
of Britain. The Mediterranean is but an outskirt of the city of liberty. The battlements
are in the Atlantic and the English channel.
Freedom fails only if Britain falls.
Let me for a moment seek ta balance our
advantages and our disadvantages in the air, on
the land and at sea.
In the air, the balance of machine power is
gradually being adjusted.
Increasing numbers
of Nazi bombers are being destroyed at niglt;
British raids on German objectives have not
only grown more effective, but no longer can
the official silence of the usually over-loquacious
German propaganda ministry bide their results
from the German people.
In his Reichstag speech on May 4, Hitler was
foreed 'to promise still better weapons for next
year. This statement was the first indication
given ta the German people that the war would
not, as hitherto forecast by Hitler, be ended
this year.
Thus are the prophecies of the
violent put ta confusion by free men.
The stream of machines continues to flow.
If any further evidence were needed of the
growth of the British and allied air power it
is to be found in aggressive activity in the
Atlantic ocean, in the North Sea ad
in the
Mediterranean. It is to be found, too, in the
steady defensive activity that every day pursues
its revenges against those who scatter indiscriminate murder and destruction upon British
soil from the British air.
Everywhere in sky warfare a situation not
yet mastered nevertheless improves from day
ta day.

JUNE 13, 1941

On the sea the curve of loss has recently
shown a decline. The shipping losses for May
were considerably dower than they were for
April. The attack of the Bismarck upon H.M.S.
Hood was followed by relentless pursuit and
swift retribution. The reality of British sea
power remains. The catalogue of the heavy
losses sustained by enemy shipping proves that,
if regard is paid to the comparative available
resources of tonnage, targets and striking power,
the balance of effective destruction is not tilted
as heavily as might appear upon the side of
Germany and Italy.

Mr. Roosevelt did not minimize the serionsness of the battle of the Atlantic. His statement that British shipping losses far exceeded
the present combined shipbuilding capacity of
Britain and the United States marks a
thoroughly realistic facing of the facts.
This continent is rapidly becoming not only
the arsenal of democracy, but the shipyard of

against destruction. Every ship added to the
Canadian Navy helps to relieve the tremendous
burden so gallantly borne by the British Navy.
Every new American warship, every new Canadian warship, helps the British Navy to detect
and to destroy. Every new merchant ship is a
guarantee of men, machines, munitions and
food.
In connection with land operations, there is
nothing which can be added to the closing
remarks of Mr. Churchill, made in his speech
on Wednesday, June 1l. If we eliminate the
occupation of the Channel islands by German
forces, at this time of speaking, after nearly
two years of war, no enemy soldier has a foot
on British soil. As Mr. Churchill said:
"If anybody had said in June last, we should
to-day hold every yard of the territories for
which Great Britain is responsible in the
Middle East, that we should have conquered
the whole Italian empire, that Egypt, Palestine
and Iraq would have been successfully defended
who said that would have been

thought a foolish visionary. Yet that is the
at the moment".
position
Those briefly are the salient, they are the
outstanding facts about tangible things.
As far as Canada is concerned, our own war
effort in men and materials has steadily gained
in momentum, in volume and in power. We
are adding everv day to the material and
strength of the allied cause. Every month sees
more Canadian troops, more Canadian sailors
and more Canadian airmen added to the
number of the defenders of Britain.

265

For some time past we have had an army
corps of two divisions in the British Isles. As
the Corps Commander, General McNaughton,
bas pointed out, they are helping to garrison
the one vital citadel, the retention of which
decides the war. We have made known to all
the world that our forces overseas are ready
to go, and that we are equally ready to have
them go wherever their services may count for
most. We are dispatching to Britain two
additional divisions, one a third infantry
division, the other an armoured division, also
a tank brigade and many reinforcements. All
will have been dispatched in the course of the
present year. This is apart altogether from
the forces we are retaining in Canada.
Ships of Canada's Navy have, as all honourable members are aware, been engaged with
British ships in the coastal waters of Britain.
They are now taking an increasingly important
part in the defence of the Atlantic coast and
in the duties of convoy on the great passageway of the Atlantic, so vital, not only to the
present of Britain, but also to the future of
Canada and of the United States of America.
Canadian airmen and Canadian squadrons,
as all are aware, have from the beginning been
taking their part in the battle of Britain. In
the Royal Canadian Air Force we have to-day

increased by graduates from the British
Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The Training Plan this year will double the number of
its enlistments. In Canada over fifty training
schools, twenty manning depots and twenty
recruiting centres are already in full operation.
From this source is flowing to Britain an evergrowing stream of pilots, observers and gunners.
They have crossed to Britain in thousands and
will continue to cross in ever-increasing
numbers.
We have recently sent from Canada to
Britain one thousand radio technicians whose
help bas been invaluable and will be invaluable
in the cleansing of the midnight air. More
are following on.
We are making machines for Britain's armed
forces as well as for our own. Canadian motor
transport vehicles, machine guns, aircraft,
corvettes, mine-sweepers, as well as shells,
explosives and chemicals, are being sent in
growing volume across the Atlantic. We are
sending and will continue to send to Britain
al] the goods which ships can be found ta
carry. But we are not stopping there. We
recognize the tremendous financial burden
which the British peoples are bearing. That
burden, as well, we are continuing to share in
ever-increasing measure.
Without complaint our people are bearing
the heaviest taxes in their history. In addition
they are loaning their savings to the Government. I know that with loyal willingness they
will lend and, if necessary, give, whatever is
needed to strengthen and supplement the financial resources of the Government of this
country. The Canadian people are performing
a magnificent task. They will not fail the
cause to which we have pledged our all. They
are producing, and will produce to the limits
of their strength and genius, the material,
tangible things, without whieh victory cannot
be won.
There remain, alsa, as our sure strength and
shield, the intangible things of the human
spirit. The will to live, and to endure every
hardship that all may continue to enjoy the

blessings of freedom, is a part of Canadian
character. We in Canada have a veritable
passion for human brotherhood; a hatred of
hate; an intolerance of intolerance. Ours is
the unshaken and unshakeable purpose to
re-establish upon the earth, now hideous with
the blackened ruins of civilization, a freedom
wider and more deeply founded in social and
international justice than ever before in human
history. All these intangible things are the
very fibre and fabric of the national character
alike of the British and Canadian peoples.
Tried by many onslaughts, tested by many
defeats, the inner fortresses of that character
remain unbroken and unbreakable, impregnable,
indomitable. Against their walls, the tides of
tyranny and the waves of battle will beat in

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I now move that when the Senate
adjourns this evening it stand adjourned until
to-morrow morning at 11 o'clock. As honourable members are aware, the Commons are
still discussing Supply, which will be the last
measure to reach us. It is hoped that they
will have completed their work before
midnight.
The motion was agreed to.
SEPARATION
ALLOWANCES
SOLDIERS' CHILDREN

FOR

DISCUSSION

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. L. COTE: Before the Senate adjourns,
may I take this opportunity of directing the
attention of honourable members to a matter
in connection with recruiting for overseas
service.
The honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) bas just placed on Hansard
a statement by the Prime Minister with
respect to our war effort. The other day,
reading the conditions of enlistment for overseas service and the terms of pay and allowances to enlisted soldiers, I noticed that if a
man enlists, in addition to his pay there is a
separation allowance for his wife, and also
for his children. As I recollect, the allowance
for each child is $12; but it is limited to
two children only.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
thought.

That is what I

Hon. Mr. COTE: I remember that that
regulation was announced a short time after
war was declared, and a few days ago I read
that it had been retained. I do not remember
seeing any valid reason given for the regulation. I do not know whether the person who
drafted the regulation, and induced the Government to accept it, had in-mind the purpose
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of discouraging enlistment for service overseas
of men with more than two children, but if
that was his purpose such a regulation, I am
sure, would not achieve it. Whoever conceived the regulation has, I think, a rather
poor knowledge of the human soul. When a
man feels it is his sacred duty to answer the
call of his country, to go overseas and risk his
life to defend the cause for which we are
fighting, the fact that only two of his three
or four children will receive an allowance will
not stop him from enlisting. As a matter of
fact, although I have not the figures, I happen
to know that many soldiers with more than
two children have enlisted for overseas service.
If the purpose of the limitation was entirely
one of economy, my answer is, "Yes, you will
effect an economy, but at the expense of
,whom? At the expense of the other children."
The soldier-father of, say, four children who
goes overseas will be fed and clothed the same
as other soldiers, but he will feel that an
ungrateful country is asking his four children
to live on the allowances for two.
I wish to register my protest against this
discrimination. It is not very long ago that
we heard in this very Chamber the division
bells ringing to summon honourable members
to vote on a motion to refuse concurrence in
an amendment to the Pension Bill which had
been adopted by the Committee on Banking
and Commerce. This amendment would have
deprived a trainee, a young man who is given
free training in the handling of arms, but who
may never enlist for service overseas, of a
pension for injuries not connected with his
service. The leader of the House moved that
in that particular the report of the committee
be rejected, and it was rejected by this House.
Some of the senators who had supported the
amendment in the committee changed their
votes. I want to refer particularly to one
honourable gentleman who changed his vote
and gave his reasons for so doing. He said-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
opening that discussion?

Are

we

re-

Hon. Mr. COTE: No, we are not reopening
the discussion, but I am making a comparison
between the treatment accorded to non-fighting men, men who rnay never enlist, and
that accorded to men who do enlist and risk
their lives in the front line. I am not reopening the other question; I merely wish,
in support of my present contention, to
make use of the argument used by that
honourable senator on that occasion. His
argument was that there should be no discrimination at all between members of the
forces. He said that Canada's army was one
army, made up of the permanent militia,

JUNE 13, 1941

men attested for overseas, and these youths
who are being trained; and he said that if
different treatment were extended to the different classes of troops, it would affect their
morale. He said, further, that the men were
trained in the same camps, that they were
lodged together, had their meals together,
and enjoyed the same sports, and that therefore, after giving further consideration to the
matter, he thought it necessary to change
his vote in favour of completely reinstating
the section in question in the pension law.
And it was reinstated.
My point is this. If we are going to burden
the public treasury with the possibility of the
payment of pensions, at the discretion of the
Pension Commissioner, to men who have never
given their consent to fight anywhereHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who have never
given what?
Hon. Mr. COTE: Who have never given
their consent to fight anywhereHon. Mr. DANDURAND: But they are
in until the end of the war, to fight and
defend Canada, and you may find them on
the coast, by the side of those who have
entered the Active Army, defending the country
and taking the same risk. Yet my honourable friend is trying to reopen a question
when there is nothing before the House.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I am not trying to
reopen the question. I am afraid the honourable leader of the House is not quite patient
enough. I have given my reason for mentioning this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can follow my
honourable friend, and I know his inner
thought.
Hon. Mr. COTE: When I was interrupted,
I was saying that if it is proper to provide
pensions, on compassionate grounds only, for
men who have not attested for service in
the defence of this countryHon. Mr. DANDURAND: While they are
training during the next two or four months?
Hon. Mr. COTE: At any time, sir.
If they are
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
doing that, they are serving the country.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The pension law makes
no difference, and I say, if that is the caseand it is the case-a fortiori, we should not
discriminate in our treatment of soldiers who
have attested for overseas service. That is
my argument. That is what was in my mind
when I made the short reference to the Pension Act. Possibly the leader of the House
may have thought I had something else in
mind, but that was all. I do not think the
14879-18J

,

267

regulation as to enlistment for service overseas is wise or generous. I do not see any
good reason for it, and I see some very
good reasons against it.
I just rose to express that opinion as a
member of this House. I have not beard it
expressed before during the session, and I
think it should have been expressed. I have
an idea that many honourable members of
this House agree with me, in their hearts,
that there should be no discrimination against
brave men who answer the urge to serve their
country and go overseas to fight our battles.
On the quesHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
tion of the number of children they haveHon. Mr. COTE: The children are part
of their families and part of themselves; they
are the dearest possession they have in life.
And if we make a distinction on the ground
of economy, I say it is not the kind of
economy we should be practising.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend could easily have called attention to
the question whether there was discrimination
between soldiers enlisting for active service
who have one or two children or none, and
soldiers who have more than two. He could
have raised that question without roving over
a debate on a matter which should have been
closed. I shall not answer my honourable
friend to-day, but shall draw this discussion
to the attention of the Minister of Defence
and give an answer to-morrow morning.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I think, to keep our records
straight, this discussion should appear as being
on the motion to adjourn.
Speaking to the claims of my honourable
friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Cote), I think it
is only fair to the Government to say that
the limitation referred to was suggested, from
this side of the House. I can well remember
the honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach) strongly urging that men
with sizable families should not be encouraged
to enlist, and indicating that the enlistment
of such men showed one of the grossest of
the unfairnesses which arose out of the
voluntary system of enlistment. The honourable gentleman, who has had considerable
experience, felt that the present regulation
would not be unfair to those with the larger
families.
While that is the case, I make only this
comment. The fact that to-day thousandstens, hundreds of thousands-of young men
with no tics and no special obligations are
closing their ears, are utterly indifferent, to
every appeal-attending theatres, races and

ball games, interested in strikes and balls
rather than guns-just illustrates the enormity,
or whatever you want to call it, of what we
are doing in this country. It all grows out
of the cruelly unjust, utterly illogical and
tragically inefficient system, or total absence
if system, to which we still adhere.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Unfortunately
I was unable to follow the last part of my
right honourable friend's statement. Would
he kindly tell me what was the point he
made?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What I say
is that cases such as have been referred to by
my honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr.
Coté) do exist. There are men with large
families who, notwithstanding their obligations
to them and to their homes, feel that they
must serve, while there are hundreds of
thousands with no such obligations who are
simply laughing at us, in our faces.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
for what?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I do not
know why. They do. They pay no attention
at all to our appeals. That all grows out of
the utterly iliogical, tragically inefficient and
cruelly unjust system, or lack of system, which
we have.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am very sorry
to hear my right honourable friend say that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

were they would be in the ranks, and we
should not be begging on our knees and
beseeching them, as we are to-day-a spectacle
that, with the enemy right in front of us,
seems to me simply appalling.
Hon. GITSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senators, as this is turning out to be a conversatior, I may as well join in. My honourable friend from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Coté) made the point that there is discrimination against enlisted soldiers who have
more than two children. That is the point. I
think we should stick to it. I do net sec any
reason for enlarging upon tîat and making a
camouflage plea for the imposition of conscription in Canada. Everybody seems to be
afraid to use that word. We may just as
well use it and do a little plain talking about
it. If we are too shy to speak the word,
we can call it compulsory military service, or
anything else, but what it means is conscription. As I say, the point made by my honourable friend from Ottawa East is that there is
discrimination as between enlisted soldiers who
have two children and those who have more.
I believe he is right in that. But I say again,
let us stick to the issue. As my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has said, in a
very nice and obliging way, he is going to
refer the matter te the Minister of National
Defence. To-morrow we shall have the
Minister's views, and his explanation-and
justification, as the case may be. I am eager
te hear his statement.
That is all there is to it, so far as I am
concerned.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

So am I.

lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Is my right
honourable friend net affirming that in the
country at large there is a lack of patriotism?
I do net admit that. If my right honourable
friend will read his remarks he will find he
has said that hundreds of thousands of people
are doing nothing but laugh at us. That is,
they are laughing at our perils, at the perils of
Canada and of the British Empire? I cannot
admit that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
what is in my mind at all. I say that
tens-yes, hundreds-of thousands, are laughing at our appeals, paying no attention at al]
to our appeals for recruits. And I say that

SEPARATION ALLOWANCES FOR
SOLDIERS' CHILDREN
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:

269

JUNE 14, 1941
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, 1 asked the Minister of Defence
for a statement in answer to the inquiry of
my honourable friend from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Coté) as to why allowances were not
paid for more than three dependents--the
wife and two children-of any soldier. 1 had
expected to receive a writtcn statement, but
an oral one was given. The situation is this.
During the war of 1914-1918 the Government
paid allowances to soldiers' wives, but made
no extra paymcnt on the hasis of the number
of children. Dependent children were taken
care of, for the most part, and the separation
allowances were supplemented, hy the Canadian Patriotic Fund, which collected moneys
from the public through campaigns carried on
from time to time. When war broke out
in September of 1939 the conditions of enlistment made provision for allowances to four
or more dependents. This provoked considerable protest, and it was urged in the Press and
in this Chamber, and in other quarters also,
that men with more than two children should
not be accepted for active service. As a result,
the regulation was amended, the soldier's
dependents eligible for allowances being
restricted to three persons-the wife and two
children.
I would remind honourable members that
the situation respecting soldýiers and their
dependents is much more favourable at present
than it was during the period of 1914-18.
The soldiers themselves are receiving a higher
scale of pay, and the official allowances to
their dependents are larger. Whether those
allowances are equivalent to the total amounts
that soldiers' dependents received during the
last war in separation allowances and in payments from the Canadiap Patriotic Fund,I1
am flot in a position to state.
My honourable friend based bis protest on
the provision in certain circumstances of compassionate pensions to trainees injured while in
training. Hie contended that trainees were
undergoing the same training as the militia
receîved in peace time, and were not on an
equal footing, as Vo sacrifice, with men who
had enlisted for service overseas. That is
absolutely erroneous. Those young men will
continue in the Canadian army for the duration of the war, and will serve wherever they
are needed for the defence of Canada. They
are undergoing a very tborough training to
qualify them to serve either on the Atlantic
or the Pacifie coast. I may say that a considerable proportion of the men who have
been taking the four months' training with
members of the Active Army have signified
their intention of attesting for service anywhere. I cannot speak with certainty as to

their numabers, but my honourable friend from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) and the right
honourable leader on the other side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) will find that these men
will constitute a reservoir of considerable
value. They have trained arduously and
severely under the system carried on, and
must flot be Iooked down upon as if they occupied a position in the service of the country
inferior to that of the men who have volunteered to go anywhere. It may happen that
both groups wiII he found fighting side by
side in this country, or that many of the
trainees will go overseas among those who
have volunteered for such service.
I shaîl add just one further word. Between
1914 and 1917, during the regime of my hionourable friends opposite, 400,000 men wcre
raised under the voluntary system. Those
men could not be accused of failing to show
a proper spirit of patriotism. I recali that the
honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) said that to take the place of the
bands that once marched through the streets
of our towns and cities there was need for
some kind of propaganda for the purpose of
assisting in the endeavour to gather recruits
for the war. There may he something in
what the honourable gentleman said, but I
may informa the House that the propaganda
and the recruiting campaign carried on for the.
Iast week or so have gathered momentum',,
and everywhere we hear that recruiting is:
So there is no,
proceeding satisfactorily.
reason to think our young men of to-day are.of weaker moral fibre than those of 1914-1&.

BILL No. 4

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 103, an Act for granting to His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1942.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: When
shall this Bill be read a second time?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND, with leave
of the Senate, moved the second reading of
the Bill.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill

heaviest levy that has been made by ParliaThe
ment upon the people of Canada.
appropriation is required for the purpose of
carrying the war to a victorious issue. I shall
not go into the details of this measure, for
we have had occasion to discuss its contents
while dealing with various bills authorizing
these expenditures.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
as usual, the Supply Bill, which provides for
the moneys required for the ordinary public
service, reaches us when we are all about to
disperse north, south, east and west to the
four corners of Canada. In this House, for
reasons that are well known, it is not the
practice to deal with the details of such a
measure, though there are occasions when
some unusual or extraordinary expenditure
proposed may lead to a somewhat lengthy
discussion. I intend to deal with only one
phase of the Estimates, and with that very
briefly.
On checking the Estimates for this year I find
that, altogether apart from the huge sums
voted for war purposes, they provide for a
total expenditure of $433,000,000. In addition
to this sum there is an item of, I think,
$35,000,000, for expenditure under the policy
adopted by the Government regarding crop
reduction, but as this, in a large sense, is
emergency expenditure related to the war
itself, and may not be expected to continue,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

I will not take it into account. On looking
at last year's Estimates I find that they provided a sum of $451,000,000; so we now have
an apparent reduction of some $18,000,000,
the difference between the $451,000,000 voted
last year and the $433,000,000 now appropriated.
In considering these figures, however, it must
be borne in mind that in the Estimates of
last year there were two items which do
not appear in the present Bill. One was the

vote of $19,000.000 to cover unemployment
relief and special services generally, to be
administered by the Labour Department, and
the other was the sum of $15,000,000 to take
care of Canadian National Railway expenditures, presumably deficits. These two items,
omitted from this year's Estimates because
they are not required, totalled $34,000,000:
so in a comparison of this year's Estimates
with last year's the figures should really be
$417,000,000 as against $433,000,000.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
mentioned?

What are the figures

Hon. Mr. CALDER: For last year $417,000,000, and for this year $433,000,000, not
including the $35,000,000 appropriated in connection with crop reduction.
The point I wish to speak on for just a
moment is this. We all realize what the
situation is. We all realize the tremendous
financial burden being carried by Canada.
There is not an honourable member of this
House or of the other House who does not
know what is taking place in that respect, and
what is likely to take place in the future.
The burden is great to-day, but it is sure to
be greater to-morrow. Taxation is high now,
but it will be higher to-morrow. It seems to
me that the Government should eut out every
expenditure that possibly can be eut out. I
know it is not easy to do that. I have had
experiences in that direction, and I am aware
that at times it is most difficult to eut out
an expenditure. There are many reasons for
the difficulty.
It may be that members of the Government, occupied as they are with so many
things, could not give to this matter the
attention it really should have. Busy men,
burdened ten, twelve or fifteen hours a day,
have not the time to deal with this problem.
It has often seemed to me that the Government should establish some sort of body to
go into every department of the publie service
and eliminate every dollar of expenditure that
can be eliminated. I am sure all honourable
members would agree with that. From my
experience in connection with governments I
know that m-any expenditures could be lopped
off at this time. I do hope that before the

JUNE 14, 1941
year rolls around the Government will take
such steps as are necessary to see to it that
the expenditure for everything that is not
essential, for everything that is not connected
with our war effort, is reduced to the lowest
possible point.
I am sure the Government must have made
efforts along this line. It must be interested
in this phase of our financial problem, and
in the burden that our people are carrying
and will have to continue to carry. I take
it for granted that members of the Government are desirous of reducing expenditure
wherever possible. If they have not the
opportunity to give personal attention to
the matter, then, I say, for goodnes sake let
them appoint some person or persons to act
for them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is quite right when he says that doubtless the Government has done its best to
compress expenditures. As he has sat in
Council, he knows that each department
sends in its estimates, and these are carefully
checked with expenditures made in the year
before.
There is very much to be said in favour of
my honourable friend's suggested plan for
reducing departmental expenditures. I do not
,know whether such a plan could be made
effective, and, if so, to what extent or how.
I will see to it that my honourable friend's
suggestion is conveyed to the Government.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SENATE

The Effeet of Rising Prices
It stands to reason that aIl the goods and
services we are accustomed to enjoy in peace
time cannot be provided when only a little
more than half our energies can be spared to
provide them. Most goods and services are
becoming inoreasingly searce and will become
searcer still. We must face the problem of
sharing what is searce. If we ]et prices rise
unduly, we know what will happen. Ask any
housewife. For no one feels the effect of rising
prices more than the housewife.
Rising prices-a rising cost of living-do not
have the same effect on all households. The
naller the fýamily income and the lairger the
family, the more serious the hardship imposed.
For those with small :incomes, rising prices of
clothing, food and other neeessaries may mean
serions hardship, whiie for- those with larger
incomes only luxu'ries and small comforts may
have to he given up.
Rising prices thus serve to aggravate the
inequalities in society, and te throw the heaviest
burdens on those least able to bear them. Wartime experience bas shown that prices rise
faster than wages or salaries, and bear more
heavily still on those who live on small pensions or life savings.
Nor is the position of the farmer any happier
than that of the wage-earners. The present war
is a war of machines. Because of the beavy
demands of war on industry, the scarcity of
m.anufactured goods is likely to be greater
than the scareity of farm products. The rise
in prices will consequently be unequal, if prices
,are left to themselves. The things farmers
have to buy tend to go up in price, more ian
the things they have to sell.
Moreover. some farm prices left to themselves would not rise at ,all under present
circumstances. This is notably true of the price
of whe.at, although there are other products
'in the same class. It is recognized, however.
that wheat and other no-n-perishable products.
held in reserve, constitute an invalu.able war
aýsset. Agriculture itself is a national asset
which must be preserved. The uncontrolled
rise of prices would throw an intolerable
burden upon wheat farmers and others similarly
situated. Their situation differs from what it
was in the last war. At that time, we had
fewer acres, by many millions, in production.
We produced much less wheat. There were more
allies to feed.
The truth is that all but an insignificant
minority of the populat-ion would be worse off
as -a result of rising prices, if prices were permitted to rise unchecked, and, in general, the
relatively poor would suffer more than the
relativeiy well-to-do.
Government Control of Prices Generally
I thilnk I have said enough to make it clear
why the Government is unwilling, as a means of
reducing consumption, to allow prices to rise
unchecked. That would be the easy way out of
the immediate difficulty. But it would be unfair
and unjust now, and perileus for the future.
Therefore, the Government bas decided to halt
the rise of prices; to undertake the control of
all prices; and, where necessary, to take other
steps to control civilian consumption in fair and
equitable ways.
Let me pause to interject a word of warning.
There is no panacea or cure-all for the evil of
rising prices. The Government does net pretend
te have a magie formula which can be applied.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

We are all aware that the task of controlling
prices is very difficult. It bas not been easy to
control prices even in totalitarian countries
which can enforce their controls by brutal
methods which no free country would contemplate. In a democratie country, price control
cannot succeed without the active support and
co-operation of the mass of the people.
From the outset of the war, the Government
lias been aware that the problem of a general
rise in prices would ultimately have to be faced.
We felt it advisabIe, however, to postpone the
control of all prices, until it was really necessary. Complete control involves many complications and restrictions; moreover, it requires a
large staff to administer the machinery of
enforcement. It was clearly undesirable te take
men's services from other tasks one moment
before they were needed.
It is only in recent months that the necessity
for the control of prices generally bas become
cieariy apparent. In the summer of 1939, prices
were abnormally low.
This was particularly
true of many agricultural products. The price
increases of the early months of the war were,
in most cases, little more than a healthy recovery
froi the low levels obtaining when war broke
out. This recovery of prices had the effect of
stimulating the employment of labour and

capital.

During the next twelve months, prices

were relatively stable.
The price increases
which did occur resulted, in most cases, from
one or other of the following causes:
the
premium on United States' funds; the rapid
increase in ocean freight rates; war taxation
on a wide range of commodities; and the normal
recovery of excessively low agricultural prices.
During this period a control of the prices of
individual ciomodities worked satisfactorily. AI]
price changes were. of course, carefully watched
by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. When
the prices of individual commodities or groups
of commodities threatened to rise unduly or
suddenly, the Board acted promptly.
For

example, at the beginning of the war, the panicbuying of sugar was quickly checked. Speculating was stopped; hoarding was stopped; profiteering was stopped. In regions where there was
an acute shortage of housing, rent control was

applied.

This piecemeal method could be used,

when the problems arose piecemeal. To-day we
face a different situation. We have entered
the period of full employment.
The upward

trend of prices has become too widespread and
powerful to be checked adequately by controlling
the prices of a few commodities. To continue
to attempt to control the rise in prices, piecemeal, might only serve to augment the very evil
it is desired to avoid, by occasioning, through
fear of the future, a precipitate rise in the prices
of those commodities which are not already controlled. The problem is a general probiem, and
it calls for general treatment. It lias spread
just as the war lias spread.
The Government lias, therefore, decided to
halt the rise in the prices of all goods or services
sold in Canada by imposing a general ceiling on
prices. By a ceiling is meant an upper limit
above which prices will not be allowed to rise.

Theoretically, this is a simple policy, but the
Government realizes fully how great the practical
administrative difficulties are. It will call for
uew and complicated administrative imachinery.
It will interfere with established methods of
running business; it will impose irksome restrietions; and its success will depend, not alone

NOVEMBER 3, 1941
upon the Government, but equally upon the
willingness of ail who are affected to accept, and
to accept cheerfully, the limitations imposed
upon thern as a necessary contribution to Canada's maximum war effort.
Mothod of Stabilizing Prices
This is what we propose to do. It is simple
to understand.
It will be more difficuit to
perform. On and after November 17, 1941, no
person may seIl any goods or supply any services ut a price or rate higher ithan the maximum price or rate charged by him for such
goods or services during the four weeks from
September 15 to October 11, of the present ycar.
In other words, prices are to be halted at a
Except in
level they have aiready reached.
cases where minimum prices are fixed, prices
will be free to f ail below the ceiling.
Full details of the policy will be made publie
later, but I can say now that the limit or ceiling
on prices will apply te ail goods, except sales for
expert. It wiil aise apply to ail rentais. The~
limit wili aiso apply to the rates charged for
electricity, gas, steam heat, and water; telegraph, wireless and telephone services; the transportation of goods and persons and the provision
of dock, harbour and pier facilities; warehousing and storage; undertaking and embaiming;
laundering; cleaning; tailoring and dressmaking;
hairdressing and related services; plumbing and
heating; painsting and decorating; repairing of
ail kinds; the supplyinig of meals, refreshments
and beverages. Power is given to the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board to add te this list. In
the case ef most agricuitural produets and fish,
the maximum prices will be based upen market
prices during the four weeks prier te October
il, rather than upon the actual selling prices of
individuai farmers or fishermen.
The imposition of a price-ceiling wiil ensure
that the hardships and scarcities resulting from
the steadily încreasing requirements of war
will be more equitably spread among the whole
people.
Control of Production Costs: Stabilization
of Wages
I come now te the next feature of the policy
et controlling the cost of living. It is obvious
that the prices of finished goods cannot be
controlled successfully unless the cost of production is aise controlled. Wages are a large
eiement in the cost of producing the manufactured goods required by consumera. That is
why the cost of living cannot be controlled
uniess wages are aise stabilized. The policy of
limiting t he rise of wages is in ether words, a
vital part of the policy dï safeguarding the
wage-earners, as consumers, f rom. the evil effeets
of a rising cost of living. With the policy of
stabilizing wages the Goveruiient is extending
its policy ef safeguardîng the earnings of the
wage-earners.
A beginning was made in working eut a
wage policy at the end of last year when what
is called Order in Council P.C. 7440 was
enacted. This Order, which. was for the guidance of boards ef conciliation, fixed basic wage
rates in general at the relativeiy high level
then existing. It provided that sub-normal
wages could b e adjusted upward and that any
further upward adjustment in wages should
be by way ef a cost-of-iiving bonus. While
this experiment has been 'wideiy accepted by
exaployers and employees in war industry, certain defecta in the precedure must now be

remedied. Industries net engaged in war production have nlot been subject te this control.
Wage rates of many of these industries have
continued te rise. lu ethers there has been no
rise te offset the increased cost of living. Even
in the war industries, because et the increasing
scarcity of labeur and the absence of penalties
for violation, the policy was net cempleteiy
successful. This has been unfair te those
employers and empleyees in industry whe loyally
acecepted the policy.
After consultation with representatives ef
the provinces, ef employers anq employees, the
Government has found general agreement with
its view that its wartime wages policy could
succeed. only if it were broadened and strengthened and i f machinery were estabiished for its
enforcement.
Extension et Goverament Wartîme Wage
Polîcy
The Goverumen-t has therefore decided te
extend its wartime wage Policy te cover ail
industry. The only exception will be certain
smnaller employers who are excluded solely for
administrative reasons. Henceforward ne employer in Canadian inýdustry or commerce may,
without permission, increase his present basic
wage rates.
Af ter November 15 every employer wili be
obliged te pay a bonus ln accordance with the
terms specified by government order, and te
adj est the bonus regularly every three menthe
in accordance with a definite formula. The
bonuses now being paid wiil require te be
adjusted te the cost-of-iiving index as of the
effective date. lu future ail employers will pay
a bonus on the samne basis. Penalties wiil be
imposed for failure te cemply with the order.
The administrative mnaehinery will consist of
a National War Labour Board and several
regional War Labour Boards. Each will bie
equally representative et employers and employees.
They will supervise a co-operative
inspection and enforcement service by the joint
staffs of the Dominion and Provincial Departments et Labour. One of the primary functions
et the Boards will be to observe how the policy
works in practice and te recommend its revision
or modification in the lîght of experience. The
Boards wiil aise be expected te advise the
Minister ot Labour about the further development ot policy in ail matters relating te labour
and industriai relations.
Despite the caretul thought given te the
plan, it will ne doubt have te be improved ini
detail trom. time te time. It is a step terward
inte new territory; success will depend upon
the ce-operation accorded by employers and
workers, andi net ieast by the support of the
censuming public.
The Position et Agriculture
In undertaking te contrel the cost of living,
particular attention has been given by the
Geverament to the effect of its policy on the
position of agriculture. The poiicy touches the
farmer in two ways. The principle ot the
price-ceiling will bie applied te agricultural
prices, while, at the samne time, total agricultural inceme wili be eupported, where necessary, by government action. In other words,
while wages and the prices of f arm. products
wiil be stabiiized, the inceme of both labour
and agriculture will be safeguarded.
Agricultural prices, with a tew conspicueous
exceptions, especially wheat, are higher te-day
than they have been at any time during the
past ten years. Ia cases where agricultural

276

SENATE

prices have not kept pace with increases in
costs of production, measures are being taken
to bring about a more satisfactory relationship
without significantly affecting the general level
of retail prices to the consumer.
The major problem of maintaining incomes
in Western Canada, where grain growing is
the largest source of income, is closely related
to the problem in Eastern Canada vhere feed
supplies are not sufficient to enable farmers te
produce the bacon and dairy products required
for Britain and ourselves. Both these situations need adjustment. It is therefore the
intention of the Government to make supplementary payments to farmers in the spring
wheat area, on the basis of their cultivated
acreage as defined under the Prairie Farm
For farmers in Eastern
Assistance Act.
Canada, the Government will provide the
transportation costs on feed grain and other
feed frous Fort William or Port Arthur to
points in Eastern Canada.
In determining the price of farm products,
it is obvious that the maximum price cannot
be based upon the individual seling prices of
individual farmers, which is the method applied
to factories and stores. Instead, the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board will determine maximum prices for certain farm products on the
basis of maximum market prices during the
four-week period ending on October Il last.
Other special adaptations may be found
necessary. Thus, in the case of farm products
whose prices rise and fall seasonally, the setting
of maximum prices may also require the setting
of minimum prices, or action to remove temporary surpluses from the market. In most
cases, however, the demand for food products,
as
especially the export demand, is so great if to
at
assure that prices will not fall much,
all, below the maximum. For example, in the
cases of bacon and chesse, reasonably stable
rices have been or will ba assured under
arge-scale agreements with the United Kingdom.
The Wartime Prices and Trade Board will,
before November 17, take the necessary
action, or advise the Government as to the
steps which should be taken, to achieve these
objectives without violating the basic principle
of the general price-ceiling.
Control of Prices and Wages an Essential of
War Policy
The comprehensive measures which I have
just outlined constitute a logical development
of the economic and financial policy initiated
by the Government at the outset of the war.
But we must bear in mind that the control of
prices, by itself, will not ensure the cutting
down of consumption, and it will only indirectly
affect the direction of private spending. Other
measures are required to safeguard adequate
supplies of commodities needed by the Government for war purposes. To give direction to
private spending, definite restrictions have
already been imposed on both production and
consumption.
Restrictions have already been placed on the
purchase of machine tools, aluminum and other
metals. iron and steel, foreign exchange; on the
production of automobiles, stoves, washing
machines, refrigerators, radios; on the sale of
gasoline, bacon and cheese. Restrictions have
also been placed on new construction for purposes other than war and on the production of
capital goods. These restrictions have been
directed against the use of scarce commodities
by civilian consumers. More recently there has
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

been a significant broadening of this policy of
restriction through the order of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board relating to instalment
buying.
Further restrictions will have to be imposed

of the factors contributing to the rise in prices
which the Goverument is now undertaking to
control. Steps may have to be taken to see
that the necessities of life are fairly distributed.
In embarking upon the policy of price control
by means of a general ceiling on prices, the
Government realizes that it will not be possible
to maintain the exact price structure, in every
particular, as it exists at the date on which
the prices are to be fixed. The ceiling will not
be absolutely rigid and entirely unchangeable.
The control and stabilization of the general
price level is the considered policy, but the
detail will be a matter of administration in the
hands of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.
Co-operation on the Part of All Essential to
Success
Let me repeat: The policy of control as it
affects industry, commerce, agriculture and
labour, demands a degree of restriction to
which Canadians hitherto have been quite

as it deserves, the whole-hearted support of
everyone who has the well-being of his fellowcitizens at heart. In these perilous times, we
must not shrink from any course of action
which will help to preserve and strengthen the
morale of our country.
By its policy the Government hopes to avoid
the fears, the sense of insecurity, the suffering
and the profiteering which the inflation of
prices inevitably brings in its train. The
measures now being announced should help in
the winning of the war, and, after the war,
facilitate recovery and reconstruction.
This policy enunciated by the Prime Minister was embodied in Order in Council P.C.
8527, dated November 1, 1941, which I also
desire to place on Hansard:

Privy Council

At the Government House at Ottawa
Saturday, the lst day of November, 1941.
Present:
His Excellency
The Governor General in Council:
Whereas the steadily increasing need by
Canada and her Allies for the necessaries of war
has diverted and will further divert a broad
range of materials and services from the requirements of Canadian consumers to the requirements of war;
And Whereas such diversion and the increasing purchasing power of consumers will, if
unchecked, create undesirable inflation of prices
and accompanying increase in the cost of living
which may be followed by undesirable depression when such diversion ceases;
And Whereas therefore it is deemed to be
necessary and advisable for the security and

NOVEMBER 3, 1941
welfare of Canada that maximum prices for all
goods and services in Canada be fixed and that
the regulations hereinafter set forth be made
and established;
And Whereas it is expedient and in the
national interest that such regulations be
administered by the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board under its powers conferred by the
Wartime Prices and Trade Regulations;
Now, therefore, His Excellency the Governor
General in Council on the recommendation of
the Minister of Finance and under and by
virtue of the powers conferred on the Governor
General in Council by the War Measures Act,
Chapter 206, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927,

(e)

(f)

bonus pursuant to P.C. 7440 of 16th
December, 1940, as amended, shall add
to the amount of such bonus an amount
based as hereinafter provided on the
rise in the index number for October,
1941, above the most recent index number used to determine the current amount
of such bonus.
Effective for the first payroll period
beginning on or after February 15, 1942,
each employer who is not then paying a
bonus in accordance with the provisions
of this order shall pay a bonus in an
amount based as hereinafter nrovided on
the rise in the index number for January,
1942, above the index number for
October, 1941, or for such earlier month,
not earlier than the effective date of the
last general increase in wages paid by
him and not earlier than August, 1939,
as the National Board finds fair and
reasonable.
The rise or fall in the index shall be
measured in points, to the nearest onetenth of one point, after the index bas
been adjusted to the base of 100-0 for
August, 1939.
For each rise of one point in the index,
the amount of the bonus or the increase
in the amount of the bonus, as the case
may be. and for each fall of one point in
the index, the decrease in the amount of
the bonus, shall be:(i) twenty-five cents per week for all
aduit male employees, and for al
other employees employed at basic
wage rates of twenty-five dollars or
more per week, and

The amount of the bonus shall be rorietermined every three months (viz. effective
for the first pavroll periods beginning on
or after the fifteenth day of the months
of February, May. August and November,
respeotively) on the basis of the change
in the cost of living shown by the index
number for the imnmediately preceding
month (viz. January, April, July and
October) as compared wirth the index
number on which the List previous change
in the amount of the bonus was based.
The amount of the bonus shall not te
changed unless the cost of living has
changed one whole point or more. Whother
the bonus shall be changed, and, if so,
the increase or decrease in its amount, as
the case may be, shall be determined and
announced by the Board in accordance
witi the provisions of this subsection and
subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
The bonus shall be payable only with
respect to employsment at basic wage rates,
not including overtime. For any pay
period during which an employee is employed and paid for less than the normal
full time hours of wtork at basic wage
rates te shall be paid that proportion of
his full time bonus which the number of
hours te actually worked at basic wage
rates is of the normal full time hours of
work in that period.

of unemployment. We were emerging from a
depression-a depression period during which
the Dominion, provincial and municipal governments spent nearly one billion dollars to relieve
the situation caused by the existence of this
unemployment condition.
During that period relief camps were established, provision was made for the transfer of
workers, many helpful measures to assist unemployed were instituted, not alone for the benefit
of unemployed, but in the general interest of
the State.
The advent of the war brought about an
entirely different condition.
It became immediately evident that the whole
man-power of this country, in co-operation with
the other nations who were members of the
British Commonwealth of Nations, would have
to he concentrated in an effort to crush the
present totalitarian menace to our democratie
way of life.
Where we had heretofore required to deal
with unemployment, it became obvious-in fact,
inevitable-that employment would increase to
a degree that would require the services and
the assistance of every man and woman in
Canada.
This increased demand for man-power will
continue to increase. Since August, 1939, the
number employed in industry has increased
from 2,300,000 to 3,100,000-an increase of over
800,000, or 35 per cent-and it will increase
still further.
There is, too, another factor. In our war
services-our Army, our Navy, and our Air
Force--we have enlisted an additional 500,000
men. This number, too, will inevitably increase.
But this does not tell the whole story. Our
present and immediate war-time effort will be
increased and the demand for labour will be

record of all the rights, the ternis and conditions which labour gives up during the wartime period. This is for the purpose that these
concessions which labour makes will be restored
in a generous manner when the war is over
and the victory has been won.
The fact that we are at war is admittedly
the sole and only justification for Government
interference with the operation of the economic
law of demand and supply and with the privileges which labour has won over a period of
the lasat one hundred years. Except for the
existence of war there could be no justification.
But there are fundamental reasons why this
Order stabilizing wages should be passed at
this time.
They mnay be summarized as follows:
In the first place, it is the intention of the
Government that wage earners in this country
will enjoy real, and not merely nominal or
imaginary, wages. A
situation developed
duriug the last war that while wages increased
substantially, at no time did wages rise as
rapidly as the cost of living. In other words.
a dollar was net really a dollar, because its
purchasing power was mueh less than the
previous purchasing power which the dollar
enjoyed.
2. Wages will he stabilized on an extremely
fair basis. Provision has been made, too, that
wage rate levels at present prevailing shall not
be decreased.
3. It has been provided, too, by the Order
that a National War Labour Board shall be
set up to administer and enforce the general
principles of the Order. and such Board shall
be equally representative of both labour and
industry.
4. It should, too, be borne in mind that any
ceiling placed on wages does not prevent an
increase in wages that are, in the opinion of
the Board, too low.
5. It should aise be remembered that important as this Order is respecting vages. it is one
of several measures outlined by the Prime
Minister on Saturday last, which the Government of Canada proposes te take te stabilize
net only wages. but prices which regulate and
control the cost of living.
The principles governing the present Order
in Council are as follows:
1. It extends Order in Couneil commonly
known as 7440, providing for wage stabilizatien, te all industry and does net confine it as
heretofore te war industry alene. There are
certain limitations placed in the measure on
the volume of employment in any industry;
nanely: the Order will apply te the construction industry if it employs ten or more persons.
In other industries it will apply if fifty or more
are employed.
Secondly, it makes the cost-of-living bonus
mandatory, and such bonus must be paid by ail
industries. Definite periods for the payment
are provided in the Order.
There is one exception, and one only, te this
mandatory provision; that is, where any
employer can clearly show the National War
Labour Board that it is unable te pay such
cost-of-living bonus. In this event the Board
will have the power te direct that the payment
shall be deferred, but it will be subject, however, te such terms and conditions as the Board
may determine.
Thirdly, penalties are provided in the event
of non-compliance by any employer with the
terms of the Order.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Fourthly, definite machinery, in the form of
the National War Labour Board, is provided
te secure the due enforcement of the provisions
of the Order.
It is obvious that the extension of this Order
te all industry necessarily involved the consideration of the matter of provincial rights.
On that account, on October 14 last, the
Ministers of Labour of the various provinces
were invited te come te Ottawa with a view te
ascertaining if they were prepared te se
co-operate. They then expressed the view that
in their belief such co-operation would be very
helpful in our war effort; and they once again
reiterated the stand which they have always
taken in labour matters-namely, that they
would assist the Dominion Government in every
possible manner in the prosecution of the war.
They were net asked te execute any formal
agreement. They were asked if co-operation
could be secured in the establishment of
Regional Boards necessary te carry out the
terms of the Order. To this no objection was
raised.
But until this assurance was received from
the provincial Ministers of Labour, no one else
could possibly have been consulted. In the
improbable event of their refusing such ceoperation, it would be futile te discuss the
policy with representatives of either labour
or industry.
However, on the day following such meeting
with the provincial Ministers of Labour, the
Prime Minister and myself met the following
labour representatives: the President of the
Trades and Labour Congress, the Vice-President of the Railway Brotherhood, the President
of the Canadian Congress of Labour, and the
President of the Confederation of Catholie
Workers. The Prime Minister advised them
as te the general policy the Government had
given consideration te and in the general
interest of the country proposed te adopt. He
stated that it was the wish of the Government
that the various measures whieh it was proposed te enact would be calculated te prevent
any undue inflationary spiral.
He further
stated that such measures would operate te the
benefit of net only the working people of
Canada but, as well, te the housewives, te the
consumers, te industry and te every other
section of our population. That would assist
net only during the wartime period, but as well
in the aftermath of the war.
The labour representatives suggested that in
view of the importance of the proposed legislatien it might be desirable te submit the proposais te the National Labour Supply Couneil.
This recommendation was adopted and on the
next day the proposed Order was submitted te
the Council.
Certain amendments te the Order were suggested by the Council and a number of such
were adopted.
Certain amendments, on the
other hand, were suggested te the Order which
the Government felt it would be undesirable
te adopt.
It has been suggested that insufficient time
was given for consultation with those whe were
affected by the Order. The Government, however, must in the last analysis assume responsibility for its policies. And I have indicated
the measure of consultation which the Government had with those most interested in the
adoption of the policy.
If is the hope of the Government that the
adoption of the present measures calculated
te check this spiral of inflation will be generally
helpful te all our citizens. As the Prime Min-

NOVEMBER 3, 1941
ister pointed out, any legislation of this kind
requires the good will and the gener-all support
of the people of thie country. The Government
believes that this legislation is in the general
public interest and will help in the winning
of this war. Its acceptance by labour, by industry, by agriculture, by consumers, by housewives, by all others affected, will be of tremendous benefit and will insmure its success.
The Government lias received a wide measure
of cooperation fror labour. The fact that
this is so is shown when I state that there
is not in this country to-day one single strike
in any war industry. Labour must be given
the credit for this condition.
For example, we had a slowtdown in the coalmining industry in Nova Scotia. To-day thiat
indust.ry is producing more coal than at any
previous time in the history of the province.
And there should not be any such thing as
a strike in any industry conneeted with the
war. Whatever wrong thing might generate a
etrike in war industry is a monstrous thing
and must be dealit wiith.
The steady advance of the terrors of slavery
and of Nazi-ism has marked the progressive
march over many peaceful lands. It has not
only knocked down the gates of the powerful,
but i-t has toTn down 'and burned the little
shrines, the hard-won, the painfully guarded,
the pitiful little treasures of the poor, the
meagre necessities of life of those many who
.in every country in the world make that
country whait it ie. It has been well said that
"The nation in every country dwelle in the
cottage."
Daily. since September, 1939, that tramp,
tramp, tramp lias resounded clearer as it has
cone closer to our own sheltered homes-our
homes under safe roofs and under less threatening skies. It -has also come much closer to those
who went from our sheltered homes across the
sees to meet rit, to defy it, to conquer it, and
to stil it for ever.
We now have heavy taxation of all profits
to promote the common cause. No longer may
any man in Canada become rich by the exploitation of his fellow men.
We have agreed to limit the rise of prices.
We are peggng them down. We have fixed
them sE tint wages will be real wages and not
nominal wages, eaten up and devoured by
hig ber prices.
We are at this time trying our best to
introduce provisions safeguarding the workers
of this country seo that increases in the cost
of living, no matter from what cause, shall be
charged to ithe work and not to the worker.
And I know, and you know, tiat there is no
fair-thinking man in Canada but believes at
this time that any interruption in our war
work-whether caused by greed, or by the petulance of insulted prestige, or by the elbowing
of selfish men, in unions or out of them-or
from whatever other cause--will call down the
nighteous wrath of a whole nation.
The first duty of any nation is the duty to
survive!
That survival is definitely challenged by cur
enemies. Will we not through the perilous and
uncertain years to come--without halting, without pausing or faltering-meet that challenge?
Wilil we net meet .it, and beat it back, and
beat it down? We may then, all of us together
as a great nation, united in a common cause,
look forward to better and to greater things,
with hope, wirth optimiem, and with a forthright determination to perform our duty and be
unashamed.

I believe that it will be useful to 'honourable senators to have these documents in
Hansard, for, in my opinion, they are of very
great importance and represent the most
extraordinary policy ever propounded in a
democratic country for the control of prices
and wages, which, as honourable gentlemen
know, go together.
Hon. W. H. DENNIS: Honourable senators, while I have the greatest possible
respect for the broadcasting system of this
country, and am myself interested in broadcasting to a small extent, I would respectfully
suggest that the press services of this country
and the newspapers should be included with
the broadcasting corporation in view of the
fact that virtually every newspaper in Canada
carried the Prime Minister's speech.
I accept
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend's suggestion and will
call the speech, not merely a radio address,
but a national broadicast. The idea which
prompted me to ask for its incorporation in
Hansard was that the policy of the present
Government was expressed by the Prime
Minister in a most important statement transmitted by radio, and, as my honourable friend
will appreciate, if it were not placed on
record in the Senate this Chamber would have
no official notice of it. Radio broadcasting is,
of course, a develaopment of modern times.
The Prime Minister felt that in order to
hasten the application of the new policy,
which everybody was awaiting, the public
should be apprised of it as soon as possible,
because, after all, it is the public who will
have to co-operate in the policy and stand
the resultant imposition. This explains the

though a surprise, was welcomed by everybody. The United States have not dared to
propound a similar policy, but are working
towards it, though with some timidity. Perhaps they will approach it more rapidly because of our action.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I am sure no one on this side of the
House will object to the reference which has
been made to the appearance on our records
of these important statements by the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Labour. Personally I agree with the action taken. As the
right honourable leader has just said, it is
the most important piece of legislation that has
ever been introduced in this country during
the long history of the Parliament of Canada,
or, possibly, in any other country. I think the
measure has been favourably received throughout the Dominion. The one thing which
astonishes me and other members of this Parliament is that a measure of such great import-

284

SENATE

ance should have been rushed 'through under
the War Measures Act, instead of being introduced in Parliament, in the regular way, so
that it could be fully debated by the 245
members in another place who represent the
various districts of Canada. The measure is
full of difficulties. If it had been introduced
in another place and thoroughly discussed
there the Government would have obtained a
lot of valuable information, which would have
eased the task of those who have the great
responsibility of seeing that the legislation is
carried through in every detail. I can imagine
what the Prime Minister would have said if
the party te which I belong had been in
power and passed legislation of this kind. We
should have heard a great deal about the
supremacy of Parliament, the flouting of Parliament, and so on.
I do net wish to dwell at any length on these
points, but I do seriously say it is to be
regretted that the measure was not introduced
in the regular way in the other House, debated
there and then brought here. Had that been
done, the views of honourable senators would
have been exprcssed in this House and in cornmittee, and the whole matter considered in
the way that all measures, especially one of
this kind, should be.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.
If my
honourable friend will allow me, I would put
a question to him. He knows that this legislation under the War Measures Act is very
complex and detailed. It was prepared with
great care by the heads of departments and
other experts surrounding the Government,
and given most serious study. Despite the
threat of inflation, how long would this
measure, full of difficulties as it is, have
remained in the House of Commons before
reaching here?
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I can say this,
that Parliament was only adjourned and could
have been summoned in twenty-four hours.
After all, under freedom and democracy
Parliament bas enjoyed certain liberties and
powers, which we hope will be continued. I
do think that this legislation would net have
been delayed by either House an unduly long
time, and I repeat that the discussions that
would have arisen would have been of great
value to the Government.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
without going over the same ground as that
covered by the honourable the acting leader
on this side of the House (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) I want to mention another point.
The right honourable leader of the Government (Right lon. Mr. Dandurand) said this
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

was a complex piece of legislation. Well, I
think that complex legislation has come before
this House and the other House many times.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: So that answer does not
lie. The measure was announced only two or
three days ago, and Parliament was to reconvene to-day. There was no reason why it
could net have been introduced in another
place, dealt with there and then brought to
this House. In another place there is machinery which makes it possible to avoid
long delays with legislation if the Government wants to avoid them. So the right
honourable gentleman's answer on that point
also does net lie. It is remarkable that the
Government did not take the proper course
to ensure full publicity being given to the
provisions contained in the Order in Council.
Such publicity would have been assured had
those provisions been presented to Parliament,
for the discussion of them in the House of
Commons and in this Chamber would have
appeared in the newspapers, and the public
would have been in a position to understand
what was being done.
After perusing the Order in Council very
carefully I am not at all sure that it can be
enforced. I can understand that if, te meet
the urgent need for munitions and war equipment, you restrict the production of domestic
goods to 85 per cent of the maximum production in pre-war years, prices will rise in consequence. We were told both in Parliament
and in the country that the purpose of the
tremendous increase in our income tax -and
the imposition of a defence tax of 5 per cent,
later increased to 7 per cent, was to control
excess profits and wages and restrain, if not
prevent, the spending of money on goods of
various kinds. One theory or the other must
be wrong, for if by taxation we take extra
earnings from the public they will not have
the money to spend on goods. In short, we
cannot get it both going and coming.
I am persuaded that the public will take a
long time to understand this legislation by
Order in Council. Let me illustrate. I go
into a little shop in Winnipeg where I have
my shoes shined, and the men there say:
"Oh, you are the fellow we want to talk to.
What about that Unemployment Insurance
Bill? We did not know we came under that
Bill and had to pay unemployment insurance
tax."
I reply, "WeIl, it was discussed in
Parliament and that discussion was reported
in all the newspapers." They reply, "But we
did not read, that discussion." There will be
greater ground for grievance in this case, for
there bas been no discussion in Parliament
of the principle on which these Orders in

285

NOVIEMBER 3, 1941
Council are based, and consequently t>he saal
merchants and dealers ail over the Dominion
have been given no opportunity te comprehend these measures. Now the Governrnent
is trying to remedy the condition by ernbodying the Orders in Council in Hansard.
I think few members -of the public read our
debates. The people rely on the papers for
ail information dealing with what takes place
'n Parliarnent, and full opportunity should
have been given for discussion of these matters both in this Ohamber and in the otiher
House. As my right honourable friend -opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says, this is the
most important measure ever dealt with by the
Government of Canada. Yet this is effected
by Order i Council on the eve of the reassembling cf Parliament. That in itself is.
bad enough, but in an attempt to bring this
legisiation by Order in Council to the notice of
the people the Government is taking the very
course which will fail to accomplish its purpose.
While it is said that ignorance of the law is
no excuse, every magistrate in the Dominion
will be toid by any person charged with infraction of the regulations contained in thîs Order
in Council that the accueed knew nothing about
them. "But," it may be retorted, "this measure
was printed in the Gazette." I arn confident
that not 10 per cent of our people receive the
Gazette, and stili fewer read' it. There is no
doubt, either, that only a very lirnited number
of people geL copies of our Parliamentary debates. The only recourse wi]l be to go to a
lawyer and ask hirn to explain the provisions~
and he may misinterpret thern. When income
tax was first irnposed the Government issued an
explanatory pamphlet containing fictitious
questions and answers. The present Goverument has also issued a book explaining the
provisions of the incorne tax law. I suggest to
the right honourable leader that the Government would have been wise to bring this
measure before Parliarnent, where the discussion of it would have involved no undue delay.
The press reports would have afforded the
people f ull opportunity to understand its mening. When the measure is put into force the
Government wiIl be confrontcd with tremendous opposition as comv.ared with what would
have been encountered had the matter been
properly and fully discussed in Parliarnent.
The supposition that the eighteen members
of the Goverument possess aIl the brains of
this country is rather a slight on the other
two hundred members of the House of Cornmous and the members of this Chamiber. It
implies that Parliament could not be entrusted
with the legisiation and therefore it had to
be passed by Order in Council on the evè' of
the assembling of Parliament. We ail want

to co-operate with the Government to carry
out its poiicy, and I assure its mem-bers that
nothing would help them so much as a full discussion in Parliament of the probierns facing
the country, for oniy in this way can the
people appreciate what legislation is necessary
to deal with those problems. The people are
not being given that opportunity. We ineet
to-night with no business on the Order Paper.
Some of us have corne huudreds, others
thousands of miles to be present. We may
not be able to match the bramas of the Goverument, but sureiy we have some rights as
representing the peopie. Parliament has been
ignored.
And what opportunity has the Governent
afforded labour to discuss this mensure? A
few representatives of labour were called in
and a slight discussion took place, but the
great body of labour had no chance whatever
to discuss it, nor were their represeutatives i
this and in the other House permitted to do so.
Those who will be affected by this measure
should have been given every opportuuity to
present their views.
1 have no objection ta the right honourabie
leader's request to place this Order in Council
on Ransard, for it will be very convenient for
us to have it on record there, but I seriously
object to the degradation of Parliament-to its
bcing treated as a mere rubber stamp. This,
1 submit, is what the passiug of Orders in
Council meaus, since there is not the slightest
reason to follow this course on the eve of the
assembling of Parliameut.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope
my honourabie friend will accept my pledge
that the Goverunent shahl sec that everyoue
is informed.

Mr. L'Espérance belonged to that enterprising and energetie class upon whoým our
English-speaking feliow-citizens .bestow the

Born at Montmýagny of an old French Canadian family, hie made an excellent course of

where lic distinguisbed himself by bis exceptional shrewdness, bis quick perception and
bis sound judgment. These remarkable quýalities brought him to. the attention of the leaders
of one of ýour great political parties, who
asked bim to take charge of their organization
in the district of Quebec. H1e had then but
one step to make to enter public ife. That
step he took in 1908 by becoming a candidate
for eleêtion to the flouse of Commons in
Montmagny, his native county. Unsuccessful
the first time, bhe took bis revenge in 1911
wben he scored a notable victory over one of
our most brilliant political men, Hon. Dr.
Béland. Ris stay in the Hýouse of Commýons
was short. In 1916 bis reputation as a
capable executive marked bim out for
appointment to the important post of chairman of the Que.bec Harbour Board. Finally,
in 1917, be was called, to this Huse, where
bis business experience, his level-beadedness
and bis thorougli gentlemanliness soýon won
bim the high appreciation and esteern of all
bis colleagues.
The performance of bis parliamentary duties
brought no interruption to bis intelligent
activities in the field of business. H1e bad
acquired there a well deserved reputation which
brougbt hlm tbhe honour of being called to
the chairmanship of important corporations
and to, the directorship of many public utility
companies. In that field lie had reacbed an
outstanding rank.

reader. Historical works, especially, exerted a
powerful attraction upon him. I have seldom
met a man who was so well informed upon
the wonderful career of Napoleon, whose mistakes are not to be condoned, but a repetitien of whose victories on European battlefields, at Austerlitz, Jena and Lutzen, we would
so eagerly desire to witness in these tragic
times. The hours thus snatched from business
that Senator L'Espérance devoted to intercourse with writers were a joy and a rest to
him.
A faithful member of this House, a
business man dedicated to numerous and
serious problems, our colleague, in spite of his
advanced age, fulfilled all bis duties with a
truly admirable competence and punctuality.
And no one among bis fellow travellers on the
highway of life could have anticipated his
startlingly sudden demise.
Once again death has struck without warning.
And it bas taught us a new lesson. We can
only abide by the sovereign decree, and express
to the families of our departed colleagues the
faithfulness of our remembrance and regret.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honourable members of the Senate, I should like to say a few
words in tribute to our departed colleagues.
The honourable senators from the Gulf (Hon.
Mr. L'Espérance) and from Stadacona (Hon.
Mr. Webster) were men whose kindly, generous dispositions, personalities and presence
we shall all miss from this Senate of ours.
They were both men who had, achieved success in the larger fields of business, industry
and finance. They brought to this House the
matured judgment and ripe experience they
had gained in those spheres, and so were able
to play a very effective, part not only in
discussing various problems in our committees, but also, as bas already been said,
on the floor of this Chamber whenever occasion arose for further discussion.
I came into even closer contact with Senator
McMeans than with the other 'honourable
gentlemen. I was one of those who for a good
many years served under bis chairmanship on
the Divorce Committee, and I am sure every
member of that committee would bear testimony to bis patience and care and firmness
in hearing and weighing ail the evidence.
And be was always careful to canvass the
opinions of and invite suggestions from every
member of that committee before deciding
a case. He was not afflicted with either a
superiority or an inferiority complex. He was
well-balanced and judicially minded, and se,
having the gifts necessary for a judge, he
made an excellent chairman of the Divorce
Committee.
Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS.

What a splendid specimen of a manly man
was Senator MeMeans! He had every attribute that anyone would associate with such
a personality; large and impressive physically,
big-hearted, broad-minded. He loved the
things of life, and plenty of them. He had
a gift for friendship, and sought the welfare
and comfort of all with whom he came in
contact.
To the relatives of the deceased senators,
we, as affectionate colleagues, wish to express
our regret and te extend our profound sympathy, knowing full well that we cannot fully
share their poignant sorrow at their irreparable loss.
These sad occurrences make us all realize
our own mortality. We assemble at the beginning of a session, all in good spirits and apparently all in good health. Then we adjourn
or prorogue for a few months and, lo I when
we return we find our ranks again depleted.
These mournful occasions bring home to us
that in a somewhat gloomy sense the poet
was right when he declared that "our hearts,
like muffled drums, are beating funeral marches
to the grave."
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I shall net say a word as to the late
Senator L'Espérance, though I loved the
man; nor of the late Senator Webster, though
I liked bis acquaintance. I do wish, however,
to pay tribute to rny late colleague from my
own city of Winnipeg.
I knew Senator McMeans for over forty
years. He was a distinguished member of the
Bar of Manitoba for many years and took an
active part in the law work of the province.
He had a happy Irish disposition, and was
quick to sense wit or pathos in a case. He was
happy in having as his life partner one of the
great women of this country, modest and
retiring, but a wonderful homemaker, and a
delight to her friends throughout the city of
Winnipeg. When in good health during the
first Great War she was the leader in all
activities to make the lot of men and women
overseas a little better by reason of the fact
that they came from Canada.
Senator
McMeans had a happy family. One boy gave
bis life at the battle of Festubert. Many
other young men from Manitoba made a
similar sacrifice, but Ernest MeMeans was a
young man of great promise, already a member of the Bar and heading towards a brilliant
career in bis favourite profession, and I know
of no casualty report that so stunned the
people of our city as the word that came
through that Captain McMeans had passed on.
Senator McMeans served as an alderman
of the city of Winnipeg, then as a member of
the Legislature of Manitoba, and, after raising

NOVEMBER 3,1941
a battalion for the first Great War, as a member of this Chamber. When I had the honour
of.being summoned here he was in his declining years, and I did not know him sa well as
a senator as when he was an alderman and a
member of the Legislative Assembly of
Manitoba.
Winnipeg will miss Lendrum MeMeans. It
was a common saying there that if he supported one side it was because he thought the
other side was going to win, and he always
wanted to help lost causes. It became the
usual thing when men were running for the
Legislature to ask, "What does MeMeans think
of our prospects?" If the reply was, "That
you are going ta be beaten," they would retort,
"Then we have a good chance of being
elected." Senator McMeans wielded a strong
and wholesome influence in our city. True,
as a legislator he was a Conservative, but he
was never a bitter partisan. From my own
association with him in the provincial Chamber I can say quite frankly that he was
beloved by all members. He had a sound
knowledge of law-a great advantage to members, because most of them are from rural
districts and have little if any knowledge of
this science.
I believe I express the views of my fellowcitizens of Manitoba when I say that it will
be many a day before we have in this or any
other House of Parliament a man so well
known by everyone as was Senator MeMeans.
And I do not believe he had a single enemy
in the whole province.
If you judge the character of our late
colleague by his family life it was high; if by
his professional and moral standing, it was
high; if by the friends he had, it was high.
Unhappily he is lost to us here, but we are
consoled by the thought that we had the
pleasure and the honour of being associated
with him for so many years.
ADJOURNMENT
On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, there was nothing on the
Order Paper when we assembled this evening,
and there will be nothing to-morrow. The
Government does not intend to bring forward
any legislation. It rests upon the work which
was done by the middle of June. It had the
House of Commons adjourn until to-day in
order ta keep Parliament in session in case of
emergency. I understand that the duration of
the present sittings of the Commons will be
fairly short. In the circumstances I shaîl
move to-morrow that when the Senate
adjourns it stand adjourned until January.
The Prime Minister bas declared that he did

289

not favour sessions overlapping from one year
to the other, and would return ta the old
practice of a session for every fiscal year.
As ta the date when we shall meet again,
there is somewhat of a difficulty in my nind.
Of course, we are free ta adjourn when we
please; we need not wait for the Commons ta
finish their discussion, whether it lasts a day
or two or three days; but if we adjourn until
early in January we may receive notice of
prorogation for the week following, and in
that event we shall have came here ta no
purpose. Sa I have decided ta move adjournment until the 21st of January next. If before
that time Parliament is convened for prorogation, the call, of course, will put an end
ta our own adjournment.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I wonder whether it did
not occur ta the right honourable gentleman
ta move that the Senate adjourn ta meet
again at the call of the Chair. An amendment of our rules enables us ta follow that
procedure now, and if we did so adjoura,
then the Chair could convene the senators
for prorogation. Of course only a certain number would attend. However, that seems ta me
a reasonable course ta pursue, and it would
enable honourable senators who sa desired to
be present for prorogation.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question came ta my mind same time ago, but
there was some objection.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I was just about
ta rise ta express the same thoughts which
have been voiced by the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Coté). If some great
crisis were ta arise between now and January
21, would it not be betterRight Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: -ta adjourn so
as ta meet again at the call of the Chair?
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. A
resolution was passed by this House whereby
in any emergency His Honour the Speaker
can recall the Senate. But there is the other
view, expressed by my honourable friend from
Ottawa East, that our resolution could be
amended sa as ta allow His Honour the
Speaker ta call us back at any time for same
special reason. I think that was discussed,
and, while I am not sure what was the result
of the discussion, I am under the impression
that there was some objection ta the Senate
divesting itself of the power of fixing its
own periods of adjournment. Our resolution
was passed with the understanding-and it
is the same tihat prevails in the House of
Commons-that in case of emergency, say

between now and January 21, or until prorogation is to take place, we may be called

is stili in force.
Right Hýon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, yes.

senators, and with the kind permission of the
right bonourable the leader of this Huse, I
desire to say a few words.
My right honourable friend will have noticed
the beautiful roses that appear on bis desk
to-day. They will be a significant reminder
to ail bonourable members of this Chamber
that this is a very important day, not only for
our rigbt honourable friend, but for this House
and the country generally. I refer to the fact
that the right honourable leader bias to-day
reached bis eigbtieth birthday.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I must lift the
veil of secrecy slightly and divulge certain
things with wbich my right honourable friend
is not familiar. bis friends in this Chamber,
and others as well, liad planued that on this
day they would give even more fitting recognition to the right bonourable gentleman's distinguisbed career than bas been given thus far.
The Prime Minister, Right bon. Mr. King,
and my leader, Right Hon. Mn. Meigben,
Cabinet members and members of the other
bouse cxpressed a desire to be presenit at tbe
fonction that we had in mind for to-day, but
oxving to the fact that both the Prime Minister
and Mn. Meighen are unable to be here to-day
to join with us in oflering congratulations and
good wishes to our gifted leader, it bias been
decided to postpone that function until early
in January.
Pcrliaps, white I amn on my feet, I mray have
your indulgence a littie white longer. It lias
beer n iiy pnivilege to know the riglit lionourable gentleman for over forty years. As al
lionourable meýmbers well know, bie lias been
a meini)er of this House, wliere hie bas served
in various capacities, for forty-two yeas--a
vcîx long timie.
And lie bias given of bis
brilliant seri'ces iot only to tlîis Chamben,
but to Canada at large, and, I might say, to
the, world, for ox er a period ;of years lie took a
pýroininent part iii the actix ities of the League
of Nations, and at one tiine held tlîe higli
Ofice of President, of its Assembly. My~ rigbt
honourable friend ibas flot devoted bis time
excliisively to parliamentary affains. A very
effltured gentleman, lie has given unstintedly
of hi., talents and time to education, art and
otlier interests, for the benefit of the city in
whlicli he and 1 reside, and of the country at
large. Casting rny memiory back, I amn unable
to recaîl any mani in public life wbo bas had
a more distinguished career ithan the rigbt
honourable leader of the Sen:ate. I know hie
wiîll he pleased to lîcar nie say that we on
this side of the bouse not only have towards
him the most friendly and cordial feelings,

NOVEMBER 4, 1941
but we recognize, equally with ail honourable
members opposite *who sit around him, the
great ahdlity that he possesses.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I sincerely
trust, sir, that you will live for many years
to corne, to enjoy the good health and vigour
that you now have. And 1 arn sure I speak
for every honourable member of this flouse
when I express the hope that you may long
continue to be its leader, for you have carried
on the duties of your office not only with
marked abîlity, but also with cordiaiity and
fairniess. My riglit honourable leader (Right
Hlon. Mr. Meighen) haîs told me ion many
occasions how much he admires you.
This is also, I think, a fitting time to
convey my congratulations Vo you on your
appointment as a member of thc King's Privy
Council, which undoubtedly is a well-deserved
honour.
May I add that I esteem it a great privilege
to have had this opportunity of expressing my
sentiments towards one whomn I hold in very
high regard.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, near.
Hon. P. E. BLONDIN (Translation): Honourable senators, may I simply add Vo the
utterances we have just heard that, in the name
of thc French Canadian members of the opposition, I whole-heartediy concur in the welldeserved tribute that has just been paid to, you,
sir, by the honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). My right bonourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will
pardon me for endeavouring, without preparation, to tell him that these words of appreciation, coming from an oid opponent who has
fought hima in days gone hy, cannot but bear
the mark of the deepest sincerity. No words of
esteemn and respect addressed to him can be
more sincere than mine. Therefore, I wish to
say Vo him that in the province of Quebec he
wiIl be remembered not only as a man who has
done good to his race, but also as an example to
French Canadian youth of moral courage, of
industry, of devotedness and of loyalty to bais
party. To-'morrow we may again find ourselves
fighting each other in defence of the principles we have always adhered to, but our right
honourable friend may be sure that, though we
may figbt against him, he remains one of those
for whom we have the greatest respect and the
deepest love.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: As a senior rnember of this Senate, I should like to have the
privilege of saying a word or two in regard
to the right honourable gentleman (Right

291

Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and tQ join with others
in congratulating him on reaching his eightieth
birthday.
It occurred to me to-day as I looked acroas
the Charnber that when, more than twentyeight years ago, I became a member, the
party of which the right honourable gentleman is now the leader in this flouse had a
mai ority of twe nty-four members. 0f the
senators of those days he is the only one left:
the others have aIl passed to their reward.
It is not neccssary for me to caîl attention
to the good qualities of my right bonourable
friend, for every member is aware of them.
I have only to say that his marked ability
and charming manneur have 'been of great
assistance to members of this Senate, and I
join them in hoping that be will for many
years continue to grace this Chamber with bis
presence.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
last evening while rny right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was paying
sincere tribute to the memory of three of our
departcd colleagues, I thougbt to-day would
give us a good opportunity of praising him,
wbile lie is in the flesh.
Some lon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Wben someone remindeil
me that this is my right honourable friend's
eightietlî birthday I could hardly believe it,
but if the date of his birth is correctly
recorded, in the Parliamentary Guide my right
honourable colleague will have to admit that
he bas reached the four-score mark. I arn
sure that, together with my honourable friends
opposite, we on this side of the flouse
appreciate very rnuch the sentiments expressed
this afternoon, of esteem and friendship for
the right honourabie leader.
W'hile Senator Dandurand is in years one of
the oidest members of this Chaýmber, in
activity and industry be is one of the
youngest.
Some lon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Every day of the session
we see birn hurrying about, attending to aIl
business which is to corne before the Senate,
and as weli keeping a friendly, watchful eye
on those in the other Chamber. We apprecdate bis industry and his friendsbip, and we
appreciate the bonour that has corne Vo him
through many years of public life. In reading
over the records of those wbo are with us now,
cîther here or in the other flouse, I do not
find any who bave filled more honourable
positions more honouraýbly than bas my right
honourable friend, Senator Dandurand.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.

SENATE

292

Hon. Mr. COPP: We all realize what his
life and his work have meant to Canada. We
realize the importance of the positions he has
held. In his occupation of those positions he
has carried on with great distinction both to
the offices lie has held and to himself. We on
this side of the House know what he has meant
to Parliament in the past, and what be means
to it to-day; and along with others, sir, I
offer my congratulations and express the hope
that you may long be spared to carry on the
work, here and elsewhere, that kind Providence
has placed upon your very able shoulders.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

I
Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
need net say, my dear friends and colleagues,
how moved I am at this appreciation of my
carcer by the members of this Chamber. It
was here that I officially entered public life
in 1898, and I may say that the greatest
pleasure I have had in life has been to find
within the walils of tiis Chamber, friends, and
friends only.
I would ask to be allowed to refer to a statement made by the Right Hon. Mr. Meighen
when the King Government was returned to
power in 1935. At that time we changed sides.
I had suggested to Mr. Meighen that I could
perhaps lead the Senate froin the other side
as well as from this side. But tradition willed
that I should sit to the right of His Honour
the Speaker, and in this Mr. Meighen agreed.
I remember that when lie rose to speak on the
Address ha said that he intended to treat the
measures I brought forward and myself as I
had treated his measures and himself-with as
much sympathy and as much of a spirit of
co-operation as I lad shown during the four or
five years lie had led the Senate. le testified
te the fact that net only in committee, but in
the Senate itself. I had joined in helping at
times to improve legislation which he brought
forward, and be expressed his intention of
reciprocating to the full.
This was, I admit, a great satisfaction to
me. All commoners whio have reached this
Chamber-the Right lion. Mr. Meighen among
them-have brought with them their own ideas
as to the functions of this Chamber, but when
my right honourable friend came to lead the
Senate he quickly learned that my prediction
was right. Upon meeting me he said, "Here is
an opponent worthy of my steel." I answered
him: "You are twice in error: first, I am net
your opponent, and, second, I am net worthy
of your steel. But you will find that the
atmosphere of the Senate does net cal for
very many clashes between the parties." There
are in the Senate, as in the country, two
trends of thought, Liberal and Conservative,
Hon. Mr. COPP.

but here we are working together to improve
legislation, and very seldom is there any
evidence of political rancour or contest."
When I came into the Chamber this afternoon I found flowers on my desk, and I have
since listened to the remarks that have been
made. For the cordiality of my honourable
friends who spoke and of those who applauded
them, I express my thanks. In the Senate it
does net take us long to find out that we are
all members of one family. When we shake
hands we feel that we belong to the same
country-that we are all Canadians.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
has disclosed that this tribute, which to my
mind would have sufficed, is to take a more
extensive form in January. A larger aggregation of friends might be somewhat formidable,
but I shall be glad to meet them and to attend
any function that may be held at that time.
Although during the last two years I have
occasionally felt that my health Nas declining, I want to say as I stand before you today that I now feel as well as I did five or
even ten years ago; so I hope Providence will
preserve me till January.
Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

The motion was agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE'
On the motion to adjourn:
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, I should like to add a few words
to what I said yesterday concerning the
adjournment we are about to take. I do this,
net for my colleagues who are within sound
of my voice, but for the country at large and
for representatives of public opinion as
expressed in the newspapers. Some persons
may be surprised that while discussion is continuing in the other House the Senate has
seen fit to adjourn until January next. I should
like them to realize that what the people
throughout the country want just now is
more and
more information concerning
Canada's effort towards winning the war.
It happens that all the key men, my colleagues at the head of the various departments carrying the burden of our war effort,
sit in the other House. It is there that they
furnish all necessary information and enlightenment, and of course it goes without saying
that first-hand information from them, given
on the floor of the Commons, where they are
surrounded by their deputies and assistants,

NOVEMBER 4, 1941
will satisfy the country far more than any
similar information I could bring second-hand
to the Senate.
This is a situation that honourable senators
May deplore, but unfortunately, even if I had
one or two of my colleagues with me, it
would not mean that those departments whieh
to-day direct the whole national effort ini this
war would be fully represented here. In
short, the country must realize that the
Senate has its limitations, and that it is only
just and proper that men who bear the responsibility should rise in their places, not in the
Senate, but in the House of Commons, to
answer any questions that may be put to
t-hem in relation to matters under their
contrai.

14879-20

SENATE

to connect the Pacifie Northwest of the United
States with Alaska by way of British Columbia
and the Yukon.
This project had been under consideration
by various official and unofficial bodies àn
Canada and the United States for some twelve
years or more, .and reports had been made by
a United States Commission in 1933 and by a
Canadian interdepartmental committee in 1938.
This latter report was not published. In 1938
representations were made to the Canadian
Government by the Government of the United
States with regard to the desirability of providing for the construction of such a highway,
and the Canadian Government was informed
that the President of the United States had
appointed a commission of five members "to
co-operate and communicate directly with any
similar agency which may be appointed in the
Dominion of Canada in a study for the survey,
location and construction of a highway to connect the Pacifie northwest part of continental
United States with British Columbia and the
Yukon Territory in the Dominion of Canada
and the Territory of Alaska."
In the spirit of these instructions to the
United States Commission by the President, the
Canadian Commission, whieh 'also consisted of
five members, was instructed by the Canadian
Government "to meet for the purpose of discussion and exchange of information with the
United States Commission appointed for that
purpose."
The Canadian Commission, which consista of
the Hon. Charles Stewart, Major-General
Thomas L. Tremblay, Mr. J. M. Wardle of the
Department of Mines and Resources, Mr. Arthur
Dixon of the Department of Public Works of
British Columbia and Mr. J. W. Spencer of
Victoria, with Mr. Stewart as chairman, held a
series of public meetings in British Columbia
and the Yukon in the summer of 1939, and,
under its direction, reconnaissance surveys were
carried out by the Dominion and provincial
engineers, both by air and on the ground.
The substance of these hearings and surveys
was communicated to the Government in a
preliminary report in April, 1940. The Commission at that time felt that further ground
work by engineers would be necessary before
it would be in a position to give a reasoned
opinion on the respective merits of different
routes that had been proposed for a highway.
These additional surveys were carried out in
the summer of 1940, and when the reports of
the engineers had been received the Commission
proceeded te consider and digest all the available information. It also, in accordance with
the instructions of the Order in Council, held
meetings from time to time with the members
of the United States Commission, and discussed
with them varions problems arising out of their
respective investigations.
The Commission, having completed its investigation and deliberations, prepared for the
information of the Government of Canada the
very compreiensive report which has now been
tabled. This report, after surveying the results
of previous inquiries, and summarizing the
evidence obtained at the public hearings,
describes in detail the varions routes investigated by the Commission, and analyses the
information collected on the natural resources
of the regions traversed by various proposed
routes, the character of the country, its climate,
snowfall, and so forth.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The Commission has embodied in its report
a great deal of relevant data, including estimates of costs. The Commission itself reports
that either of the two main routes investigated,
known as the "A" and "B" routes, is practicable
from an engineering point of view. It is understood that the United States Commission concurs in this conclusion.
These routes, the former nearer the ses and
the latter nearer the mountains, are shown on
the map accompanying the Commission's report.
The "A" route runs roughly from the vicinity
of Fort St. James, in northern British Columbia,
and by way of Atlin, near the British ColumbiaYukon border, to Whitehorse, and from there
to the Alaskan boundary. The "B" route, from
Prince George, extends north through what is
known as the Rocky Mountain Trench to Liard
River and down the valley of the Pelly to the
Yukon and from there to Dawson and the
Alaskan boundary.
The Commission, after
balancing the advantages and disadvantages of
each route, concludes that the "B" route would
best fufil the purposes of the proposed highway.
In its consideration of the proposed highway
the Commission has assumed that the existing
roads of British Columbia from the international boundary north to Prince George and
Fort St. James would form part of the highway,
whatever route might be adopted, and confines
its consideration of these existing roads to an
estimate of the cost of bringing them up te
the suggested standard of the highway.
The Commission finds that the length of the
highway from Vancouver to the Alaskan
boundary would vary from about 1,700 miles
to about 1,900 miles, according to the route
adopted.
The Commission estimates the cost of a highway completed to the required standard, but
exclusive of paving, at from $25,000,000 to
$30,000,000, but as these figures are based upon
reconnaissance surveys they are only approximate.
The "B" route would be somewhat
shorter than the "A" route and would cost less
both to construct and to maintain.
The Commission expresses its appreciation of
the cordial co-operation of the Government of
British Columbia in placing all relevant maps
and engineering data at its disposal and in
authorizing at considerable expense additional
field surveys by its engineers.

PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
SPEECH FROM TEE THRONE

The Right Honourable Sir Lyman Poore
Duff, the Deputy of the Governor General,

JANUARY 21, 1942
having come and being seated at the foot of
theè Throne, and the House of Commons being
come with their Speaker, the Right Honourable the Deputy of the Governor General was
pleased to close the Second Session of the
Nineteenth Parliament of the Dominion of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Since the present session opened, we have
witnessed the extension of war until, to-day,
it encompasses the globe. As aggression has
succeeded aggression, the active resistance of
free peoples everywhere has risen to meet it.
The myth of national isolation has vanished
from the earth. It is now recognized that the
freedom of each nation is bound up in the
freedom of all.
A little more than a year ago, the countries
of the British Commonwealth stood virtualy
alone, except for China, in armed resistance to
the forces seeking domination of the world.
In the front line of freedom were the brave
people of Britain. Most of the countries of
Europe lay at the feet of the conqueror. The
heroic resistance of the peoples of Yugoslavia
and Greece, the entry as an ally into the war
of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the
determination and military might of the armed
forces of the Soviet Union, and the achievements of the British and Allied forces in Africa
have materiallly changed the outlook of Europe.
A new and very critical situation has been
created by Japanese aggression in the Far East
and by the declaration of war by Japan against
the United States, the British Commonwealth
and the Netherlands. Germany and Italy have
jined Japan in declaring war against the
United States. In assessing the possible consequences of Japan's action, full account should
be taken of the significance of the entry of the
United States into war against the combined
Axis Powers.
In Canada, within recent weeks, the world
aspect of the conflict has been reflected by
formal declarations of the existence of a state
of war between Canada and Japan, and shortly
before, by similar declarations against Hungary
Rumania, and Finland, whose Governments had
passed completeily under Nazi domination.
Canada's action in this respect was a part of
the solidarity which now embraces the war effort
of all the Allies.
In Britain, in the Far East, in the skies over
Europe and over Africa, and on all the seven
seas, Canada's fighting men. are upholding freedom. Hostilities in the Pacifie have added te
our problems and responsibilities. Already, by
their heroie participation in the defence of the
island fortress of Hong Kong, Canadian troops
have written an immortal chapter of Canadian
valour.
The whole economy of Canada has been
increasingly directed to meet the needs of war.
There has been a steady and orderily mobilization of material resources and of men and
women for the widely varied tasks of modern
total war.

14879-201

295

Additional precautions have been taken for
civil defence.
Further provision has been made for the
dependents of members of the armed forces.
Reciprocity in the war production of Canada
and the United States was established as a
result of the agreement reached at Hyde Park
in April last. The war production of the two
countries has been further inereased by subsequent joint agreements.
Compreheusive and drastie measures have
been taken te control the cost of living and
to prevent inflation.
My Government has maintained close association with His Majesty's Governments in
Britain and other parts of the British Commonwealth, and with those of the Allied powers.
My Prime Minister and several of my Ministers
have visited the United Kingdom for consultation and conference. The Prime Minister
of Great Britain, the Prime Ministers of
Australia and New Zeaßand, other Ministers
from different parts of the Commonwealth, and
distinguished representatives of the Allied
Governments have also visited Canada. These
personal exchanges have heartened and strengthened our common effort.
Of particular significance have been the meeting at sea and the conferences held at Washington between the Prime Minister of Great
Britain and the President of the United States,
and the visit to Canada of the Prime Minister
of Great Britain. In these conferences, my
Prime Minister and other of my Ministers have
been both directly and indirectly associated.
The Atlantic Charter agreed upon between the
President of the United States and the Prime
Minister of Great Britain has been approved
by all the Allied nations. It sets forth underlying principles of a new world order upon
which all are agreed.
An outcome of the
conferences at Washington was the important
declaration si ged at Washington, at the
beginning of the present year, by the representatives of twenty-six nations. It binds each
of the several countries te employ all of its
resources against the Axis Powers, and not to
conclude a separate armistice or peace.
In the course of the present session, the
people of Canada learned with regret of the
death of two former Governors General. The
names of His Royal Highness the Duke of
Connaught and the Marquess of Willingdon will
remain outstanding among those of the distinguished representatives, in Canada, of His
Majesty the King.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the financial appropriations
you have made. Their unprecedented magnitude
is but one of many evidences of the determination of the Canadian people to put forth their
utmost effort in the winning of the war.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I devoutly join with you in invoking the aid
of Divine Providence in the preservation of
our Christian civilization.
