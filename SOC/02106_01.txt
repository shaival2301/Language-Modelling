that the Senate might wish ta refer ta the

desirable ta have that committee in being.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Han. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
in order to follow a precedent set the last
time a reigning British sovereign died, I
suggest that we confine ourselves this evening
to the disposai of the two motions which
appear on our Order Paper. Tomarrow we
can proceed with the speeches by the mover
and seconder of the Address in reply ta the
Speech from the Throne. On Thursday, the
Senate can pay tribute to the memory of Our
two late colleagues, and consider certain
legisiatian now before the other house, which
in ail probability will be sent to us between
now and Thursday.
I also, want ta suggest to honourable
senators that between now and Easter, which
is about six weeks hence, the Senate sit on
Tuesday nights and Wednesday and Thursday
afternoons, unless from time to time it is
deemed advisable ta do otherwise. This will
give the Divorce Committee, or any other
committee that may be sitting, ample
opportunity to concentrate on its work in
the early and latter parts of the week.

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable
the acting leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Aseltine):
Resolved. That an Humble Address be presented
ta Her Majesty the Queen in the foflowing words:

To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty:.
Most Graciaus Sovereign:
We. Your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects the
Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled, respectfully destre, ta express aur deep sympathy ta Your

SENATE
Majesty in the great loss you have sustained by the
death of the late King, Your Majesty's beloved
father.
Ycur Majesty's sorrow and that of the Royal
Family is shared in a personal way by the people
of Canada, whose representatives we are. King
George VI was a great king and a good man. By
his devotion to duty, his high courage, his example
as a husband and a father, and his concern for the
welfare of those he ruled, he greatly endeared himself to his Canadian subjects. We will not forget
the occasion when, accompanied by your beloved
mother he visited our country, nor will Canadians
forget the many happy associations established in
the course of his reign over us. In common with
all the peoples of the commonwealth, we shall ever
deeply cherish his memory.
We welcome Your Majesty's accession to the
Throne and we desire to convey to you a sincere
expression of our loyalty and devotion. When Your
Majesty, accompanied by your husband, visited us
a few months ago, you left a deep and lasting
impression upon the Canadian people. We are convinced that Your Majesty will ever seek to promote
the happiness and well-being of all your subjects.
As members of the Parliament of Canada, it is our
desire and determination to uphold and support
Your Majesty to the utmost of our authority and
wisdom, and it is our prayer that Divine Providence
will sustain Your Majesty in the discharge of your
heavy responsibilities.
Honourable senators, I would also move,
seconded by the Honourable the acting leader
opposite, the following resolution:
Resolved, That a message of condolence be sent
to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother
in the following words:
Your Gracicus Majesty:
We, the Senate of Canada, in parliament assembled, respectfully beg leave ta tender to Your
Majesty our heartfelt sympathy in your great sorrow and bereavement. We share Your Majesty's
grief and loss in the passing of our late sovereign,
King George VI, who was greatly beloved by all his
subjects.
We pray tliat, at this time, Your Majesty may be
comforted and sustained by the remembrance of
what your loving companionship meant to the late
king throughout his life and reign: by memories of
service sýhared; and by the sympathy and love that
everywhere surrounds Your Majesty in your great
sorrow.

Honourable senators, I am sure that it
would be the unanimous wish of honourable
senators that we should take this the first
opportunity of formally recording our deep
sorrow at the passing of our beloved sovereign
King George VI, of expressing our deepest
sympathy to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,
Her Majesty the Queen Mother and the members of the Royal Family, in the grievous loss
which they have just sustained, and of conveying ta our young Queen, as she assumes
the great responsibilities incidental to her
high office, our sincerest expressions of
loyalty and devotion.
Down through the centuries the cry of
the heralds "The King is dead! Long live the
King!" has epitomized the nation's regret and
sorrow at the passing of a sovereign, coupled
with good wishes and fervent hopes for the

future. At no time has it been more applicable
than at present, for our late sovereign,
through his qualities of mind and heart,
endeared himself to his subjects to an excep-

tional degree; and as our young Queen
ascends the throne a flood of emotion is
unloosed, striking the imagination and stirring
the hearts of countless millions of ber subjects, who in varied and divers manners owe

her constitutional or spontaneous allegiance.
Under our constitutional procedure the
Crown exercises a profound influence on the
minds and hearts of all. Should the sovereign
possess great qualities of mind and tact,
,as did our late sovereign, he may exercise
a far greater influence on matters of state
than most of us are given ta realize. But it
is, I believe, the qualities of heart that exercise the greatest influence. We still remember
the pride we felt when, during the last war,
King George VI, urged ta seek safety elsewhere when death and destruction were raining from the skies, elected ta stay with his
people, sharing their fears, griefs, and dangers.
We were proud of his private life, when,

surrounded by his family, he gave an example
of all that is best in family life. Though he
walked with kings, he did not lose the common
touch. An African chieftain, on meeting him,
exclaimed: "Other white men talk ta me as
a coloured man; you talk ta me as a white
man."

And lastly, he possessed a deep religious
conviction, in troubled times ever turning ta
the Almighty for consolation and support.
It is said that when he suddenly found himself confronted with the responsibility of
kingship, he went alone ta one of Britain's

historic chapels and there on bended knee
prayed for strength and guidance.
Some time during the dark hours of the
evening of February 5 and the early morning
of February 6 his saul passed ta his Maker. It
is not given ta us ta know whether during
those dark hours he slept peacefully on, or
whether for a brief moment be may have
regained consciousness. In any event there
comes back ta our minds a quotation he used
in his Christmas message ta his people during
Britain's darkest hours:
And I said to the man who stood at the gate of
the year, "Give me a light that I may tread safely
into the unknown."
And he replied,
"Go out into the darkness and put your hand
into the Hand of God. That shal be to you better
than a light and safer than a known way."
So I went forth, and finding the Hand of God,
trod gladly into the unknown.

A few days later a million people stood
silently to witness the funeral procession
through London, the stillness broken only by
the cadence of marching feet. In St. George's
Chapel-at Windsor, the ancestral home of

MARCH 4, 1952
English kings for 850 years-the young Queen
scattered symbolic earth on the coffin as it
was lowered into the crypt, and the king was
laid to rest amid the tombs of his fathers. The
life and times of George VI were English
history, whose unending scroll will now
record the story of Queen Elizabeth IL.
The next day, the half-staffed flags were
run up to full staff, and while custom decrees
a period of mourning, the thoughts of all
turned from the past to the future.
It is true to say that in these trying times
in world affairs, all the peoples of the Commonwealth, and indeed of the world itself,
have much to hope for. But in no part of the
Commonwealth are minds of men turned as
eagerly in search of a portent of better times
as in the United Kingdom-those sea-girt
islands of the North Atlantic.
It is difficult for us who live in this blessed
land, so far removed from the direct and
indirect effects of war, to realize the flood
of emotions let loose by the accession of a
queen to the throne, for another of those
rare occasions in the lorfg history of Britain.
With ourselves, the people of the United
Kingdom welcomed the relief that accompanied the end of hostilities in 1945. But
their elation at the relief from the terror
that rained from the skies was quickly followed by the grim realization that such had
been their sacrifice of blood and treasure that
years must elapse as they slowly and steadily
climbed back to normal times. Then, as
happier times seemed almost within reach,
came Korea and the realization that again
the hands of the economic clock were to be
pushed back, perhaps for the lifetime of most
of those then living. What more natural
for a people steeped in the tradition of a
long and glorious past than to let their
minds turn back to the reign of the first
Elizabeth, when danger of invasion was ended
for generations to come, and to the times of
Victoria, who ascended the throne during a
period of great economic distress, but during whose reign their developed a period of
fabulous growth and development of everything that contributes to the welfare and happiness of mankind. Surely it is easy to realise
the readiness of those who are searching the
skies for a sign, to hall the accession to the
throne of Elizabeth Il as a portent of happier
times.
Apart altogether from this hope, there is
the additional factor that in the person of
our new sovereign there is much to give
promise that she will worthily follow the
long line of her distinguished predecessors.
Schooled in the tradition of royalty, to the
high office she has assumed, she brings in
abundant degree all of those characteristics

that- endeared her late father to his subjects.
That she is destined to exercise a profound
influence upon all her subjects in the Commonwealth, we who have so recently seen
her will be the first to agree. We will not
soon forget the stirring pledge she made on
her twenty-first birthday, when she said: "I
declare before you all that my whole life
shall be devoted to your service and the
service of our great Imperial family, to which
we all belong." To the Accession Council she
affirmed that she would always work, as her
father did throughout his reign, to uphold
constitutional government and advance the
happiness and prosperity of her peoples.
These are the words of one fully conscious
not merely of her destiny, but of the great
and heavy responsibilities accompanying it.
But who can tell what influence for good
she may be able to exercise far beyond the
borders of the Commonwealth? No one could
fail to be impressed by the reception she
received from the peoples of the great
republic to the south, during her all-too-brief
visit there. The spontaneous and genuine
kindliness of her reception by a people, the
majority of whom are kinsmen of her own
people, reminds one of the exclamation of
the American poet Whittier in reference to
Queen Victoria: "We bow the heart, if not
the knee, to England's Queen; God bless
her."
It is not given to us to be able to peer
very far into the future, but we can express
to Her Majesty our loyalty and devotion,
and assure her that it is our desire and
determination to uphold her and support her
to the utmost of our authority and wisdom,
and pray that Divine Providence will sustain
her in the discharge of her great responsibilities.
Perhaps we too in this portion of the
Commonwealth may be pardoned if we as
well hope that the accession to the throne of
Elizabeth II is a sign that in due course swords
will be beaten into ploughshares and the
rivalry of nations will be confined to their
efforts in raising the standard of welfare and
happiness of their respective peoples. Pray
God it may be so!
And so we join with the heralds of the
past in proclaiming "The King is dead! Long
live the Queen!"
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: My remarks, honourable senators, will be brief. The leader of
the government has given us a very interesting resumé of what took place during the
reign of our late King; and with the sentiments he has expressed this evening I think
all members of the Senate entirely agree.
These two motions, the first being an
address of sympathy with and of loyalty to

If I have lingered on that unforgettable

his lot the late King ever revealed himself
more and more worthy of the respect and
affection sbown him. Wbat tragic destiny was
his, in truth. The most disastrous world war
awaited George VI upon his return to bis
capital. His gallant armies, sent out to support France and Belgium, were thrown back
to Dunkirk, under the blows o! an enemy long
prepared for inhuman warfare. His islands,
so dearly beloved and baving ties in every
port o! the world, were for montbs tbreatened
by an invasion mercilessly prepared for by
incessant bombings. At a time when stately
buildings crumbled around hlmi and when his
own residence became a military objective,
the King refused to leave his post. He faced
death among bis own people with a tranquil
courage wbich impressed the wbole world and
increased the prestige of the crown. During
several years, he had sorrowfully witnessed
the death on the battleflelds of the flower of
his people. Following a victory won at such
cost, fate ordained that the Empire over which
he reigned, an empire which had grown
through centuries of constant effort, should
be subjected to one of those inevitable transformations whicb happen so suddenly, as
though by contagion, in the bistory of great
states and of the human race.
Before the quickened pace of events which
seemed to shape a destiny, thîs most wise and
worthy King, who carried without ostentation
the title o! Emperor, bowed with the submission o! a well tempered spirit, and
accepted in silence the lot which feU
to hlm. It was this noble attitude which gave
so mucb value to bis life. It is not by his

words that he will be remembered, but
rather by his example, by his strength of character. He was able to stand adversity without
bitterness.
George VI passes down into history as an
essentîally virtuous and sincerely religious
man; one who had a deep family spirit, who
was f aitbful to his state duties, even unto
self denial, who was profoundly buman in the
exercise of kingship and bumbly submissive
ta the decrees of a fathomless Providence. He
bas covered the most eminent post with glory
because he neyer sought tbat glory for himself. The mystery of death fourni bim fearless. As Winston Churchill s0 aptly expressed
it: "He fell asleep like a man who lived in
the fear of God and nothing else."
It is fitting that the Senate should render
bomage to a King who showed such moral
fibre, whose wbole life was a symbol o! the
qualities and vîrtues upon which rest the
bigbest Britisb traditions, and who in the ages
to come will be offered as a model to constitutional sovereigns.
In recently favouring our country with a
visit, a graclous Princess, accompanied by ber
husband tbe distinguished Duke of Edinburgh,
allowed us to ascertain in the dýignity of ber
bearing, in the generosity of ber nature and
the interest she takes in all classes of the
community, the extent to wbicb she bas
fallen heir to the great qualities of ber
lamented father. Her Majesty Elizabeth II,
wbom Canada is proud to have been the first
country o! the Commonwealth to recognize
as its sovereign, grew up in a most sorely
tried generation,. She bas experienced and
understood the responsibilities o! Royalty in
connection with social, national and international problems. Such an experience went
too deep not to exercise a constant influence
upon ber. Her mind is already impregnated
and enriched by it.
History testifies that although the periods
when the tbrone o! England bas been occupied
by a Queen have not been without difficulty
and trouble, they have also known days of
particular glory. One only needs to recaîl the
marvellous role played not so, long ago by the
admirable Queen Victoria, who gave sucb
impetus in Great Britain to, tbe development
of the letters, arts and sciences as well as to
the economic and commercial 11f e of the
country. It is to this line of women that
Elizabeth II belongs, and she will no doubt
hearken to the voice of ber predecessors fromn
the Great Beyond.
Therefore, it is witb confidence that our
hopes will come true that we extend to Her
Mai esty Elizabeth II tbe wish that she may
have a long and useful reign, during wbicb

ADDRESS

IN

REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the Sixtb Session
of the Twenty-first Parliament of Canada.
Han. J. P. Howden moved:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, Member of the Order of the Companions of
Honour, Governor General and Commander-inChie£ of Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects. the Senate of Canada. in parliament assembled. beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your
Excellency for the gracious speech which Your
Excellency bas addressed to both houses of parliament.

He said: Honourable senators, being an old
member of the Senate I know f ull weil that
it is against the ruies for honourable senators
to read speeches. I toyed briefly with the
idea of discarding the text of my remarks,
but that was onhy a pipe-dream, for I reaiized
f ull well that I could not get on without the
text-and more, that I wouhd have to follow
it pretty closely if I were to make my
remarks sensible. So if it appears at times
that I am speaking to the wall or reading
to myseif, you will know the reason why,
and I hope you will make allowances.
I have flot tbe rernotest idea wbat circumstance bas placed me before you today to

move the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, but in the light of recent sad
and sombre events one might well have wished
for a happier task. Indeed, we at the capital,
and more especially in this chamber, have of
late had occasion for much regret. It commenced witb the officiai farewell to Viscount
His
Alexander and his gracious Lady.
Excellency's f ame preceded bim to Canada,
and their coming was anticipated with much
pleasure. Nor were Canadians disappointed,
for the popularity of Lord Alexander and
his family grew f rom the first day on. Now
to our regret they were going away; many
wished they might have stayed longer or
might come amongst us again at a future
time. We bade themn good-bye officially on
the night of February 5, and the next morning
early we were stunned witb the awfui news
of the death of our King.
This was no cause for mild regret. I
believe that profound sorrow seized the
whole British people, and that thousands and
hundreds of tbousands of people in ahl the
Commonwealth mourned deeply and stili do.
A sincere conscientious, tboughtful person,
gracious, kindly, humble and grand, the late
King would, I believe, have been well content
to pass on the Crown to another had he not
feit it bis sacred duty to take it up. Nor
was it easy for himn at that; it presented many
problems-problems with which, perhaps, like
Jacob of old, he often wrestled far into the
night until, like Jacob, he too prevailed. He
overcame, and to hlm that overcometh a
crown of life shahl be. I believe that no
finer man than King George VI ever sat
on the Tbrone of Great Britain. Our deep,
kindly sympathy goes to bis sorrowing wife,
and to bis mother and daughters, for surely no
one in like circumstances was ever better
loved or more deephy mourned than be.
Within the last few days two of our most
warmly regarded senators have passed on.
I believe the officiai eulogy has been delayed
necessarily till a later date, but I feel that
these remarks would be sadly lacking if no
expression of appreciation were made at this
time of the hives of these splendid men. Both
were old men, both famous in their fields
of endeavour.
Senator Thomas Bourque, from New Brunswick, appointed in 1917, was the senior
inember of the Senate. A physician and
surgeon by profession, he beld as well an
M. A. degree, and had maintained a private
semi-rural practice for nearly sixty yearsno small task, I am sure. Our sympathy is
with the bereaved family in the loss of this
fine old gentleman.
Sir Allen Aylesworth was almost a centenarian, having been born in 1854. He

SENATE

occupied third place in Senate seniority at
the time of his death. A man of outstanding
legal eminence, he was one of His Majesty's
Commissioners for the settlement of the
Alaskan Boundary in 1903. He was elected
to parliament in 1905; became Postmaster
General and Minister of Labour at once, and
Minister of Justice in 1906. He retired from
parliament with the defeat of the Laurier
administration in 1911. He was created
Knight in 1911, and summoned to the Senate
in 1923. We shall miss this grand old man
from this chamber, and will always think
of him with pleasant, kindly remembrance.
Since the King's death, his elder daughter
has become our Queen. Only a few short
months ago, she with her young husband,
paid us a joyful visit in all parts of Canada.
Wherever they went they gladdened the
hearts of Canadians-and they said that
Canadians gladdened their hearts too. We
all liked our young Princess and ber dashing,
stalwart young consort with a warmth of
regard verging on love, and we now grieve
with her in her deep sorrow in the loss of that
fine man, her father. There shall never be
any question of our loyalty to her. So long
as she displays towards us the same kindly
friendship that was in evidence during her
visit with us, we will eagerly stand by her
to the last ditch and to the last man.
This chamber was the scene of a great
historical occasion a few days ago, when
the first Canadian to hold that office was
installed as Governor General. It was something of which I think we should all be
proud. It is a sign of "growing up" and
putting on the garments of nationhood. I
think it is the idlest of talk to say that this
constitutional departure, which every other
nation in the commonwealth had previously
made, tends in any way to weaken the ties
with the Crown. It did not so do in
Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, nor
will it here. On the contrary, I feel the ties
will be stronger and more intimate.
In the new Governor General we have
a distinguished diplomat of wide experience,
who knows full well the duties, privileges
and prerogatives of his position. His choice
met the ready approval of the late King
who knew Mr. Massey well and was happy to
confer upon him this exceptional eminence.
When the time had come to have a Canadian
Governor General, a better choice could not
have been made.
The world situation continues to cause
concern, to be sure, as stated in the Speech
from the Throne, and well it may. The war
in Korea alone has been raging for the past
two and a half years, and we seem to be
little nearer the finish than when we started.

Thousands of fine young men on both sides
of the conflict have been destroyed, and
untold suffering has overtaken the people in
the sphere of hostilities. And why? Is it
because one nation seeks to force a false
ideology upon the rest of the world? I think
not, because already that nation of itself has
forsaken that ideology. Is it because, as
with Caesar and Alexander the Great, one
nation seeks world conquest? Well, that may
be, but there is another very potent force
constantly at play. Maybe I am "sticking my
neck out", but I believe that over-population
has been the underlying irritant that has set
the war gods going in most of our troubles
in the last half century. Jealousy in an overcrowded South African republic started
things frying there in 1899. Overcrowded
Germany burst ber bonds in 1914, and the
same was true of Italy and Japan in 1939.
I believe that we face the same thing today
in Eastern Europe, but in a somewhat different way, perhaps. No doubt Eastern Europe
is envious of the great American progress
and the superiority of American industry,
American machinery, American agriculture
and American land. There seems to be nothing we can do about it-well, not much at
present, but try our best to relieve the distress of starving Chinese, starving Indians,
starving Japanese, and perhaps starving
Russians. This will not help much, for still
they come; but by painless and harmless
means the birth-rate could be controlled, and
when countries can furnish their own people
with food there will be fewer wars. Prime
Minister Nehru of India is reported to have
said that birth control is the only solution
for India's over-population.
Redistribution of seats in the House of
Commons is not a matter of direct concern
to this chamber. Nevertheless, the subject is
of general interest and importance. It comes
about every ten years, subsequent to the
decennial census. In proportion to their gains
or losses in population, the different provinces lose or gain seats in the House of Commons, and this necessitates some change in
allotment. No difficulty should be experienced
in applying in a fair and equitable manner
the new unit of representation. I feel sure
that will be done through the co-operation of
all parties.
We will be asked to ratify the Japanese
Peace Treaty. The more such treaties we
have, the greater will be the prospective
calm and stability in this much troubled
world. It is true that Japan entered into
the last war in an act of treachery, but she
paid the price. She was completely vanquished. Against any resurgence of her
militarisn the treaty provides adequate
safeguards. It may even well be that this

SENATE
Honourable senators, Canada has now
attained its maturity. As an international
power, our country is called upon to meet
increasingly heavy obligations to maintain or
restore peace and to ensure its own security.
As mentioned in the speech from the throne,
the nations of the free world must continue
to increase their combined strength, for that
seems to be the most effective way to deter
aggression. To the Canadian troops fighting
heroically in Korea, we owe not only our
moral support, but also the reinforcements
and additional equipment which may be
required. In order to push back communist
aggression in Korea and to defend our own
country, in order to carry out our commitments under the United Nations Charter as
well as under the North Atlantic Treaty, we
will be called upon, d-uring the present session,
to approve expenditures amounting, it seems,
to some two billion dollars. We will no doubt
be shown the urgency of spending such enormous sums. This armaments race, however
inevitable it may be, is threatening to bring
taxes to an intolerable level. Such a situation
hinders the development of our resources and
may eventu-ally prevent us from playing a
greater part in the building up of underdeveloped countries. According to the speech
from the throne, it is true, we will be asked
to approve a further contribution to the
Colombo plan. Even though our expenses
are already so high, it is fitting that we should
do our equitable share to h.elp in this way
the asiatic people. Such positive and beneficial
action is likely to check the spread of communism. To prevent Asia from siding with
Moscow, we must put a halt to famine and
to the exploitation of the natives destitution:
it is better to win hearts than to wage wars.
The more friends Canada will have among
the nations of the world, the more chances
for peace to be restored and maintained.
Instead of destroying, let us seek to build,
for even though we must prepare for war, we
must not neglect to prepare for peace. Science
has given us the atomic bomb, but it has
also, thank heaven, furnished us with marvellous instruments of peaceful co-operation. Our
international radio broadcasting service, for
instance, is in a position to endear us to
millions of foreign listeners. By means of the
air waves, we can enter into the farthest lands,
so that they may know and corne to appreciate Canada, and so that we may win the
confidence and affection of these far-off
people. It is no mean task to secure such

a capital of good will. Our prime minister
has grasped both the importance and the
difficulties of this problem.
In order to
reorganize the international radio-broadcasting service of the C.B.C., he has deemed it
necessary to call upon one of our most
prominent diplomats one whose career has
been an uninterrupted series of successes,
whether in Paris, Brussells, The Hague, Rio,
or Rome. I am speaking of His Excellency
Ambassador Jean Desy. Because of his deep
knowledge of foreign affairs and of the European as well as the South American mentalities, because of the experience which he has
acquired in the most varied spheres, because
of his love of art in all its forms and his
undeniable culture, our ambassador was the
ideal and only candidate.
For this happy choice, I wish to congratulate our Prime Minister and his government.
I also wish to congratulate His Excellency
for having been willing, while remaining
with our diplomatic service and while maintaining his seniority and his rank, to temporarily give up his ordinary functions as
an ambassador, to become our Minister Plenipotentiary of the air waves and of the international broadcasting service. This special
mission implies m'any sacrifices and it is
indeed a difficult task. But, thanks to His
'Excellency Jean Desy, the voice of Canada
will carry its message of peace into the most
remote parts of the world.
It was a great honour for His Excellency
to represent Canada abroad. He is now rendering a great service to our country in
acting as its spokesman. He will no doubt
deserve our gratitude for this new role he
has accepted to play.
Personally, I attach great importance to
this appointment and I am pleased to give
my full approval to that step taken by the
Government.
I also take pleasure in
requesting you to support its general policy
by voting in favour of the motion I have
just seconded.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), I move adjournment of the
debate until Tuesday next.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 7, an Act for the control and extirpation of Foot and Mouth
Disease.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, I would move that this bill be placed
on the order paper, to be considered later
this day.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Why not "the four
Atlantic provinces"?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Well, "the four Atlantic
provinces" might be quite proper, though it
is not a term that has been in ordinary use.
The term "the Maritime provinces" has been
traditionally and historically -applied to the
three provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. If that term
were adopted to include Newfoundland it
might, and I think it would, cause confusion
on the mainland and in the province of Newfoundland as well. The honourable gentleman who has given notice of the inquiry is
a native of Newfoundland and a good friend
of the people of that province, and my point
in making this suggestion is simply to avoid
confusion.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I have no objection to the
suggested change.

If the government can prevent interprovincial

of confederation contained in the British North

of 'that principle that I introduced Bill B

THE LATE SENATORS AYLESWORTH
AND BOURQUE
TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, it is my unhappy duty to officially
report to the house the passing, since we
last met, of two of our senior colleagues.
The Honourable Sir Allen Bristol Aylesworth,
Q.C., K.C.M.G., the oldest member of this
honourable body, died at his home in Toronto
on February 13, and the Honourable Thomas
J. Bourque, who at the time of his death
enjoyed the distinction of being the dean of
the Senate in point of seniority of appointment,
passed away at his home in Richibucto, New
Brunswick on February 16.
Senator Aylesworth was born in 1854
He
of United Empire Loyalist stock.
was educated at the University of Tohis M. A.
ronto, where he received
degree in 1875. At the time of his
death he was the university's oldest living
graduate. He was called to the Ontario Bar
in 1878, and was created a Queen's Counsel
for the province in 1889, and for the Dominion
of Canada in 1890. He was a Bencher of
the Law Society of Upper Canada continuously
from 1891 to the time of his death, and
practised law with the same firm in Toronto
for half a century prior to his retirement
from this field in 1924. At the time of his
death be was the senior member of the
Queen's Privy Council for Canada.
Sir Allen's notable career of public service
commenced in 1903, when he was one of
His Majesty's Commissioners for settlement
He represented
of the Alaska Boundary.
Canada and Britain, as agent, before the
Hague Tribunal in the Fisheries Arbitration
in 1910, and was a delegate to Washington
with reference to the Hague Tribunal Award
in 1911. In January of that year he was created
a K.C.M.G. in recognition of his services in
connection with the fisheries arbitration.
Senator Aylesworth was elected to the
House of Commons for North York in 1905.
He was appointed Postmaster General and

Minister of Labour in the Laurier cabinet
in October 1905, and became Minister of
Justice in June of the following year. In the
general election of 1908 be was re-elected;
but in 1911, owing to increasing physical
disabilities, he did not run. Sir Allen was
called to the Upper Chamber on January 11,
1923 as representative of the district of North
York.
For the first three years after I was
appointed to the Senate, Sir Allen, though
grievously handicapped by deafness, displayed an amazing ability of keeping in
touch with every important question that
was before this house. He regularly attended
sittings of the Senate and the committees,
and took the keenest interest in everything
under discussion. Needless to say because of
his long experience and great abilities, any
views that he expressed commanded the
greatest attention and respect. Though for
the last year or two his infirmity resulted
in his less frequent attendance at the sittings
of this house, he will long be remembered
as one of the most able and distinguished of
our colleagues.
Senator Bourque was born at Memramcook, New Brunswick, of Acadian stock, in
1864, and was the last member of this chamber who was born in pre-Confederation days.
He received his education at St. Joseph's
County, New
University, Westmoreland
Brunswick, and had practised his profession
as physician and surgeon in Richibucto, New
Brunswick, since 1889.
Our late colleague was first elected to the
New Brunswick legislature in 1908, and was
re-elected in 1912. He was summoned to the
Senate in 1917, and was thus for some years
dean of this honourable body in seniority, as
be was for a brief period in age. To our late
esteemed colleague's three daughters we
extend our deepest sympathy.
When I first assumed the responsibility of
government leadership in this house, Senator
Bourque was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Health and Welfare, over
which be presided with his customary courtesy and ability. It was my good fortune to
have the honour of nominating him for several
years afterwards, until he voluntarily relinquished the position feeling that he was no
longer able to do justice to it.
As an outstanding representative of the
Acadians of the Maritime Province, Senator
Bourque's long life of usefulness entitles him
to lasting remembrance among all those with
whom he was associated.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I think we all agree with the remarks made
by the honourable leader of this chamber

MARCH 6, 1952
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) with regard to the two
senators who have so recently departed this
life. I also wish to make a few remarks
with respect to each of them; first, the late
Sir Allen Aylesworth, K.C.M.G.
We on this side of the chamber have always
had a very high regard for our deceased
colleague Sir Allen Aylesworth. Sir Allen
was one of the first senators to welcome me
when, as a new senator, I came into this
chamber in 1934; and I flatter myself that I
enjoyed.his friendly interest from then right
to the time of his death. I well remember
that the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen,
when leader of the government in the
Senate, regarded Sir Allen's ability so highly
that he frequently requested him to prepare
and present to the house briefs on complicated
matters and problems which required the
application of a keen legal mind. Sir Allen
always complied with such requests, and
made numerous speeches on subjects studied
by him. I well remember listening to him
on those occasions.
He was born, not in Ontario but in Upper
Canada, nearly one hundred years ago, and
he knew and was well acquainted with all
of the Prime Ministers since Confederation,
beginning with Sir John A. Macdonald and
including all occupants of that office to the
present time. As bas been stated by the
leader of the government, he was a very
brilliant student. At twenty years of age
he was given the degree of Bachelor of Arts,
and at twenty-one he obtained his Master
of Arts degree. He was called to the Bar
of Upper Canada at the age of twenty-three,
and after practising law in Toronto for some
twenty-three years he began to take an active
interest in political matters. Meanwhile he
held many offices in the Law Society of Upper
Canada, and appeared many times before
the Privy Council in London. As bas been
stated, he was elected to parliament in 1905,
and took a very prominent part in parliamentary affairs. He was chairman of many committees and held several portfolios as a
minister of the Crown. I understand that his
portrait in oils hangs at the present time in
Osgoode Hall in Toronto.
Before he became a member of parliament
Sir Allen served as a member of the Alaska
Boundary Tribunal, which was appointed in
1903 to settle the boundary line between
Alaska and the western part of our country,
when Alaska was taken over from the Russians by the United States. Sir Allen rendered
great service on that Tribunal, but he was
very dissatisfied with its decision and refused
to sign the award. According to the latest
edition of Canada's Who's Who, Sir Allen and
one other member of the Tribunal signed a
55708-3j

minority report. I have been told on good
authority that when the decision went against
Sir Allen he broke down and cried.
After he became a member of parliament,
Sir Allen was appointed a member of the
Hague Tribunal, which investigated the fisheries dispute in 1910. He was knighted for
his services in 1911.
Sir Allen was a most distinguished member
of this chamber, and in his passing we have
lost another great Canadian. We mourn his
passing and extend to his many friends and
relatives our most sincere sympathy.
I should also like to pay tribute to
the memory of the Honourable Thomas J_
Bourque. Perhaps I was more intimately
acquainted with him than I was with Sir
Allen, because he was a member of our party
and took an active part with the rest of us
on this side of the bouse.
Senator Bourque lived to the ripe old age of
eighty-seven, just ten years less than did Sir
Allen Aylesworth. He lived a full life, which
he enjoyed to the utmost until two years prior
to his death, when his health began to fail.
He was a medical doctor by profession, and
skilfully carried on his practice in rural New
Brunswick for many years following 1889, a
time when the country doctor was at the
beck and call of the public night and day for
a small fee, or no fee at all. He was a good
and kindly man, and was well beloved in the
Richibucto part of New Brunswick.
As was stated by the honourable leader of
the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), Senator
Bou.rque's services were recognized when he
was elected to the local legislature, where he
subsequently served with great distinction.
He was a great patriot with a keen love for
Canada, and particularly for the Maritimes.
In 1917 he was appointed to the Senate, where
he took an active part for the most of the
thirty-four years that he was a member. Until
a couple of years prior to his death he was
chairman of one of our most important committees. Notwithstanding his long years -in
public life, with their many opportunities for
accumulating wealth, he died quite a poor
man.
Dr. Bourque was noted for his integrity
and good judgment. He was a great reader,
generous with his advice and information,
and we in this chamber will long remember
his warm smile and cheerful voice.
Above all, Senator Bourque was a fine
example of what a husband and father
should be, and we take this opportunity of
conveying to his three daughters our deepest
sympathy and our best wishes for the trying
days that lie ahead. We mourn the passing
of a fine man.

SENATE

Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I should feel remiss indeed if on
this occasion of commemorating the passing
of two of the oldest members of the Senate
I failed to record my appreciation of these
two gentlemen, particularly the very distinguished member who represented the province of Ontario in this house for so long. It
was not my privilege to know intimately
the late Senator Bourque, but during my
time here he impressed me with his kindliness. Coming from his native province of
New Brunswick, with his long history of
public service there, he was a credit to this
chamber in the same way that Sir Allen
Aylesworth was to the province of Ontario.
One approaches the paying of tribute to
Sir Allen Aylesworth in a spirit of great
diffidence and humility. I feel like an amateur artist who seeks to sketch a landscape
that really demands the hand of the most
accomplished master. When I was quite
young Sir Allen Aylesworth was in his
prime, and looking back I view him as a
man who was recognized as a great Canadian
in every part of this country. From the point
of view of Ontario, Sir Allen was one of the
finest products of an older generation which
laid the solid foundations of social and
political life in that province. The fine
qualities that he inherited from his own
family and the pioneer community around
him enabled him to rise and be recognized
for his intrinsie worth.
I cannot look back as far as some other
members of this chamber, but in an attempt
to give some personal impression of the
influence exerted by Sir Allen Aylesworth
I can recall very clearly an occasion in
Toronto in 1905, shortly after be had been
made a minister in Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government. Sir Wilfrid and he were guests of
honour at an annual dinner given by the
students of the University of Toronto. It was
my first year at the university, and I have
never forgotten the effect that the addresses
of those two eminent men had upon me- I
think that many Canadians who were educated in that period have been able to date
the orientation of their minds in matters of
public and political interest to the impact
of one or other of the leading men of the
day. Several of my friends have no hesitation
in speaking of the indelible imprint left upon
their minds by some remarks of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier. The occasion to which I have just
referred was the first on which I saw Sir
Wilfrid and the then Mr. Aylesworth in person, and it was indeed a red letter occasion
for me. The effect upon youth 'at such a time
is probably made more deeply on his subconscious than his conscious mind, but later

it flowers into something in the way of conviction or sympathy or belief. As I have
said, I still clearly recall Sir Allen's speech
at that dinner. Seeking to please his young
audience, he treated us to some purple passages of oratory, delivered in measured and
sonorous tones. The success of his effort on
that occasion was reflected in the very
enthusiastic reception accorded him.
I should like to refer briefly to some other
aspects of Sir Allen Aylesworth's career. Of
his eminence in the legal profession I am
probably not as well qualified to 'speak as
are some of those who were associated in
that profession with him, but I saw a good
deal of his activity when I lived in Toronto
years ago and was on the staff of a daily
newspaper. That paper had the painful task
of criticizing him rather severely when he
was Minister of Justice, and shortly afterwards I met him and realized how generously
minded he was in his approach to the opinions
of others.
I have repeatedly heard a jurist of great
distinction still living in this country say
without hesitation, in reply to a question,
that the ablest lawyer with whom he came
in contact during his long experience before
the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England was Sir Allen Aylesworth. He also
added that the people of Canada were not
aware of Sir Allen's great attainments in
other fields than the law. He referred to
the fact that Sir Allen graduated from the
University of Toronto in modern languages,
that he was intimately acquainted with not
only French but with Italian and German.
The classics were of course part of his basic
training, and those who knew him well had
the opportunity of appreciating his familiarity with the great minds of the past.
I think we al feel that the great services
be rendered before the Alaskan Boundary
Commission sparked the outburst of a definite Canadianism in this country. I well recall
that when the Alaskan Boundary Award was
announced there was from one end of the
country to the other a flare-up that marked
the consciousness of that spirit which has
since developed so strongly.
In conclusion, I wish to say that I was
rather sad, but not surprised, at the seeming
inadequacy of the memorial notices in the
press on the passing of Sir Allen. It suggested that the long link joining us with the
pioneer days of this country is weaker than
it should be. There is not, I am afraid, a
sense of interest and pride in those old

MARCH 6, 1952
associations. One cannot help feeling that
there is a good deal of truth in these words
of Shakespeare.
"Tirne hath. my lord, a wallet at his back,
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion."

However, I have no doubt that the influence of great personalities continues long
after they have gone. Sir Allen must have
left a deep imprint upon the minds of a
large number of Canadians.
As a final
word I wish simply ta say again that in my
own case I can date certain very vivid and
real impressions from. the time when he
enjoyed -a great reputation as a national
figure in Canada and I was just a humble
student. So it rnust have been with many
others.
Han. W. A. Buchanan: Honourable senators, a remark just made by the senatar frorn
Ottawa (Han. Mr. Lamnbert) with respect ta
Sir Allen Aylesworth's wark bel are the
Alaskan Boundary Commission makes me
feel that I should say a few words on this
occasion. But first I wish to, express my
sorraw at the passing of Senator Bourque,
wham I knew fairly well and always
regarded very highly.
I arn in complete agreement with ail that
has been said in tribute to bath aur late colleagues, but I wish to recaîl particularly the
stand taken by Sir Allen in 1903, wbicb at
the Urne stirred me deeply. Mr. Ayleswortb,
as we then knew hlm, disagreed with the
chairman of the commission on the decision
as ta the boundary between Canada and
Alaska. As a young man on a newspaper
in the city of St. Thomas, and completely
unknown ta Mr. Aylesworth, 1 sent hirn a
wire expressing rny admiration of bis stand.
What the senatar frorn Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lamnbert) has said of Sir Allen was true of
a hast of Canadians af that time. If there
is a grawing 'Canadian sentiment in this
country, it certainly was fostered and grew
steadily frarn that marnent an, for we learned
then that there was one distinguished Canadian who stood for the sentiment expressed
in Kipling's words:
Daughter arn I In my mother's hause,
But mistress in my own.
He feit that, in matters cancerning Canada,
Canada should stand an her own rights; and
he as a Canadian expressed that view wben
he signed the minority award. Wbile I do
flot knaw whetber Sir Allen would be in
complete sympathy with ail present-day
national sentiment in Canada, he was responsible for that particular development. At tbe
saine time he was loyal to the Britisb connection, for be f elt that he could be loyal ta
that cannectian and stili be a true citizen of
Canada and stand up for her rights.

I have had great admiration for Sir Allen
from the tirne of that incident in 1903
onwards, and I arn proud today, long years
afterwards, that I sent hlm the message I
did. It came fromn a heart that was fully in
accord with the action he had taken. At no
moment in the years that have passed
between have I thaught that he acted
wrongly. In bis passing we lose a great and
goad Canadian.
It is true that Sir Allen was bandicapped
-I personally know something about the disability from which he suffered, and bis was
rnuch greater than mine-but despite bis
handicap, as a member of this bouse he
saught to keep in toucb with everything that
went on, and whenever he spoke we
respected bis thaugbts as those 0f a great
mind.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I regard it as a privilege ta say a word of
comment and regret at the passing of one
whom I looked upo.n as Toronto's most distinguished citizen. Although a mucb yauýnger
man than Sir Allen, my memory goes back
over many years of bis career. 0f later years,
I have been a fellow Bencher of the Law
Society of Upper Canada and, by the way,
have shared bis locker. In recent years be,
seldarn attended the meetings 0f the Law
Society.
My most vital memary 0f Sir Allen relates
ta the part be played in the Alaska Boundary
Dispute, and I bave a very clear recollection
0f the stir af Canadianism, ta which rny
friend from Letbbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan)
referred, not only in my own heart but in
those af my compatriots. I recaîl well a cartaon publisbed i the Toronto News of that
Lime by an able cartaonist named McConnell.
He pictured the American eagle and the
British lion standing in tbe background, while
in the faregraund was a little beaver with bis
bat in bis bands. Under this cartoon appeared
these words of the beaver, "You twa fellaws
can screamn and roar, but 1 amn going ta dam."
I tbought that a very clever cartoon, nat only
in its play on words, but in its precise expression of the tbougbts of the people af that time.
It is not necessary that we debate again the
issues of that early day, but regardless af
who was right or wbo was wrang, there
stands out mast -clearly the fact that Sir Allen
at that time was a great Canadian. He crystallized the conviction that was coming ta,
Canadian minds at that time that Canada
must manage here own foreign and domestic
aiffairs. We have constantly followed that
doctrine with marked and notable results

SENATE
favourable to ourselves, and I hope the time
will never come when that conviction will
change.
As a young practitioner of law I consulted
the late Sir Allen Aylesworth on matters of
legal difficulty, and I have the clearest recollection of his prompt and incisive mentality.
He was a most kindly man, and my fondest
nemory of him is that regardless of the position he held he was never "high hat'.
When speaking of a distinguished Canadian
like Sir Allen, one is reminded of the words
of the poet Gray in his Elegy written in a
Country Churchyard:
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

I am sure I express on behalf of all my
colleagues the regret which we feel in the
passing of this great man-a good friend, and
above all an outstanding Canadian citizen.
Hon. C. J. Veniot (Translation): Honourable senators, as an Acadian colleague of the
lamented Senator Bourque, whose memory we
are honouring today, I wish to associate myself with the senators who have just paid
him a tribute which he richly deserved.
Indeed, through his devotion to duty as a
young man and the almost heroic efforts he
made in order to reach such a high place
in the professions, through his devotion to
his calling during more than half a century,
and through the ever active interest which
he took in public affairs, Senator Bourque
was a credit to his province, to his country
and especially to the Acadian people whom
he represented with such dignity.
I will not linger over the numerous activitics of his long career, a detailed review
of which has just been delivered in the
English language. I would like to point out,
however, that Senator Bourque was the last
survivor of a Pleiad of prominent men who,
toward the end of the last century and the
beginning of the present one, played an important part as pioneers in the difficult and
courageous task of the Acadian revival. He
graduated with distinction from St. Joseph's
College of Memramcook in 1884; be belonged
to that generation of pupils who had the rare
good fortune of having as their director and
professor the venerable and distinguished
Father Lefèvre, the first superior of the
college, whom we all look upon, and rightly
so, as the father and moving spirit of French
classical education in Acadia.

Senator Bourque was one of the successors
of the intellectual pioneers of Acadia, among
whom were Father Marcel Richard, Judge
Pierre A. Landry, Senator Pascal Poirier,
Olivier LeBlanc, member of parliament,
Ferdinand Robidoux, Sr., newspaperman and
founder of the Monitor acadien. He was also
contemporary with two other of our newspapermen: Valentin Landry, founder of the
Evangeline which is still appearing daily, and
Pierre V'niot, founder of

the Courrier des

provinces Maritimes. He was also a contemporary of men called Belliveau, Girouard,
Mélanson, Gaudet, Léger, and Cormier, and
of

many

other

clerics, doctors,

lawyers,

and business men who distinguished themselves at that time.
In order to do honour to our departed colleague, I have placed before you this part
of our Acadian history. Suffice it to add
that Senator Bourque was, as you all know,
a gentleman of the old French school, as well
as a hard worker, during his years of productive activity.
It was especially as a general practitioner,
as was mentioned before, that he gave himself
without stint in the city of Richibucto and
a wide area of the county of Kent. He had the
rare distinction of looking after three generations of patients, from father to son and from
son to grandson. The rnany tokens of sympathy
showered upon the family upon his passing
away bear witness to the high esteem in which
he was held by those who were close to
him.
The hundreds of messages of condolence
received from all over the province and from
different parts of Canada also showed the
trust which the general public put in him.
I was asked by our leader to represent him,
as well as the Senate, at the funeral of our
departed friend. As you know, the terrible
blizzard which swept over the Maritimes,
from the 18th to the 21st of February made
all roads impassable and brought all travelling to a standstill. I was fortunate enough to
be able, at the beginning of the storm, to
reach Richibucto and to spend two days with
the grief-stricken family.
May I be permitted to say that the family
of our lamented colleague has been deeply
moved by the condolences officially extended
by the members of this honourable assembly,
of which the senator had been a member for
35 years, and I have been asked to convey
to all of you, the expression of its deep
gratitude.

subject which has been so very ably dealt with by

in matters of thought is more careless than the
generation in which he shone so brightly. Rarely
have I listened to a more virile, a more inspiring,
a more masculine exhibition of intellectual talent
than that to which he has treated the Senate this
afternoon and evening.

which make him a revered figure in this; an exhibition which makes clear to us why it was that for

Then the Honourable Mr. Dandurand added:
I rise with diffidence to add my tribute to the
eulogy which has just been expressed by my right
honourable friend who leads the other side. All I
need say is that I associate myself with him wholeheartedly and fully in subscribing to his encomium.

Sir Allen Aylesworth was a great lawyer
and a kind man. When I say "kind", I
think that is exactly what he desired to be
whenever he was arguing a case. There was
always a warmth in his heart that made
him liked aind respected. I wish to extendi
my sympathies to the members of his family.
I have followed very closely the senators
who have risen to speak about Senator
Bourque.
In this vast country, it is possible to be
neighbours in mind and heart, notwithstanding the thousands of miles between us. That
is what happened in the case of Senator
Bourque and myself. Although we shared
the same political views, we were separated
by several thousands of miles.
I made an effort to remember the first
occasion upon which I met my good friend,
Senator Bourque, and this I was able to do.
Most of my colleagues cannot go back
to the days of 1896; that is a long time ago;
it seems like ancient history. At that time we
had in the Department of Lands, Forests and
Fisheries a man named Joncas, who had been
member of Parliament for Gaspé, a county
which is not very far from the place where
the late senator lived. One day my minister
told me: "Go and see Joncas." I went to
see Joncas, and at his house I met the people
I always saw there: Henri de Puyjalon,
Edouard Delpit and several others. There
was also a newcomer, a tall, intelligent look-

ing young man. Mr. Joncas said to me:
"This is"-not senator, but-"Doctor Bourque." Who could have told me then that
nearly fifty years later, in this very Chamber,
I would meet the friend who had just been
introduced to me.
In the person of Doctor Bourque we have
known a man of duty, a phonomenon described as the country doctor who toiled under
most difficult conditions. The older ones
among us know how true that is. Some of
us recall how difficult it was some sixty years
ago to have a young man educated how many
sacrifices were required, what steadfastness
of purpose and what energy had to be shown
not only by the parents, but also by the young
man who went to college. Let us recall also
the country doctor as he was at that time.
The highways had not yet been laid out and
everything was lacking; nevertheless in time
of need the country doctor was always there,
and always willing to help out-to extend
sympathy and understanding, and share the
fruits of his knowledge, which is the
strongest evidence of the affection with
which he treated his patients. Well, there
you have the picture of our late colleague.
Doctor Bourque, came of an Acadian family
of New Brunswick, a province which has
given us outstanding men like the Véniots
and many others. There are among the
Acadians people who not only follow a profession, but a vocation. To these people
there is only one way of paying tribute:
to stand by their remains and express the
deep respect and affection we have had for
them, and to assure them that they have
truly deserved their final rest, not only on
earth, but in a better world.
In closing, I wish to extend my most
sincere condolences to the family of my good
friend, the lamented Senator Bourque.
FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 7, an Act for the control and extirpation of foot and routh
disease.
He said: Honourable senators, I fancy that
interest in this house and in the country at
large is attached more to the circumstances
responsible for the bringing in of this bill
than to the bill itself. So far as I have been

MARCH 8, 1952
able ta gather, there has been universal support of at least the principle of the bill. I
would suggest that if second reading is given
this afternoon and some honourable members
desire more information than I am able to
give, we might adjourn during pleasure and
consider the bill in the Committee on Natural
Resources. I have arranged with my colleague
the Minister of Agriculture that if the committee meets and desires him ta come, he
will attend.
In the meantime I will attempt ta explain
the bill. For the first time within the memory
of anyone in Canada, honourable senators,
Canadian cattle have suffered from an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Nearly
every country in the world, including the
United States, has had some cases, and in
several countries the disease is endemic.
During the past year there have been severe
outbreaks in Europe and the British Isles.
Thanks ta precautionary measures taken in
Canada, we have managed until this present
outbreak ta maintain a clean bill of health.
Because the disease has never attained or
held a foothold in this country, the policy of
extermination is considered ta be the only
one ta follow in order ta prevent a continuing burden on the livestock industry.
Although vaccination has been practised in
parts of Europe, where the disease has long
been established, all veterinary advice is
against the use of vaccine or other treatment
under conditions which prevail in Canada.
While the disease is a highly infectious
one and can spread very rapidly, experience
in Great Britain and the United States has
shown that with proper care and prompt
action it can be quickly eradicated and its
spread checked by slaughtering the infected
animals and any animals known ta have been
in any way in contact with possible infection.
The purpose of this legislation is to give
the minister authority ta order the slaughter
of any animal or animals which are infected
or suspected of being infected, in order ta
eradicate the disease and prevent its spread,
and ta pay fair and reasonable compensation
ta the owners of such cattle. This compensation is ta be determined in a manner prescribed by regulations ta be made by the
Governor in Council following a report ta
be made by a board of valuators appointed
by the Governor in Council.
Provision is at present made under the
Animal Contagious Diseases Act ta compensate owners for animals destroyed on
account of bovine tuberculosis, under departmental policies which are carried out in
conjunction with the provincial governments,
who share part of the expenses of the
55708-4

actual testing. However, only those animals
actually affected by bovine tuberculosis are
destroyed. In actual experience it is generally necessary ta destroy but a few animals
in certain herds, and each owner concerned
does not suffer a serious loss in his normal
operations.
But the policy of extermination, which
oalls for destruction of all animals on a farm,
plus a lengthy period of quarantine, is a more
serious blow ta a farmer's operations, and it
is considered that provision should be made
for compensation according to the actual
value of the animals destroyed. It should be
pointed out that the farmer's premises will
be quarantined for at least ninety days after
the destruction of his animals, and he will
be deprived of revenue during the period;
and also that in all probability it will take
him a much longer period ta build his cattle
holdings up ta what they were before his
herd was destroyed.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
as we all know, there has been a long discussion in the other house on the outbreak of
foot and mouth disease, the effects of which
are so tragic, especially in the province from
which I come. However, there are still a
good many points that might well be discussed.
That title of the bill before us-"An Act for
the control and extirpation of foot and mouth
disease"-is somewhat misleading, for the
purpose of the bill is really ta compensate
those farmers who suffer the loss of cattle
and certain other property. It is necessary
that the bill go through as quickly as possible,
and so far as I personally am concerned I
doubt at the moment whether there would
be any object in going into committee after
second reading.
The cattlemen of the province of Saskatchewan are placed in a serious position. I
am hopeful, however, that the disease will be
confined to a small area. In the northern
part of the province from which I come,
particularly around Meadow Lake, there. is
ample grass for grazing. The cattle raised
in this area are not as a rule finished for
market, but are sent further south ta cattle
buyers, who grain-feed them. Some of the
stock are now fully grown, and will be
marketed in the spring. But these feeder
cattle were purchased last fall at prices as
high as 28 and 30 cents; now, because of the
provincial embargoes, the finished product is
worth about 22 cents. I hope this problem
will be remedied shortly. I do not wish ta
criticize the government in this connection,
for we must convince other provinces of our
determination ta stamp out this disease in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Horner: There is, however, the
question of the length of time that elapsed
following the discovery of the trouble, and
the failure to properly diagnose it. For this
the government might well be criticized.
Also, there was a period when the quarantine
was taken off for a time. As this is to be
a subject for discussion before the committee
on agriculture in the other place, more information as to what actually happened may be
forthcoming.
I have not been able to ascertain the exact
number of animals that were moved from the
stockyards in Regina, where the disease was
detected. As many honourable senators
know a buyer for a large packing plant very
often conducts a feed lot in his own name.
This is necessary if the plant is to provide
continuous employment for a large number
of men. In other words, the same number
of cattle do not come in each day or each
week, and it is necessary to have a large
herd close by in order to keep the supply
flowing steadily. Apparently the Burns
company owns a stockyard and a feed lot,
but I have not been able to ascertain the
number of cattle located there or what became
of them.
A further point on which the government
might well be criticized is the method adopted
for destroying the animals. We have all seen
pictures in the newspapers showing four or
five policemen standing near a great ditch,
and the cattle being driven broadside to it,
and there being shot. When this procedure
was taking place the cameramen were on
hand to record it. For my part, I think
they should have been barred. If we are
going to stoop to that kind of sadistic culture,
the pictures could be enhanced, I suppose,
by showing men and women weeping over
the loss of individual animals. To my mind
such pictures are poor advertising. The
experience is heart-rending for those who
have lost their stock.
Having been associated with and fond of
animals since I was a small child, I know
full well that a farmer does not look upon
his herd as just so many head of cattle. To
him each member of his herd is an individual.
Had such a tragedy as some farmers are
experiencing occurred on my farm, I am
quite sure that I would find it difficult to
go about the place. I extend my sincere
sympathy to those men, women and children
who are losing their cattle. Although in the
future they may again get into a good line
of stock, at the moment they feel that the
particular qualities of their dairy or beef
cattle will not be reproduced in another
herd.

As to the provincial embargoes, I regard
them as most unusual and perhaps unreasonable. Saskatchewan and Alberta are the
great meat-producing areas of Canada, and I
have been advising my fellow cattlemen in
the West not to fall victim to panic selling of
their herds. My judgment is that we will
not have any more than enough to meet the
demand. Indeed, we have recently imported
many carloads of beef from the United States
to meet our domestic shortage; and I understand that there is now on shipboard several
thousand tons of New Zealand meat on its
way to Canada. We should also realize the
fact that Canada had more sheep when her
population was half what it is today. It is
quite apparent that the raising of cattle has
not kept pace with our increasing population.
The area between where I live and where
the disease broke out would be as big as some
European countries. I have been amazed
at the quantity of shipments from the Lloydminister stockyards and from the stockyards
at Battleford. In Alberta also there are some
large stockyards and packing plants. Surely
cattle could be inspected and shipped via the
northern line of the Canadian National Railway, and not come within 200 miles of the
infected area. However, my advice to all the
men in my area is to keep their cattle and
avoid panic. We in our area are very fortunate that we have an abundance of feed,
and the world needs all the meat we can
produce.
One of the nonsensical ramifications of this
outbreak is the announcement in the press
that we are to curtail immigration or refuse
admission to farm workers from certain areas.
It would seem to me a very simple matter
to disinfect the person and clothing of anyone who happened to emigrate from an
infected area. By this means we would be
perfectly safe from infection.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We have had no report
on the results of the tests made on the clothing of an immigrant whom I understand came
from an area where the disease was prevalent. There was at first a rumour that the
germs of this disease were intentionally placed
in Canada. As a matter of fact, it is somewhat of a coincidence that at the time of the
outbreak the Communists were accusing the
United Nations troops in Korea of spreading
germ warfare. That subject seems to be in
the minds of the Communists all the while.
In this connection, the examination of emigrants prior to entry to this country is a
question for consideration. I have mentioned
the serious position in which this outbreak
has placed my own province; and if other

MARCH 6. 1952
provinces are permitted to maintain an
embargo, I think I would advise our provincial government to endeavour to secure control over the admission to Saskatchewan of
foreign immigrants. Various provinces have
trade commissioners abroad: surely the matter of the health as well as the type of immigrants coming into the provinces is of much
greater importance than questions of trade. I
believe a certain degree of control of immigration by the provinces would be reasonable. I have some personal knowledge of
immigrants who have corne here recently,
and too often their attitude is wrong; they
are sympathetic with Communism. Surely
this indicates some lack of care in selection
overseas. I have always favoured the admission of people who are willing to work.
Canada has many important projects either
in prospect or under way, and we need men,
particularly perhaps on the farms. It has
been suggested that an immigrant is responsible for the present outbreak, but this does
not seem to me sufficient ground to refuse
admission of farm workers to this country.
With proper care, danger can be avoided.
I believe the government should make a
fresh effort to secure a market in the United
Kingdom for our cattle and hogs. The British
Government has been contracting for meat
with a South American country whose price
has recently been doubled. I have read that
there is actually a shortage in the Argentine
and that meat for domestic consumption is
rationed. I know that the lack of dollars
prevents Britain from buying Canadian pork
and beef, but recently Canada increased the
tariff on automobiles and other products made
in the United Kingdom, and surely something
could be done to encourage a greater infiow
of goods from Britain at a time when things
are so difficult for her.
I intended to mention that the honourable
senator from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding)
handed me a very interesting article in the
Family Herald and Weekly Star about the
difficulties encountered in England in dealing
with foot and mouth disease. It is claimed
that the disease is of three different types,
and that thus far it has not been found possible to produce a master vaccine which
would take care of cattle suffering from any
of these various types. Over there the policy
has been to slaughter animals in contact, but
this practice is not adopted in continental
Europe. If in Britain this difficulty has not
been overcome, I suppose we in Canada can
do no more other than follow our present
course.
55708-4j

As far as I personally am concerned, if it
is the wish of honourable senators to give
third reading to the bill at this time, I have
no objection.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
as one who comes from what is largely a
ranching district, I wish to make a very few
observations on this bill. I appreciate the
sympathetic way in which the subject has
been discussed by the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). The
ranching people are intensely interested. We
have ranches with four or five thousand fine
healthy cattle, and it can be seen how
ruinous would be the consequences were this
rather mysterious disease to break out in
those areas. So, it seems to me, it is necessary for us to make a complete study of this
whole question, and to establish as far as is
humanly possible principles which will be a
guide in relation to this serious trouble for
a long time to corne.
Recourse to wholesale slaughter is shocking to us all. The hunan interest element
enters in, for people acquire a personal and
individual interest in their animals, and the
remedy suggested is a sad and unfortunate
one.
Through the years the United States has
been the profitable market for our ranching
cattle, and I would like to see everything
possible done to have that market opened
to us again. I believe it would be well to
refer the matter to a committee of the
Senate, so that we may have a full discussion and secure all the information we can
obtain on this important subject.
Hon. Thomas Reid: 1, agree with the
principle of the bill, and am in no disagreement either with the bill itself or with the
steps which have been taken by the federal
authorities to handle this very serious problem. As most honourable senators know,
foot and mouth disease has existed in many
countries over a period of centuries. We in
this country have been somewhat penalized
in the past thirty years in being prevented
from sending live cattle to -the British market
because of the fact that foot and mouth
disease was in existence in twenty-three
States of the American union.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You say it is in existence,
or it was in existence?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It has been in existence.
Hon. Mr. Horner: At that time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In twenty-three States.
Due to this condition, for thirty years
Canada was not allowed to ship live cattle,
other than for beef, to the United Kingdom.

SENATE
I remember as a boy helping to drive Canadian cattle from the docks. I remember too
such incidents as the burning of carcases of
cattle which were discovered to have foot
and mouth disease.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Was not foot and mouth
made an excuse for not admitting Canadian
cattle? I well remember what happened at
that time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It may well have been
an excuse, because it could hardly be supposed that cattle in this country had any connection with cattle in the southern United
States.
What I fear in this connection now is the
various provincial embargoes which have
arisen. I know that some provinces have
felt inclined to act quickly, but a chain of
circumstances has been started which in my
opinion, if it extends, may lead to ten balThe province of British
kanized states.
Columbia has not only shut out live cattle
but it has shut out beef. Great Britain
never went so far as that.
Speaking of beef, the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) stated
that prices had now gone down. He and I
have visited a certain part of the United
States during this past year, and later on I
would like to lay on the table some pertinent
figures in connection with beef prices,
because when in Los Angeles I was astonished
to find that beef prices in the stores were
generally far more reasonable than beef
prices in British Columbia. What intrigues
me is this. How can the Americans buy our
beef at high prices and then sell it to their
consumers at a more reasonable price than
we can sell it to our own consumers? This
bas nothing to do with the bill before us,
however, and I shall not pursue it further
at this time.
I heartily agree with the remarks made by
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) about the method of
slaughtering cattle. Those of us who have
had experience in the killing of animals know
that you must stand directly in front of the
animal's head, and if you miss by just a little
bit with the first shot you may have to put
two or three more bullets into the animal
before it drops. You have to penetrate the
brain, which is right in the centre of the head.
I was rather disturbed when I read that
members of the R.C.M.P. were given rifles
and ordered to shoot these diseased cattle
which are held in groups. I know from
experience that many of these animals could
not be dropped by the first shot unless it was
a bull's-eye, and that is something difficult to
achieve when cattle are milling around.

This is the first time in the history of our
country that this dread disease has struck
our cattle, and it is only natural, perhaps,
that some people should become a bit panicky.
I do not quarrel with them for their feelings,
but I do find fault with the undue publicity
which has been given to the whole matter,
particularly the publication of photographs
showing the killing of large herds of the
diseased cattle. This sort of publicity and
the undue criticism which has been made
has not helped to eradicate the disease. On
the contrary, it merely leads other countries
to believe that perhaps our cattle are in a
bad way. I think much of the criticism bas
been made on a political basis rather than
from concern for the welfare of our people.
I also want to agree with what the honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake had to say
about immigrants. It seems to me that our
import regulations are tight in some cases
and lax in others. One regulation which I
feel should be looked into affects live plants.
Canadians cannot import from the United
States a fruit tree or rose bush or any other
plant unless the roots are bare. On the other
hand, these plants can be imported from
Europe with the soil attached to the roots.
Anyone who is at all familiar with horticulture knows that plant diseases can and do
live in the soil.
Speaking of the danger of our having ten
balkanized states in Canada, one province
may wish to retaliate against the actions of
another. For instance, I am not at all sure
that British Columbia might not be thinking
of retaliation because of the results of the
Newcastle disease which struck its poultry.
At that time Alberta refused to take British
Columbia poultry, and there was a marked
drop in the importation by Ontario of British
Columbia fowl of all kinds. That thought
might now be in the minds of some British
Columbians, because that province is not only
refusing to take live cattle but beef as well.
While these actions seem simple at the
moment, they may have a bearing on the
national and economic life of this country.
The matter of trade falls within the jurisdiction of the federal government, and all
provinces look to Ottawa for the imposition
of regulations controlling trade. It seems
that the provinces, on a growing scale, are
doing something now which is tantamount
to creating a barrier to free trade. When I
was visiting my boy in California a prominent citizen there said to me, "What are you
people in British Columbia trying to do by
keeping out our wines? You want to sel
us all your produce, and yet you will not
buy our wine". That is something about
which the federal government can do little.
I understand that there is an agreement

MARCH 6. 1952
amoong the ten provincial premiers or
attorneys general to, prevent, if they can,
the importation of wines from the United
States. It is true they are not endeavouring
to do this under any import regulation, bu,
the simple refusai to buy the wine has the
same effect as a tariff. This situation has
been in existence i British Columbia for a
number of years now, and lt [s creating considerable 111 felling with our neighbours to
the south. If you want to export you have
to import, and I merely mention this because
in my opinion the provinces are actually
interfering with the right of the dominion.
It may seem strange to hear a senator
take this stand. It has been said that it is
the duty of the Senate to protect the rights
of the provinces, and here I arn drawing
attention to the fact that the provinces are
interfering with what I believe to be a federal right. These 'things are sometimes
passed by as though they did not amount to
a great deal; but such a practice can grow
once a precedent is established. Provinces
are made up of hurnan beings, and if one
province thinks another has been a littie toa
severe i shutting out some kind of produce,
if may want to take retaliatory measures.
I have no objection to the bill before us,
and I think it should be put through without
delay so that the farmers may be compensated for their cattie which have been
destroyed. I wish to commend the government for întroducing this measure, and for
the steps it has already taken to prevent the
spread of this most serious of all cattie
diseases.
Borne Han. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuclc: Honourable
senators, I wish to see this bill passed
without delay, a.nd if this [s clone [t will be
in marked contrast to what has taken place
elsewhere.
There is a question which I wish to ask o!
the sponsor o! the bill.
Section 1 of the bill1 reads as f ollows:
The Minister of Agriculture xnay cause any
a-nimal to be slaughtered where he deems it nece,.
aary in order to prevent the spreading of or ta
extirpate the present outbreak of foot and mouth
diaease lIn Canada.

This bill has not yet been passed, sa under
what authority is the slaughtering going on
now? Why is it necessary ta give the Minister of Agriculture this power? If authority
is required to deal with the present outbreak,
then it is also required ta deal with any
other outbreak that rnay occur. I do not
und.erstand this flrst section at ail.
Han. Mr. Robertson: I arn unable ta give
the honaurable senator from. Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) an authoritative answer,

and I think such questions as this could be
dealt with in committee. I arn advised that
there is not likely to be a Royal Assent before
six o'clock, and I think that in the meantime
some senators might like an opportunity to
ask pertinent questions.
I might add that I understand this legislation is of a temporary nature, that it wii
not be needed for any great length of tirne.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: That is true as to, its
compensatory features.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: On the first question
my honourable friend a;sked me, as to power
to order slaughtering, I fancy the minister
has that power now under the Animal Contagious Diseases Act; but of course the bill
before us would enable him. to take much
more drastic measures than are contemplated
under that Act.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
perhaps I should make a flew remarks on this
bill bef are it goes to committee. I agree pretty
weil with what has been stated by the leader
of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the
senator f rom Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
and others. who have spoken, and I arn
particularly interested in the question asked
by the senator from. Toronto-Trinity <Hon.
Mr. Raebuck). The point he raised is one
on which I think we should be enlightened
before the bill [s passed. We want ta know
if the words "the present outbreak o! foot
and miouth disease" would apply as weli1 ta
an outbrea k six months from naw. Although
1 arn willing ta facilitate passage of the bill,
I feel that before it goes through we should
be given answers ta a f ew pertinent questions.
Most of us have no daubt followed the
debate on the bill in the other house. Complaint was made there that the governrnent
had been lax in ascertaining that the disease
framr which cattie in Saskatchewan were
suffering was the dread foot and mouth disease. However, I do no)t see how we can
gain anything by going ita that now. I
understand that the Minister of Agriculture
lias promised, that -a parliarnentary comimittee
will be set up promptly to investigate how
the disease started and why it was not
correctly diagnosed earlier. That comxnittee
may consist o! members of the Commons only
or it may be a joint comniittee, composed
of members of bath houses. I m'ay say here
that I have no wish ta repeat the experience
I had last fail -as a memiber of a joint coinmittee, of which the senator framn Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) was Joint Chairman. 1
do no)t think that we lied an opportunity
ta investigate what we set out to investigate,

SENATE
and in my opinion the resuit was very unsatisfactory. However, a joint committee might
perform some good work in investigating
the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

Another point raised by a good many
members of the Commons was that in their
opinion this bill did not go far enough, that
the minister or the board which would assess
damages was not given power to fix payment
to cattle owners on the ibasis of the economic
value of the animais and other property
destroyed. I do not think, though, that the
Senate can do anything on this point. While
we might possibly reduce the amount of
money that could be expended under a bil
of this kind, we certainly have no power to
increase it.

The sitting was resumed.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. A. L. Beaubien, Acting Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Natural Resources,
presented the report of the committee on
Bill 7, an Act for the control and extirpation of foot and mouth disease.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:

THE ROYAL ASSENT
An interesting and pertinent point was
raised by the senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) with regard, to immigrants. I
think that in future there will be an insistent
demand that greater care be taken in the
examination of immigrants for the purpose
of insuring that they do not bring with them
to this country the germs or bacteria of any
serious disease.

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
The Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General acquainting him that the Honourable
Patrick Kerwin, Judge of the Supreme Court
of Canada, acting as Deputy of His Excellency
the Governor General, would proceed to the

STANDING COMMITTEES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF SELECTION

Hon. J. A. McDonald presented the report
of the Committee of Selection.
He said: Honourable senators, perhaps if
the house wishes to hear the names of the
senators nominated to the various committees
it will be satisfied to have -the Clerk read the
report. As honourable senators know, the
number of members that may be appointed
to any standing committee is limited by the
Senate rules. Last year the membership of
the Standing Committees on Transport and
Communications, External Relations, and
Finance was limited to seventeen members
each. Your committee was aware that there
had been some criticism of this reduction,
and I have been directed to suggest that any
honourable senator who favours an increase
in the membership of these committees will
be given ample opportunity either tonight or
tomorrow to express his views.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.
(See Appendix at end of today's report.)
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I suggest that consideration of the report be postponed until
tomorrow, when it will appear in the records
of the house and honourable senators will
have had an opportunity to study it.
EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson presented Bill C, an

The bill was read the first time.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
before the Orders of the Day are called I
wish, first, to apologize for not having been
present at the opening of the session, and
second, to offer my congratulations to the
young men of Canada who represented their

Championship.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Young?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Most of them were under
forty, and many were under thirty-five-and
throughout my twenty-three years attendance at this competition I have never seen
a finer body of young men or group more
creditable to the great game of curling. I
offer my congratulations to the respective
curling organizations who sent representatives to this competition. These young men
were, as I say, a credit to their country

and represen*ting that university, won the
Canadian University Debating Championship last Saturday evening at Ottawa. I
would point out a slight error in the GuarcUan

that they won the "Dominion" championship?
It should read, the "Canadian championship."
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 5, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor-General's Speech at the opening o!
the session, and the motion o! Hon. Mr. H-owden for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I regret that I was not here the other day to
hear the address o! the honourable senator
from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden) and
the honourable member !rom. De Saiaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin). I had the plea-sure, of
course, of reading their speeches, and must
congratulate them on their addresses. In
this connection, I amn glad the leader o! the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) chose the
two honourable gentlemen f rom. among those
whoma we may caîl "old-timers", one o!
whom had served also ini the other place. It

is an honour which is particularly appreciated, I believe, by those of us from Manitoba, that the honourable senator from St.
Boniface was chosen to mýove the Address.
I should have liked to be here to have
expressed at that time my appreciation of
having been a subject of His late Majesty
King George VI. He gave the world a fine
example of constitutional mon-archy; he was
revered throughout the land, from the humblest homes to the very highest; be was
beloved throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations.
I join with every-one, not only in Canada
but in the world at large, in hailing the
ascension to the throne of Queen Elizabeth II.
Those of us who have read history are hopefui that the reign of the second Queen
Elizabeth will witness as much impetus to
the progress of Great Britain as did the reign
of her predecessor, and that it will be for
the world a period o! unexampled progress
in the pursuit o! prosperity and happiness.
I should also, ]ike to have been here to pay
tribute to the memýory of my late colleague,
Honourable Senator Bourque, or Dr. Bourque,
as he was known to mai»y of us. I like wb.at
the honourable senator from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Howden) said about hlm. I do not
think any person can make a greater contribution to his country than can a doctor, and
Dr. Bourque was a real family physician to
ail the people in his community. We on this
side of the house will indeed miss him, and
I want to join in the message conveyed, to his
family by my deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), ýand. say that we shall neyer forget the
distinguished service rendered by the late
Senator Bourque to his province and to, his
country.
Parliament was in session when the late
Senator Aylesworth celebrated his ninetyfourth birthday a few years ago, and I
should like to recafl the story I told about
him at that time. Two of his former students,
some thirty-five years after they had served
in bis office, were partners in a law firm. One
day they had a dispute over a legal point, so
they sent down to Toronto to get Sir Allen's
opinion. I was a student in the office o! these
partners, and I did not know who was right
or wrong, but I do recail that when they
received Sir Allen's opinion the matter was
settled. to their satisfaction. As every lawyer
in this bouse knows, it is a great honour
when a former student asks you for your
opinion and abides by it.
After coming to this house Sir Allen
becamne affiicted, and bis affliction grew until
he was unable to take an active part in the
deliberations o! this house. But he was one
of our great Canadians, and in the work he

SENATE
did as solicitor for Canada in several arbitrations he made an outstanding contribution
to our country.
Honourable senators, I really do not intend
to deal with the Speech from the Throne
clause by clause. The speech refers to the
hoof-and-mouth plague that has hit Western
Canada, but some of us do not fully appreciate what a disaster this is and what a
struggle it will be to stamp it out. I took the
trouble to inquire in Winnipeg, of people
who formerly lived in Germany, Great Britain, or other places where this dread disease
had been experienced, and I was told that
it is extremely difficult to eradicate it.
Personally I will do everything I possibly
ýcan, by way of legislation or otherwise, to
help stamp out this plague in Canada.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, it is
true that at the end of each session the
financial bill comes to us from the other place,
but we in this house never have a real discussion on finance. Nevertheless, although the
budget is not brought down in this house, we
can discuss financial affairs, if we wish. For
instance, in the debate on the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne I can
discuss any subject that I care to bring up,
just as every member of the other house can
discuss any subject he wishes during the
debate there on the same subject. So I am
going to take the liberty of discussing finance
for a few minutes-not the whole problem,
not the question of debt and so on, but some
features of the financial situation.
First, I am going to deal with taxation, and
I want to say quite candidly that I do not
agree with something that was said by the
Minister of Finance in the other bouse a few
days ago. It may not make much difference
whether I agree with him or not, and in any
event I know that for saying I disagree with
him I shall be criticized by some senators
and other members of parliament, as well as
by some newspapers. According to the press
the minister said that we should not have
pressure groups in this country trying to bring
about a reduction in taxation. Well, I do not
know how you can carry on democracy if
people do not stampede up and down the
country trying to get what they regard as a
proper policy put into effect by the government. I see that the Toronto Globe and Mail
says that the minister's view in this matter
is the right one. With that I do not agree.
The Winnipeg Tribune thinks the minister
was wrong. With that I do agree.
I have been in politics-as a member of
the legislature of my province and as a senator-for thirty-two years, and during that
time I have received letters by the hundreds.

For every person who has written to tell me
that I did the right thing or suggested the
right thing in a speech, ninety-nine have
wanted to know why I did not do this, that,
or the other thing. Well, that was an exercise of pressure. But is it not the duty of
people to write their representatives in parliament and suggest what they think should be
done? Haven't I got to justify what I do here?
I think that those people who made representations to the Minister of Finance paid
him a high compliment. Let me say here
that I think a great deal of the minister; I
like him very much, and my criticism of his
position does not arise from a feeling of
hostility at all. My point is that if democracy
is to succeed, we must have people demanding
that certain things be done. Some of the
people who recently made demands on the
Minister of Finance were described by him
as pressure groups; and in commending his
stand the Globe and Mail said we know how
pressure groups operate in the United States
and we do not want them here. What the
newspaper had in mind was the lobbying
that is done in Washington. There is no
lobbying here. The people have a right to
make their views known to every one of us
in parliament. I invite people who do not
like what I am doing or my party is doing
to write and say so. We may not always
listen to them-my wife says that I never
listen to ber, but I may say that, although she
does not know it, I sometimes do carry out
her suggestions pretty carefully.
That is the way democracy lives and goes.
If that were not so, why would the communists be waging such a campaign on legislators in democratic countries all over the
world? They use this method for bringing
about policies that they believe in, because
they know that in democratic countries it is
effective.
I do not want any Canadian
government to get into the position of
believing that it is supreme, that the people
have no right to challenge it. They have
every right to challenge their representatives
of parliament.
Hon. Mr. King: That right bas never been
denied.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Minister of Finance
criticized people in the automobile business
or the tobacco business because they brought
pressure on him, as be said, to have the
taxation changed.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: No, he commended the
tobacco people.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The record of what he said
is clear. Certainly the Globe and Mail would
not have quoted it with approval if he had

MARCH 12, 1952
not said it, for that paper would surely be
the last one on earth to commend the Minister
of Finance or any other member of the
government for something he had not said.
Hon. Mr. Horner: He made a threat as
well.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Now I want to say that our
taxation on corporations is too great. There is
no doubt about that. You cannot successfully
tax above 54 per cent. Taxation has been
about 52 per cent, and from the lst of January
this year, with the tax for old age pensions, it
will be 54 per cent. That means that the
earnings of a corporation must first bear a
tax of 54 per cent before the shareholders
get any profits; yet I can put my money into a
partnership, for instance, and there will be
no corporation tax on profits at all.
As an example of one -corporation whose
profits bear the heavy tax, I would point to
the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company, in which I am a small shareholder.
The corporation tax on the profits of that
company in 1950 were more than half the
total profits. As a shareholder I got dividends
of about $1,000, on which $100 depreciation
was allowed, leaving a net of $900; but before
taxation the company had to earn $2,000
on my capital in order to pay my dividends.
Beyond that, I had to pay taxes on the $900.
Had I invested in mortgages, there wouldi
have been only the tax on the interest, or
only one tax on the profit.
The same is true of a partnership as I have
said, where each of the partners pays only
one tax on his share of the profit. People
can hardly be expected to put money into
industry, if they can place it elsewhere and
avoid double taxation.
I come now to the question of income tax.
I have only press reports to go on, but I
understand that in Britain today the tax is
being reduced on the people in the small
income brackets, with a view to inducing
them to work harder and earn more money.
What inducement is there to Canadian people
who earn from $3,000 to $5,000 a year, to
work harder and earn more, when taxation
takes such a large part of their earnings?
I am not saying that people who earn money
should not pay taxes; but our system of
taxation in some instances troubles me. As
an illustration, I would point to a certain mercantile company in this country which, in the
period 1930 to 1935, had one particular store
which showed a substantial annual profit. Now,
it was the brains of the manager of that store
that brought about that profit, yet he paid the
heaviest tax. What inducement was there
for him to operate successfully? Indeed what
inducement is there for any man, lawyer,

doctor or businessman to extend his abilities
and earn more money when his earnings are
going to be taxed to the limit? In other
words, why should the man who earns $40,000
a year be obliged to pay three or four times
the taxation paid by another with the same
opportunities who earns only $20,000? Take
the case of doctors. I know many in the city
who earn $40,000 a year. These men have no
working capital; they just use their brains;
but they are paying in income tax perhaps
three times as much as the man w'ho earns
$20,000 a year. The result is that when
a doctor has done so much work and earned
a certain amount of money he takes a holiday.
And why should he not do so?
To return to the matter of corporation tax,
I am quite wiiling that a corporation should
pay 50 per cent, but I maintain that I, as a
shareholder, should be given credit for some
of the tax on income derived from money that
I have invested in that corporation. In Great
Britain credit is given in that way, and it
should be given here also. It may be argued
that industry is buoyant today and is getting
plenty of investment capital, but that will
not always be so. Most of the money coming
into Canada today is for the purchase of
natural resources, such as cil from Alberta
and minerals from Ontario, Quebec and other
parts of Canada. But how much is coming
directly to industry? In view of the taxation,
I am afraid there is not very much.
I feel that the first change to be made in
our system of taxation should be made with a
view to encouraging people to work harder
and earn more money. I am not talking about
a man who has $100,000 on loan at interest,
but about a lawyer or a farmer, a man who
works for his money. I am sure that even
my friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) would admit that there are good
farmers and bad farmers, and that while one
may make only $1,000 off a piece of land,
another one who is more energetic and able
can make $5,000 from a similar plot of land.
Yet, under our system we tax this man's
capacity to earn more money.
I turn next to the criticism that has been
directed at the Minister of Finance regarding
the surplus of some $700 million over the
amount for which he budgeted. I notice that
the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of
Finance, the honourable member from CoastCapilano, said in a speech in the other house
that the surplus would be about $400 million,
and asked "Is that not a good thing? We
have saved that money," I say it is not a good
thing, and I will tell you why. The parliamentary assistant estimated that there had
been a per capita payment of interest of $30.
He estimated that the surplus at the end of

SENATE
March was $400 million although the figure
given in January was of the order of $720
million, which would indicate that some
money had been spent in the interim. I say
that when the budget was brought down, if it
was intended to include an estimated surplus
of $400 million, that should have been made
clear. At a time when we are struggling in
preparation for war, which requires more
energy than actual war, I think we are
entitled to know the facts. When the estimates were brought down we should have
been told that provision was being made for
a surplus. A huge levy is made against the
people, supposedly in preparation for war, but
more money than necessary was taken, and it
is now being used to pay off certain
obligations.
For my part, I do not think the present
generation should have to bear the cost of
preparation for war today and at the same
time liquidate the debts accrued from previous wars, leaving the next generation without anything to pay. When we face Russia's
cold-blooded endeavour to conquer the
world, we should not be required to pay
debts as well as meet that terrible threat. I
would not object to a policy of saving $400
million prior to the Russian threat of aggression, with a view to paying off debts over a
certain period of time; but I think there is
ground for criticism of the government when
they say that because they have a surplus of
$400 million or $700 million it can be used
to pay off debts. That is no answer to the
charge of excessive taxation during this
period of time.
I have already quoted the Winnipeg Tribune: now I shall refer to the Winnipeg Free
Press, which pointed out on Monday-what
the Finance Committee of this house discovered last session-that today the Canadian
provinces are spending three times as much
as they spent in 1939, and that our municipalities are spending more than twice as
much as they did twelve years ago. In the
same period federal government expenditures
have increased nearly five-fold, from $600
millions to $2,500 millions. There may be
some excuse for this expansion, since it
includes defence costs and war debt payments and grants in aid of veterans. But
that explanation does not apply to the provinces. I am not criticising any provincial
or municipal government. All I want to do
is to point out that we cannot maintain
expenditure at these figures without running
into trouble.
At the present time, whether we like to
acknowledge it or not, the world's economy
is being largely upheld by the people of the
United States; it is they who are putting up
the money. From 1920 to 1929 the United

States lent large sums to Germany, and other
countries greatly benefited by these loans,
but when, in 1929, they were stopped, the
world "went broke". The same thing may
well happen again unless the present flow of
expenditure is reduced. The only way Europe
can carry on is with money supplied by the
United States, and the only way European
countries can buy our goods is by using that
money to pay for them. This condition
applies to grain, cattle, aluminum, and practically all the metals required for defence
purposes.
I do not intend to single out any one
province for criticism, but, with an eye on
the deputy leader of our party (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), I would remark that the province
from which I come is the only one which
has kept its governmental expenditures at a
comparatively low figure. The provincial
budget of Manitoba amounts to $49,000,000.
Yet I can remember when it was considered
outrageous for us to budget for expenditures
of eighteen million dollars.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What year was that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That was 1935, seventeen
years ago. Today, in the great province of
British Columbia, annual expenditures are
running to $180 million, which is approximately one-third of what Canada, as Canada,
spent in 1939.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There is an election in
British Columbia this year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, I forgot. When a fellow
comes into this house he forgets about
elections.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Some people do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It may be said that I am
a pessimist. But I remember that, reckoned
apart from Newfoundland, our population
has not increased very much. If expenditure
had risen in proportion to the increase of
population-with, of course, some allowance
for the effects of inflation-one would have
less cause for alarm. I note that the Minister
of Finance has announced that there will be
no material cut in taxation this year. Let me
point out that there is nothing which does
more to promote inflation than excessive
taxation. As an illustration one might take
almost any industrial concern; I will cite
Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting, a good
company, even allowing for the present scale
of taxation, in which to own stock. The company can only pay its obligations with the
goods it sells. For the copper it used to sell
at around nine cents per pound it now gets
twenty-four cents. The difference corresponds
to what is needed to take care of taxes and
the results of inflation. I am receiving from

MARCH 12, 1952
this company just about the same dividend
as I got five or six years ago. In the meanwhile earnings have doubled, but the government has taken half of them. The day will
come when the company cannot sell its
metal for twenty-four cents, then the trouble
will begin.
That is the situation, and I plead with the
Minister of Finance to give the country an
assurance that the government wii cut all
non-military expenditures and give the taxpayers the benefit of the reduction. The burden of the sales tax, excess profits tax and
the hundred and one hidden taxes is tremendous. In a few years the -cost-of-living index
figure has risen to 190. What formerly sold
for $10, an article of clothing for instancenow sells for $19, with no improvement in
the product. It has not changed a bit. Even
since the budget was introduced a year ago
the cost of living has gone up by just about
as much as taxes have been boosted beyond
what they should be.
It was announced last spring by the government that the measures they were taking
would halt inflation. Well, the pace may
have slowed down since last November, but
the cost of living to the ordinary person certainly increased a lot from a year ago. It has
not gone down at all, and I do not believe
the curbs imposed have had any effect. In
that respect government policy has proved
a complete failure.
I turn now to a somewhat brighter picture.
I wholeheartedly support construction of the
St. Lawrence deep waterways, and I congratulate the Minister of Transport on his
campaign in support of that project, even
though he may have gone a little too far.
Canada should build the waterways if necessary, but the United States should carry part
of the load, and I believe would have done
so long ago but for the opposition of shipping
interests in the gulf states and the states in
the eastern section of the country. The project is needed for defence purposes, and even
more, for the economy of the American
continent. We in the West, especially on the
prairies, know that it will mean much to us
in lower freight rates and generally reduced
expenses.
We all believe that the iron ore development of northern Quebec and Newfoundland
will add greatly to the wealth of Canada.
This development will be brought about more
rapidly by the building of the St. Lawrence
seaway. The Minister of Transport indicated
in a speech in Winnipeg, and I suppose in
other places as well, that the building of
the St. Lawrence seaway would result in the
simultaneous development of electric power
-and nothing will bring about a greater

development in our two central provinces,
Ontario and Quebec, than hydro-electric
power on the St. Lawrence. I admit that
it is easier for the people in the West to
support this bill than it is for those in the
Maritimes, but I firmly believe that a hydroelectrie development on the St. Lawrence
will prove of immense value to the whole
country. I say to the Americans, although
my voice may not have much effectHon. Mr. Duff: Don't believe that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -that I hope their good
judgment will prevail, and they will join us
in the building of the St. Lawrence seaway.
I think it will mean just as much to the
United States as it will to Canada. The most
that American opponents to the seaway plan
.can say is that it will interfere with some of
their transport to the Gulf States and New
York State. I am convinced that the commerce of both countries particularly of the
United States, is of sufficient volume to absorb
the effect of the St. Lawrence seaway without
interference with other means of transportation. Further, I want to say to my friends
from the Maritimes that I think their
provinces will develop just as much as any
other part of the country as a result of this
seaway. It is my belief that Canadians are
beginning to feel that one part of Canada is
just as important as any other, and that the
development of natural resources in the
Maritime Provinces, in the Western Provinces,
or in the Northwest Territories, will benefit
the whole country.
I am going to deal now with a matter which
really is not a subject for discussion here,
the question of representation in the House
of Commons. As you all know, under the
British North America Act a province can
never have fewer members in the House of
Commons than it has in the Senate. This
means that some of the provinces have more
representation in the House of Commons than
they would be entitled to on the basis of
population. On the other hand, there are
certain provinces that under redistribution
will lose part of their present representation.
On the basis of the last census Manitoba will
lose two members from the federal house, and
Saskatchewan will lose five.
Saskatchewan is the largest food-producing
province in Canada, and one of the largest
food-producing areas in the world. It produces
wheat, a food product that is universally
needed and which can always be sold. Sometimes you cannot sell apples or cheese or fish,
but you can always sell wheat at a price. I
have been told by those wh.o know that the
nutritional value of wheat far exceeds that
of any other food. Yet, here we have the

SENATE
great wheat-producing province of Saskatchewan about to llose one-quarter of its representation in the House of Commons.
I do not know what can be done about
this. Under the system of representation by
population you can say to me, "Well, Mr.
Winnipeger, you cannot justify the arguments
you are using." That may be so, but what I
want to say is this: although the people from
the Maritimes and British Columbia, and from
Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan are
important, the boys we have to deal with are
from Ontario and Quebec. Under the circumstances I think these two provinces should
concede maximum representation to Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
At the ipresent time Alberta is holding her
own; whether she will continue to do so I
do not know. I am informed that once an
oil development starts prodiucing, it requires
fewer men to keep it going. This will affect
the population.
Thanks to modern farm machinery, a farmer
can now cultivate a whole section of land
in no more time than it took his father to
cultivate a half section. This tends to keep
down the population in rural areas. Manitoba-if it were not for the city of Winnipeg
-would lose as many members, proportionately, as Saskatchewan, and we feel keenly
about the prospect of losing two members in
the federal house. I am hoping that some
solution will be found, in the other place to
give provinces such as Manitoba and Saskatchewan a standard number of mernbers. A
concession was granted to the Maritime
Provinces in order to bring them into confederation. The four western provinces are
represented by twenty-four senators. The
three Maritime Provinces enjoy an equal
representation in this house. I do not know
whether to include Newfoundland among
the Maritime Provinces or not; if it is included,
it brings the representation of the four eastern
provinces to thirty. The wealth produced by
the four western provinces is much greater
than that produced, by the Maritimes. The
West's contribution by way of taxation, even
under this "mild" budget of Mr. Abbott's
is much greater than that of the eastern provinces, yet they have a greater representation.
Hon. Mr. Duff: We produce the brains in
the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In order to bring us into
line with the eastern provinces, we in the West
must have increased representation. I am
not referring to the Senate, because I am
aware of the agreement made under confederation; but I do believe that the House
of Commons would be fully justified in giving
the western provinces a basic representation.

I do not think that a great food-producing
province like Saskatchewan should have its
representation cut down to five members. I
realize that this is a subject with which we
have nothing to do, but I wanted to state my
case as a westerner.
I come now to the matter of external
affairs and Korea. I believe I am expressing
the view of all honourable senators when I
say that we have been very much concerned
since the outbreak of the war in Korea. We
support what the government has been doing
about the Korean situation and its expenditures there, and we are wholeheartedly
behind the Korean policy of the United
Nations. But some of us are really becoming
uneasy. Those who heard the radio address
given last Sunday by a young man who had
been in Korea for some time are disturbed.
It seemed to me, at least, that he described
the situation that actually exists. Now we
are dealing with men-I say this quite advisedly--to whom honour has no meaning at
all, and I think that our dominion and the
United States, along with all other members
of the western bloc of the United Nations,
ought to realize that negotiations with people
who do not know the meaning of honour are
impossible, will lead us nowhere. We are
hoping for an armistice and for peace, but
it is very doubtful whether any tangible
results will come from the present operation
in Korea.
I know that I shall get into hot water
for my views on the matter that I am going
to discuss next. As I say this I am looking
at the senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon). I get a little bit disturbed when
I think about the United Nations Organization. In my opinion the session at Paris this
year did nothing but provide a sounding
board for Russia and her satellites.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We sent over three representatives. They may not be the ablest men
in the world, but they are good Canadians.
I do not always agree with them, but I
believe they did their best. Yet I defy
them to show any tangible result at all from
that meeting. Now, we are one of the countries that ought to be able to do something
worth while through the United Nations
for we are not looked at with jealous eye.
by the peoples of other lands. We are a relatively small nation of fourteen millions, and
therefore it would strike other people that
any proposal we make must come from our
feeling that it is right and proper.
I repeat that the recent meeting at Paris
was nothing but a sounding board for Russia.
Now Russia has come out with new propaganda for making peace with Germany. Of

MARCH 12. 1952
course it is as plain as the nose on your
face-and you do not have to be a seer or
the son of a seer to see it-that if West
Germany joins up with the western nations
Russia's day is done. That is why she is
spreading so much propaganda and doing
everything else possible to get Germany into
her own camp.
I admit that if the senator from Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon) got up and challenged me
to say what I would do in his place, I would
be stuck. But let me say this. I may be
a voice crying in the wilderness, but I am
satisfied that the United Nations will bring
us no better results than we got from the
old League of Nations. I fear that at the end
of the road this organization will collapse, as
the other one did. Why, there would have
been no war in Korea if the United States
had not decided to carry it on. Russia would
have vetoed the war if she had had a chance.
And since the war has started the United
States has done most of the fighting; the help
that has come from other countries has been
relatively not very much.
I believe I can prove my point that the
United Nations Organization will turn out to
be useless. If we felt that we could rely
upon the United Nations, why did we establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization?
Russia has charged that we started it in order
to get ready to fight her. That is not so. The
truth is that under the United Nations alone
we never could get any organization that
would fight if anybody attacked us. And the
only people in the world who can make Russia
afraid to attack them are people armed,
equipped and ready to go to war to resist
aggression. It was only when we found that
the United Nations could not "deliver the
goods" that we established NATO. The
United Nations Assembly provides a fine
debating school. You meet nice people there
and have a lovely time at meetings in New
York and Paris, where you are treated as if
you were men of the world, but do you solve
any of our chief problems? I do not think so.
I have a further criticism of the government. I think it made a mistake when it
changed the original system of sending representatives to the United Nations. Under
that system the representatives from this
country were delegates or alternates, representatives of all parties, and every one had
the same power. For instance, I went to
a meeting as an alternate, and I had exactly
the same power as if I had been a delegate.
I had a voice in the councils and represented Canada on one committee-I was
chairman of the Committee on Law. Somebody may say that a poor choice was made
for chairman. Well, I was the only lawyer
there from Canada. I participated in the

work there and saw everything that went
on. We used to sit around the table at 9
o'clock in the morning, as others who have
been at meetings there know. When an
opinion was expressed-say by Mr. Coldwell,
or Mr. Bracken, or Mr. Martin or by the
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Robertson)-that
was the delegate's own opinion. Now, suppose that after listening to what was said
by the leader opposite or by Mr. Martin
I felt that it was right and that my view
had been wrong, I would be obliged to make
a turn-about and do what now appeared to
be right; and the very fact of my having
done so meant that afterwards in any discussion on the matter in this house I would
want to support the stand that we had taken
at the meeting. Perhaps a year afterwards
it would become evident that I had been
right after all in my original view, but I
could not get up and say so after having
agreed otherwise when the matter was under
discussion at the United Nations. Had I not
been there I would have been perfectly at
liberty to ask why such and such a thing had
not been done at the meeting.
Under the new system the government
sends representatives as advisers, but these
are not in the same position at all as delegates would be. I think our country would
be better off if our foreign policy was nonpartisan. It may be a little more difficult to
develop a policy of that kind, and it might
work a little more slow-ly, but it has advantages which outweigh those probable disadvantages. In New York in 1946, as the
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Robertson) will
remember, when any question of expenditures by Canada came up for consideration
the non-supporters of the governiment took
no part in the discussion. We left it to
the government to say what expenditures
should be made. I really think that the
policy of sending delegates and alternates
to the meetings was an excellent one, and
that in making the change the government
took a retrograde step.
I will deal briefly with another point or
two. Our country needs to develop its natural
resources. They can and should be developed
by Canadians, and the product of those
resources should be handled by Canadians,
so that Canada might benefit to the utmost
degree possible. That is a policy which
everyone of us should advocate, in season and
out of season.

We face a very difficult time. This summer
we are going to be asked for more contributions for Europe, for Britain, for the Middle
East, and the Far East. It will strain us to
meet those requests, but we know that the
free world is .confronted with its greatest

SENATE
challenge in history. The danger is much
worse than it was from 1914 to 1918 and
from 1939 to 1945. I believe that we have
been saved from disaster so far only because
of one fact-and it is a cold, hard fact, which
we all know. If the United States, with
the help of Britain and Canada, had not
developed the atomic bomb and threatened to
use it, Russia would have moved against us.
Some say that she would not have moved.
That is the propaganda that has been spread
around, but I think we are at the end of
the propaganda. I think we are at the end
of the affair in Korea, and that rather than
let Russian aggression continue the western
nations will stand up and fight. But we as
a nation cannot go on forever spending money
on armaments and thus break down our
economy. If that happened the Russians
would then move in. I say we must settle
for some standard of peace within the next
five years. To illustrate the increased cost
of armaments, I would point to our airplanes
and tanks, which only a few years ago were
of the most modern type and today are
obsolete. It is our duty, I believe, to urge
the rest of the world to press Russia for a
settlement that is fair to all people, in order
that the world can get back to some semblance of peace. The continuation of what
we are doing now will lead us into one of
the worst wars we have ever known.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I am most happy to concur in the
sentiments expressed by the leader opposite
in his complimentary references to the mover
(Hon. Mr. Howden) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. As he said, both
of these honourable gentlemen have had long
experience in public life. I would express
particular appreciation of the excellence of
the material and the delivery of the mover,
both of which belied the fact that he was
labouring under great physical disadvantages.
I compliment him on his very able presentation. Those of us who so often have been
charmed by the eloquence of the seconder,
again had the pleasure of hearing a speech
that was in keeping with his usual high
standard. His fluency of expression and keen
mind, his long experience and careful thought
on all matters pertaining to Canada, together
with a love for his country, combined to
produce an address which all honourable
senators thoroughly enjoyed.
Since the last session, honourable senators,
the term of Viscount Alexander of Tunis as
Governor General of Canada has ended at
his own request. He has accepted the post
of Minister of Defence in Mr. Churchill's

government. Lord Alexander's appointment
as Governor General of Canada was hailed
with the greatest enthusiasm on the part of
Canadians, particularly as a result of the very
great prestige he enjoyed as one of the outstanding military leaders during the war. He
was not among us long before our initial
respect and admiration was augmented by
feelings of real affection. Lord Alexander
entered into the Canadian pattern easily and
completely, and his charming wife and family
had the same happy faculty. I had the
pleasure of accompanying him, as representative of the government of the people of Canada, on his journey to Halifax, and I can say
personally that my regret was unfeigned when
I said goodbye to him. We can only hope that
he may find it possible to visit us soon and
often.
To the high office which Earl Alexander
relinquished His late Majesty, on the recommendation of the Canadian government, was
graciously pleased to appoint an outstanding
Canadian, the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey. As a statesman and diplomat, educationist and patron of the arts, Mr. Massey
brings with him a dignity, a distinction and
a breadth of experience which qualify him
in eminent degree to grace and uphold his
high office. Not the least of his personal
endowments is his familiarity with and love
for all ways and things Canadian; and we, as
Canadians, have ample cause for pride that
this is so.
It is the traditional practice, honourable
senators, for the leader opposite to speak
immediately following the speeches of the
mover and seconder of the Address. I should
like to refer specifically to some of the things
he said, and on which I was able to make
only hurried notes.
There are many statements of my honourable friend opposite to which I would not
take serious exception. But I gathered that
the major theme of his remarks was in
accord with the general viewpoint of the
official opposition in Canada with reference
to governmental financing. The matter that
seems to particularly upset the opposition
in this country is that progress reports on
the condition of government financing are
not only good, but even better than the
Minister of Finance estimated almost a year
ago. This result, it would seem, is a matter
of great public concern. Speaking as a Liberal
and expressing the thoughts of perhaps the
majority of Liberals in this house, I have
difficulty in attaching any importance or
enormity to the "crime" which, in the light
of all the surrounding circumstances, has
brought about what would seem to be a
happy situation.

MARCH 12, 1952
Although my parliamentary experience has
not been as lengthy as that of some honourable
senators, my memory of political matters goes
back practically to the beginning of the present century. In all that time one tradition
of the Liberal party stands out-indeed, it
has been 'almost a fetish-that a government
could commit no greater crime than to be
careless in the matter of public finances. As
a young boy I can recal waving flags and
shouting when the newspapers arrived bringing the news that Mr. Fielding, or somebody
else, had announced a surplus-a surplus
which, I have no doubt, was larger than had
been budgeted, for. I do not think that a
Liberal Minister of Finance, realizing the
temper of his party, could do other than make
an estimate-which is just 'an informed. guess
-on a reasonably conservative basis, even in
normal times. However, in extraordinary
days such as we are facing now, much greater
care is necessary. I will go this far, honourable
senators, and say that down through the
years the one difference that has characterized
the old-line parties is that in the matter of
finance the Liberal party bas perhaps shown
greater efficiency than has its political opponent. I will go further and say that if one
were to select one factor which has been
responsible for the success of Liberalism at
the polis since the turn of the century, it is
the first belief on the part of most Canadians
that the finances of this country are safer in
the hands of a Liberal government than of
the Conservatives.
My honourable friends opposite may say,
"That is all very well, but a large element
of luck is involved, too." I have no doubt
that luck is an element in governmental
financing, as, indeed, it is in ordinary business
affairs. However that may be, sound government finance is the keystone of business
activity, for its creates confidence on the
part of the business community generally in
our system of private enterprise. The matter
of what businesses are to be engaged in is
left entirely to the initiative of the individual,
subject to his ability to raise sufficient money
to finance his project; and sound government
policy is a major element in his ability to
obtain money. In short, it is the basis of the
nation's business, and its effects have been
powerful in attracting to this country the
great inflow of capital which has characterized the last few years. Partly by good luck,
if you choose to call it so, but certainly also
by good management, no governmental finance is on a sounder basis today than is
Canada's.
With this picture in mind, I am perhaps
less impresed than I otherwise would be with
the charges of my honourable friend and his
associates that the minister is guilty of an

enormous error and of careless financing, in
that after nine months the progress reports
indicate a surplus of $720 millions as compared with an estimated surplus for the year
of some thirty millions.
How did this condition come about? What
accounts for this unexpected windfall, if one
cares to put it in that category? Honourable
members, particularly those who have had
experience in the other place know that it is
customary at the beginning of the year for
the government to bring dowp estimates, to
get authority to spend, and announce a budgetary prograi which, if due care is shown
in the preparation of the estimates and the
anticipation of income, will produce a surplus. Except under the extraordinary circumstances of war, I can hardly imagine any
minister undertaking to produce any other
kind of a budget. Were he to do so he would
certainly be severely criticized by his political
friends, and, no doubt, by his political
enemies.
In this connection I want to remind
honourable senators of a point which, of
course, is known to them all, but the significance of which should be borne in mind. In
connection with estimates of expenditures
and revenues there are always a certain
number of capital commitments. Every now
and again governmental maturities require
either to be paid off in whole or in part, or
refunded. For example, not long ago legislation was passed by this house authorizing
the Canadian National Railways to borrow
$100 millions on the guarantee of the
Dominion of Canada. Certain other commitments, such as advances to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation on account of
building programs are not met from current
revenue, unless the cash happens to be available, but are the subject of borrowings. In
common with my .colleagues I as a member
of the government am made aware of the
estimates before they are presented to
parliament, but needless to say we all lean
heavily on the advice of the Minister of
Finance and his departmental officials. From
their knowledge and experience in preparing
their recommendations they prognosticate
future trends as best they can, and estimate
revenues to be thus and such, and on that
basis the budget is presented and, if parliament so decides, is adopted. It is elementary
that, if receipts exceed estimates, this must
occur either from -the fact that revenues
secured from taxation are higher than were
anticipated or that, for one reason or another,
expenditures are lower than the minister
expected, or from a combination of both factors. This, as I say, seems so elementary that
I have found great difficulty in understanding what all the hullabaloo is about.

SENATE
As regards the indicated $720 millions surplus at the end of the nine-month period,
anyone with experience in these matters
knows that many heavy expenditures occur
in the last quarter. However, it has been said
by the Prime Minister and others who know
something of the circumstances, that the
surplus at the end of the year may well
amount to three or four hundred million
dollars, as compared with the thirty million
dollars originally anticipated, and my bonourable friends opposite may reply, "All
right; even accepting those figures, the surplus is ten times as much as you estimated."
Consider, then, the question of the revenue.
It may be admitted that revenues are buoyant and have exceeded expectations. The
wonderful reputation which Canada has
attained in the eyes of the world bas brought
to this country an unprecedented flow of
capital, so much so that the demand for capital goods and everything else is beyond anything in our experience. The result, of
course, has been to increase the volume of
business, and receipts from corporation taxes,
from personal income tax, duties, excise
taxes and other sources of revenue have been
higher than was expected. Is there anything
very extraordinary about that? Does it indicate any evidence of carelessness or lack of
good sound judgment? I believe, honourable
senators, that the circumstances show nothing
of the kind.
Let us look at the situation in which the
finance ministers of the three largest provinces of Canada found themselves. The volume
of business done by these three provinces
probably represents two-thirds of that done
by all of Canada. Let us see how inexpert
were the "experts" in these provinces. Mr.
Abbott miscalculated by some 8 per cent,
but in Ontario revenues exceeded the estimates by 16 per cent. In the great province
of British Columbia, where the then Conservative Minister of Finance was budgeting
for the business of war-no doubt with
good judgment-he found that his revenues
exceeded his estimates by 17,1 per cent. In Quebec the revenues exceeded t'he estimates by
18I per cent. Therefore, on the score of revenue estimates, the judgment of Mr. Abbott
and his financial advisers compares most
favourably with that of the finance ministers
of Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. The
fact that federal revenues exceeded, the estimates of the Minister of Finance by 8 per cent
is not an extraordinary error of judgment, and
it is certainly a happy coincidence that the
error of judgment was to the good.
On the other side of the picture is the
question of expenditures. I have not gone
into all the details, and I do not think that

they would be available in a comparable
form. The only time you could make an intelligent appraisal would be at the end of the
fiscal year, when all the accounts have been
totalled. The expenditures have been less
than anticipated, largely because of the fact
that for one reason or another certain defence
expenditures-particularly with respect to
materials that were to be imported from the
United States-have been delayed, and will
not likely appear in our public accounts for
the fiscal year ending March 31, although
they will of course have to be paid during
the next year. As a result of increased
revenues and decreased expenditures during
the fiscal period, the minister found himself
with a surplus of cash in excess of what he
originally expected, and he did exactly what
any sound businessman would do under the
circumstances in administering the affairs
of his business; he said, "For the time being
I have this cash surplus of some $300 or
$400 million. The sensible thing for me to
do is to immediately pay off some obligations
that under other circumstances I might have
to refund". Into that category fell the balance
of one of our national loans issued in the
first or second year of the war, and which
had matured. The minister used some of his
cash surplus to pay this off rather than to
refund it. Certain other capital expenditures
were dealt with in the same way. Ordinarily,
to take care of them we would have had to
borrow, but payment of them was made at
the time in order to save interest; and in the
result either our actual debt was cut down
or was not increased to the degree that it
otherwise would have been. I ask honourable
senators whether that is not entirely in
accord with the soundest financial policy?
The critics get hold of a nine-month progress
statement showing a $700 million surplus,
and they put a ring around it as though they
had not the slightest appreciation of accrued
payments coming due and of all the contingent circumstances surrounding government
finances. Upon my word, sometimes I doubt
whether they do know what it is all about,
for if they do, they take the greatest pains
to hide the fact. But the people are aware of
what is being done, and one thing that I am
sure they will not stand for is an unsound
governrmental financial policy.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) has
said that the taxes are too high. Well, I suppose any tax is too high, and I do not know
of anyone who would not like to see any
tax lowered. The honourable leader opposite made a point about the difference between corporation taxes of 50 per cent and
54 per cent. I am not prepared to argue on
this, because I do not know enough about it.
I do know that the minister himself said

countries with which we differ so radically
in almost everything, but I feel that in international affairs we have got to exercise the
patience of Job. If in due course we find that
it is impossible to make the progress we had
hoped for, we shall have to take the best step
that then seems advisable.
I do not think there was anything inconsistent in the setting up of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for mutual defence of
the western nations. That organization was
established under the aegis of the United
Nations. In the early days of the United
Nations-at the San Francisco meeting, for
instance, -at which the honourable senator
from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King) was
present-there was expressed the fond hope
that a device might be worked out for the
establishment of some kind of armed police
force under the supervision of the United
Nations. That hope prevailed for some period
of time, during which governments postponed
the increasing of their own armaments or the
making of arrangements with friendly nations
for mutual defence. Admittedly it was a pretty
thin hope, and circumstances later showed it
to be impossible of realization. Nevertheless,
for a time there was that hope. And, when
it was found to be unrealizable it dawned
upon the peoples of the western world who
believe in the democratic way of life that there
was a great community of interest among
them, and that to prevent an attack on themselves it would- be wise to prepare for their
common defence. It was felt that if defence
preparations were made, either one of two
things would happen: either the western world
would be better prepared, if war did come,
or the very fact that they were prepared
would prevent an enemy from attacking them.
As Mr. Churchill emphasized at different
times, hadi the democratic nations been better
prepared in 1939 war might not have broken
out.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can he tell us how many
countries of the United Nations have responded to the call for help and are now bearing
the brunt of the battle in Korea?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If I may make a guess,
I would say about ten or twelve. But I would
remind my honourable friend and others that
among the members of the United Nations
there is a great variety of viewpoints and a

great difference in resources. It is vain to
hope that the peoples of some countries will
quickly embrace the ideas that prevail in the
western world. This is something that will
come about only after years of patient effort,
if at all. It may be that in the end all effort
will fail. No one knows, but we all hope
that will not happen. In any event I think
that what is being done is worthwhile and
deserves our co-operation. The aims of NATO
for mutual defence, and those of the United
Nations Organization to raise the standard of
living throughout the world may be beyond
our realization. It would appear at times that
the publicity departments of these organizations are not very efficient. I know that much
has been done to relieve the distress of children and to feed hungry people. For my part,
I believe that nothing will be lost by reason
of our participation in such movements,
regardless of whether the organizations
sponsoring them survive. I agree with my
honourable friend that the results are often
discouraging, but I think we should adopt a
positive rather than a negative attitude, and
do what we can to make the program a
success.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Explain! It is such an

Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators,
I shall not take long in explaining this bill,
because I am sure everyone here is eager to
ask questions of witnesses when the bill gets
to committee.
The British Northwestern Fire Insurance
Company is a very old company, having been
established about 1906. Since it is authorized
to engage in all forms of insurance, and has
been writing different forms of insurance in
the past, it is felt that the word "Fire" should
be dropped from the title, so that the public
will not be misled into thinking that the
company writes only fire insurance. This bill
would change the name of the company from
the British Northwestern Fire Insurance
Company to the British Northwestern Insurance Company.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Howden for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I should like to add a word or two
by way of elaboration to the very excellent

speech that was delivered last week by the
seconder of the motion for an Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, my
esteemed colleague the senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin). I can assure him
and all other senators that what I have to
say will be in no way an attempt "to gild
the lily," for I realize thoroughly how impossible that would be. Rather I should like to
devote my thoughts to what might be
described as digging a little more widely
around the roots of the beloved Canadian tree
whose growth he sketched so effectively.
Before proceeding with the main portion
of what I have to say, I should like to convey
to the mover (Hon. Mr. Howden) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Gouin) of the motion
before us my sincerest compliments upon
their worthy contributions to the beginning
of this debate. Both of them referred, quite
properly-and quite appropriately, at this
time-to the appointment of a Canadian to
the post of Governor General of Canada. The
senator from De Salaberry sketched very
interestingly the evolutionary development of
Canada's status from that of a colony to that
of nationhood, and in doing so particularly
mentioned the contribution which has been
made to this end by our present very distinguished Prime Minister-a reference with
which I should like to associate myself in
great sincerity. I shall try to show later
that he has the distinction of having given
fruition to certain ideas and ideals which first
took form after World War I. In the meantime I think it can be said without fear of
dispute that he has the distinction of having
given a substantial measure of reality to our
nationhood.
No one would recognize more quickly than
the present Prime Minister the milestones
which have marked the roadway along which
we have travelled during the past thirty-five
years. In the field of constitutional development one feels that his sure and authoritative
leadership, backed by his very unusual training and qualifications, give him a place in
this country which I might liken to that
assigned to Alexander Hamilton at the beginning of the federation of the United States.
Someone said of him that he represented the
very essence of the law, and that principles
emanated from his mind simply because it
was a natural repository of the principles
of the law. In the case of the present Prime
Minister, I feel that he is the very embodiment of our law and constitution. In that
field he is part of all we have been, and his
actions reflect a full appreciation of the past
as well as the present. It is fitting therefore
that reference should be made in this

MARCH 13, 1952
chamber to the broad non-partisan character
of certain phases of our constitutional
progress.
I have referred to certain events which
date back to the conclusion of the First
World War. In that connection it should be
pointed out at this time that it actually fell
to the lot of the late Sir Robert BordenHon. Mr. MacLennan: A Nova Scotian.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: -to pave the roadway
that led to the inaugural ceremony which
marked the opening of this parliament on
February 28 last. For the purpose of making
this point clear and amplifying the record
at this time, I should like to quote briefly
from the second volume of Robert Laird
Borden, His Memoirs, at page 900. The following words are quoted from notes which he
made in January, 1919, when he was in
London and Paris. They relate to a conversation he had with General Botha, the
Premier of South Africa, at that time, and
General Smuts, a member of General Botha's
government. I quote:
On January 15, at the Committee of the League
of Nations, I proposed changes that would make
the representation of the British empire accord
with constitutional development from time to time.
On the following day Botha called ta discuss the
appointment of Governors-General and expressed
the view that the selection should not be confined
te residents of Great Britain. He brought a paper
prepared by Smuts and requested me te take the
matter up with Lloyd George.
I found Lloyd
George's outlook more restricted than ever before.
He felt that appointment from the British Islands
was quite essential, as it constituted the last link
between each dominion and Great Britain.
I
replied that if the empire's unity depended uopn
that .ink, it was not very secure. The view then
entertained by Lloyd George did not persist, as,
first In Ireland and afterwards in Australia, a
native of the dominion has been appointed.
Botha's view seemed te me entirely reasonable.

Hon. Mr. Buchanan: That is from Borden?

Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is from Sir Robert Borden's memoirs, published under the
editorship of his nephew, Mr. Henry Borden,
and bearing a foreword by the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen.
May I add to this quotation another brief
extract from the memo prepared at that
time by General Smuts, and published as a
foot-note on pages 900 and 901 of Sir Robert's memoirs.
That memorandum was
referred to in my previous quotation as having been handed to Sir Robert Borden by
the premier of South Africa, General Botha.
It reads:
Present practice Is te appoint dominion Governors-General from the ranks of eminent British
politicians or public servants, and in their office
te regard them not merely as the representatives of
the King in the dominions but also as the representatives of the British government and the channel of communication between the colonial office
55708-5

and the dominion governments. It may be pointed
out that the time has ceme to alter this practice
and te recognize the Governor-General in the
dominion as in an analogous position te the King
in Great Britain. He should not have any obligations towards the British government but should
be merely the constitutional representative of the
Sovereign in the dominion . . . He should merely
discharge in the dominion functions analogous te
those discharged by the King in Great Britain.
And lastly, he should no longer be appointed from
the ranks of British politicians or public servants
but from eminent residents in the dominion te
which he is appointed. There is no doubt that men
of great suitability for the purpose will be found
in all the dominions . . . That such a step would
have the most far-reaching effect in cementing
together the members of the great British League
of Nations needs no argument. And the psychological moment for inaugurating the change is now,
at the end of the war, when it will appeal with
irresistible and abidtng effect te the general instincts and loyal sentiments of all the dominion
peoples.

Many other quotations bearing upon this
subject could be cited, but I do not wish to
take up the time of this house by reading
them.
One further brief reference which I would
like to make is ýcontained in a little book
entitled In Smuts's Camp, by Mr. Basil K.
Long, an eminent British journalist who in
1917 was attached to the editorial staff of the
London Times. Previously he had been an
editor of the Cape Times in South Africa. He
tells of a memorable interview he had with
Sir Robert Borden in that year. I commend
this very interesting little volume of 154 pages
to all who have not read it. On pages 50
and 51 the author records the following:
Then Borden began te talk about the dominions.
He said that lie thought it was time that they stood
on their own feet. They had sent their men te
fight for France, and their contingents had greatly
distinguished themselves. After the war was over,
they shouldn't just go back to being colonies of
Great Britain.
They had proved their right to
"full nationhood"-that, I am pretty sure, was the
exact phrase he used'-and they ought to have it.
Now was the time te work out the plans that would
be necessary.

Further, on the next page, Mr. Long records
these words, and in this reference I might
say he introduced the name of the late John
W. Dafoe, the great Liberal editor of the
Winnipeg Free Press, who was in London,
England, at that time, as he was later, in 1919.
Mr. Long says this:
He wanted me to meet Mr. Dafoe, because Dafoe
had worked out, in rough outline, the new idea for
dominion nationhood. Borden then explained the
idea te me. It was, in all essentials, the idea which,
nine years later, was to be embodied in the declaration of the 1926 Imperial Conference. Borden clearly
gave me te understand that it had originated with
John Dafoe, who, I have no doubt whatever, is the
real author of dominion status, though possibly
Smuts's brain was working on similar Unes at the
same time . . . Borden's role was to prepare the
ground by talks with leaders in Great Britain and
the other dominions. The 1917 meeting of the
Imperial War Cabinet gave hm his opportunity.

towards his object with firm

In order to round out this record I should

like to conclude this part of my remarks
with a quotation from a letter written in
1943 by the late J. W. Dafoe who, as you all
know, represented the Canadian Press in
London and Paris at the conclusion of the
First Great War. He had this to say about
Sir Robert.
His stature rises as the perspective lengthens, but
it has some way to go yet before justice is done
him. I had many a heart to heart talk with him
down the years, and ater each of them, I was in
the habit of saying to myself, "Either he's a Grit
in disguise, or I'm a Tory."

Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It must be clear,
honourable senators, from these references
that what was done here to make the opening
of this session of parliament an historic
occasion of real importance was the result
of the impact of two great wars upon the
opinion and the mind of this country, regardless of political or racial distinctions. The
effect of that impact in the beginning was
reflected through Sir Robert Borden, whose
strength of character and integrity of mind
left one of the main corner-stones upon which
the present Prime Minister has been able to
add to the constitutional structure of this
country.
I should like to conclude these remarks
by saying that I consider these references,
better than any current comment that can
be made, to establish the broad national base

upon which Canada's constitutional structure
is founded, and upon which rests the recent
selection of a Canadian as Governor General.
Before taking my seat I should like to
refer to another ceremony of historic importance, which took place in Ottawa shortly
before the opening of parliament. I refer
to the formal enrolment of Lord Alexander
of Tunis as a member of the Privy Council
of Canada, after he had vacated his viceregal post here and before he had left these
shores. I do not think any happier or more
appropriate event could have marked those
days of transition from one period to another
in the affairs of Government House. In the
relatively short period of about six years,
Lord Alexander, without apparent effort on
his part or on that of anyone else, made an
enduring place for himself in the hearts and
minds of Canadians everywhere. He became
a Canadian himself, and in return was sincerely regarded as our most distinguished
adopted citizen. His own words of farewell
delivered to the people of this country from
Halifax, where he was accompanied by the
honourable leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), bore eloquent testimony to that
fact. As a Canadian Privy Councillor in
his own right, his link with Canada has been
clearly defined; and on the other hand, our
own life has been deeply enriched by this
relationship.

They can usually find them nice jobs with the

do when they make a public recital about
their trip to UN headquarters. I think our
Prime Minister said the other day, that in
view of present world conditions we should

With that I agree.
I shall now devote the balance of my
remarks to the Fisheries Treaty recently
agreed upon at Tokyo by representatives of
Canada, the United States and Japan. I do
so principally on account of the high pressure campaign put on by certain officials of
the United Fishermen's Union and the Allied
Workers of British Columbia. This campaign is designed, in my opinion, for the
purpose of causing friction between Canada
and the United States. According to an
item appearing in the Vancouver Daily
Province of February 11, some 12,000 postcards similar to the one I hold in my hand
have been sent out to members of parliament, and intimation has been given that an
all-out battle will be staged to prevent the
treaty's ratification at this session of parliament. Many of the statements which have
been made in condemning the proposed
treaty are so wild, inaccurate and misleading, that one wonders what is really behind
all the agitation. Let me refer to just one
or two of these statements in proof of what
I have just said. The secretary of the
United Fishermen says that the pact represents "a complete sell-out of Canadian fishing interests". Further on he says that the
United Fishermen view the Japanese treaty
as "the key to complete American control of
Pacific fisheries. Then further he adds that
the provisions of the treaty's annex place no
restraint on American fishermen, and that
"Canada and Japan were the only losers,
because we both have to stay out of the
Bering Sea." To support what I said earlier
about this campaign being conducted for
the sole purpose of creating friction or
trouble between Canada and the United

States, I want to point out that these three
statements are .complaints directed against
the United States.
The other night the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) rather championed high
pressure campaigning. I have no great fault
to find with his remarks, but I do object to
a high pressure campaign which produces
misstatements and untruths. We all recall
the high pressure campaign for peace which
many in this country were asked to endorse
not so long ago, and which later turned
out to have been engineered by the adherents of the Moscow doctrine.
As I say, the postcard sent out is inaccurate
and misleading, and shows the subtlety with
which this high pressure campaign is being
conducted. As evidence of this, I would
point to the fact that the statement leaves out
the vital part of the clause in the treaty
which deals with the three species of fish in
the open offshore waters of the Paclfic Ocean,
from the Gulf of Alaska south, which at
present are being protected or conserved by
Canada or the United States.
At the present time Canada and the United
States have treaties for the conservation of
both halibut and salmon, whilst Canada has
protected the herring. Both countries have
spent large sums of money each year to
protect and conserve these three species of fish.
Under the proposed treaty these three species
of fish-the most important of all fish caught
in British Columbia-cannot be fished for by
the Japanese. Japan can only ask for participation in these fisheries, five years from
the signing of the treaty, if Canada and the
United States are not conserving these three
stocks of fish. That part of the treaty, however, has been left out by the promoters
of this campaign. The following is the wording
of the postcard which is sent to members of
parliament, and is signed by some of them.
I consider the tripartite treaty proposed by the
United States to be harmful to the Canadian fishing industry, since it established the right of
Japanese vessels to exploit certain species of fish off
the B.C. coast immediately, and to request participation in the exploitation of salmon, herring and
halibut in our offshore waters after a lapse of five
years.

That is certainly a misleading statement.
And by what stretch of imagination could anyone even infer that we would scrap the
Halibut Treaty or the treaty protecting the
Fraser River sockeye, or fail to conserve the
herring? If we are so utterly foolish as to
do such a thing, Japan or any other nation
would be perfectly justified in invading the
offshore fisheries of the Pacific.
The statement contained in the postcard is
not truthful, and is, as I say, therefore very
misleading, and I am surprised at some members of parliament lending their support to

SENATE
this kind of propaganda. That is what sometimes happens under high pressure campaigns
such as this. I am of the opinion that if
such members really knew anything about the
fishing industry in British Columbia, or understood the proposed treaty, they would not be
lending themselves to the present misleading,
high pressure campaign. However, if they
want to do so, it is their responsibility, and
1 suppose nothing can be done about it.
It should be noted in passing that the
three main fisheries in British Columbia
coastal waters are the halibut, salmon and
herring fisheries. When the Japanese entered
Bristol Bay, up north, in 1936, we in British
Columbia were fearful that later they might
come down the coast and fish for those three
species. We were fearful particularly that
they would fish for salmon and halibut, and
of course for our herring as well. It should
be borne in mind that Japan is some 6,000
miles distant from British Columbia's coastal
fisheries, and it is not reasonable to expect
that Japanese fishing vessels are going to
travel all that distance unless they can fish
for the varieties 'that are both plentiful and
profitable.
Let us examine for a moment, therefore,
the extent of British Columbia's fisheries and
their value to our economy. The figures for
1951 show that the landed value of salmon
was $28,970,000. The landed value of herring
was $5,154,945, although the catch was in the
neighbourhood of 367 million pounds. The
landed value of the Canadian catch of halibut was $3,670,000, whilst that of all other
species of fish caught in our waters amounted
to only $3,075,000. In other words, the total
value of all landed fish of ýthe three chief
varieties-salmon, halibut and herring-was
$37,821,945, and that of all other species only
amounted to $3,075,000. Is it any wonder,
then, that the question is asked why at present all the agitation, and why all the furore,
and false and misleading statements?
Under the treaty, Canadian and United
States interests in these three main fisheries
on the Pacific are fully recognized by the
Japanese, and so Japan agrees not to exploit
them. The treaty goes much further, however,
for under its provisions the United States
Government admits openly that Canadian
fishermen have, with United States fishermen,
the right to exploit all species of fish from
the Gulf of Alaska southwards. That means
right down the coast as far southward as the
Straits of Juan de Fuca, and down farther
south along the coast of the United States
proper.
This is quite a concession to our B.C. fishermen because up until the present time no
Canadian has had the right to fish in Alaskan
waters. I hold here a paper showing that in

1924 the United States chased a Canadian
fishing boat out of Clarence strait in Alaskan waters, and later fined the owner for
illegal fishing, although the vessel had been
twenty miles off shore. Also in 1946 the
Americans raised quite a furore because
Canadians were trolling in Alaskan waters.
I mention that particularly to refute the
statement which has been made time and
again by those in charge of an insidious campaign that Canada gets nothing out of the
treaty and that we have been sold down the
river to the United States. Nothing is further
from the truth.
This concession will be of tremendous
importance to British Columbia fishermen,
especially as it has long been contended that
most of the salmon in the Gulf of Alaska head
for the Skeena river, where they were born
and raised. This valuable concession granted
to British Columbia fishermen may very well
bring about a much needed treaty between
Canada and the United States covering
Skeena river and Alaskan salmon, and similar
to the treaty between the United States and
Canada for the sockeye salmon of the Fraser
river.
Now for a few minutes I want to deal with
that part of the treaty which has to do with
Bristol Bay in Alaska, a fishery long recognized as an entirely United States fishery for
red or sockeye salmon, and one which almost
caused war between the United States and
Japan in 1937, some four years before it
actually occurred.
Alaska, it should be
pointed out, is largely if not entirely dependent on the fishing industry for its economy
and well-being. Eighty-two per cent of all its
revenues are derived from fisheries. The
Bristol Bay area alone provides employment
for some 10,000 persons, with the catch of red
salmon running between one and a half to
two million cases annually. The Americans
claim that the salmon in the offshore waters
of Bristol Bay spawn in the rivers and lakes
of Alaskan territory, and that the United
States has spent large sums of money to preserve these salmon. Records show that that
country has spent for this purpose $360,000
annually, or some $32 million in ten years.
That was why the United States requested
Japan, in November 1937, prior to Japan's
entry into war, to get out of Bristol Bay.
Japan, it should be noted, had commenced
in 1936 a three-year scientific survey of the
Bristol Bay fisheries, and had one more year
left to finish that survey. The fact that Japan
was at the time occupied with China was one
of the main reasons, I believe, for Japan's
agreeing to withdraw; and strange indeed it
is after all the scientific knowledge Japan had
about Bristol Bay salmon, that at the treaty
hearings in China she did not seriously dispute the United States' contention that the

MARCH 18, 1952

salmon in the offshore waters of Bristol Bay
were born and raised in United States territory and hence rightfully belonged to the
United States.
In view of this contention, then, by what
right could Canada morally lay claim to
British Columbia fishermen being granted the
privilege of fishing for red salmon in Bristol
Bay? To talk about Canada giving in to
the United States is just rot and balderdash.
Canada has no vested interest in and has done
nothing to preserve the salmon of Bristol
Bay. To suggest further that Canadian ,fishermen might fish there if they had the right,
seems to me also to be an extremely farfetched statement in the light of the fact
that Bristol Bay is some 1,500 miles away
from Prince Rupert, the northern British
Columbia port and -city.
Even under the Halibut Treaty, no Canadian
fishboats have ever ventured into Area Four,
which is in Bristol Bay, and, is one of the
areas designated for halibut fishing by the
Fisheries Commission.
It should be particularly noted that the
Americans did not get all their own way,
even as regards Bristol Bay red salmon. They
claimed, as I have stated, that the red salmon
of Bristol Bay were strictly American fish,
as these fish were on their way to Alaskan
territory, where they were born and raised.
This contention, it should be pointed out,
is now going to be investigated by the commission to be set up under the treaty, and, if it
is found' after scientific research that salmon
in Bristol Bay intermingle and are not all
going to Alaskan rivers and' lakes, the Bristol
Bay waters will be thrown open for both
Japanese and Canadian fishermen.
Nothing in my opinion could be fairer. Such
an agreement is anything but a knuckling
down to United States? interests, and. when
one considers how much money the United
States have spent to protect 'and preserve the
red or sockeye salmon of Bristol Bay how,
in fairness, could the United States have
refused Japanese rights there if such a concession had been granted to Canada? I doubt
very much, and no one expects, that Japanese
boats will travel five or six thousand miles
into Eastern Pacifie waters simply for crabs
and sole, because it was the salmon which
attracted Japanese fishermen to Bristol Bay.
It is interesting to note in passing that the
Alaskan authorities have been so concerned
about the salmon of Bristol Bay, that the use
of gas powered fishboats has not been allowed;
sails or oars must be used.
In brief, here are the main points of the
proposed treaty as affecting and benefiting
Canadian fishermen. The treaty will definitely
prevent British Columbia's three most

important fisheries-halibut, salmon and herring-from being exploited by Japan. The
treaty therefore removes a ten-year fear of
invasion and exploitation by Japanese fishing vessels. Canadian fishermen for the first
time will be allowed to fish for salmon and
all other species of fish in all Alaskan waters.
The proposal to allow Canadians to fish in
the Gulf of Alaska is a distinct concession to
B.C. fishermen.
Speaking of the treaty itself, not enough
publicity has been given to the fact that for
the first time in history the Pacific Ocean has
been divided for fishing purposes, thus making history. In effect, a new forward step has
been taken in international affairs by the
recognition that Canada and the United
States have a vested right in fisheries in the
open seas of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. To
suggest, as has been done, that Canada should
have made a bilateral agreement with Japan
is simply to becloud and confuse the entire
matter. To talk of Canada agreeing with
Japan, as has been suggested, would mean
that Canada was taking an insular position,
which if adopted by other nations, particularly the United States, would in the ultimate
analysis be greatly to Canada's disadvantage.
Some day a treaty similar to the one proposed may have to be negotiated with Russia,
whose territory in the north extends to
within a short distance of Alaska on the
Bering Sea, and whose shores, like those of
the United States, front on both the Arctic
Ocean and the Bering Sea. The fact that
three nations have reached an agreement and
an understanding not to fish in the offshore
waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Bristol Bay, where fisheries are being protected
by Canada and the United States, may be
the means at some time in the future of
enabling us to reach an amicable agreement
with Russia. In this regard it is worth noting
that, according to press despatches, thirtyfive large Soviet fishing vessels are now on
their way to Northern Pacific waters. And
no one can foretell just what their entry into
the Bering Sea will mean.
It might be well to point out that in international affairs there is no history which
evidences more strikingly the part which
selfish national interests play in the doctrines
of international law than the history of fishing. As a matter of fact, it is safe to say that
nearly all the disputes in history with regard
to freedom of the seas and the three-mile
limit of coastal jurisdiction have arisen
chiefly on account of the supply or catching
of fish.
In this regard there has been no greater
influence than that of Great Britain itself,
supported later by the United States, and

SENATE

later again by Japan. This influence commenced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth the
first, who opposed the domineering pretentions of Spain, and it has continued through
the years and up until the time when Britain
disputed Norway's claim of four miles jurisdiction, later settled in Norway's favour by
the International Tribunal. These three great
nations, Great Britain, the United States and
Japan, are the three outstanding countries
which have long, and, at times forcibly, contended for absolute freedom of the seas and
the three-mile limit of coastal jurisdiction.
There never bas been any general agreement regarding the three-mile limit; in fact,
some countries claim a jurisdiction off their
shores beyond' the three-mile or "cannonball
limit", as it is sometimes called. Some countries,
such as Norway claimed' four miles; others
claim 10; and Soviet Russia, which heretofore
has claimed jurisdiction for some ten miles
off her shores, recently captured Japanese
fishing vessels much farther out to sea, and
took them into a Russian harbour-something
she would never have attempted previous! to
Japan's defeat. History shows that, generally
speaking, the extent of the jurisdictional
waters claimed by any country is accepted
only when that country is in a strong military
position to protect her claim; and the same
principle applies to the freedom of the seas.
There is nothing in international law to prevent any nation from exploiting fisheries on
the high seas, and without this proposed
treaty there is nothing outside of military
force itself to prevent the Japanese, if they
saw fit, from exploiting our halibut, our
salmon or our herring. These are the facts.
Let us therefor face them intelligently and
honestly.
As regards Hecate Straits, quite a smokescreen has been thrown around this question
by reason of the statement made that Canada
under this treaty has consolidated the United
States' position in respect of Hecate Straits,
located between Queen Charlotte Islands and
the mainland of British Columbia. Nothing
could be further from the truth. The proposed treaty does no such thing. The matter
of Hecate Straits is not one to be settled
under a tripartite agreement between Canada,
Japan and the United States: it concerns
Canada and the United States alone. Canada
has given nothing away to the United States,
nor under the proposed treaty does it consolidate the United States' position in Hecate
Straits. It is not generally known that we
asserted our claim to the straits as far back
as the year 1898, and again in 1907; and

while no official notice has been taken of
fishing by Americans in the straits,.our position and our claim remain unchanged. It
seems strange that on the numerous occasions,
particularly in 1946, when I brought up this
matter in the House of Commons, it seemed
not to concern the fishermen's organizations
at all. I wondered at the time why they were
silent on this issue and lent the Canadian
case no support.
It is somewhat surprising to find now that
great interest is being taken in Hecate Straits
by certain officials of these fishermen's
unions. Presumably it suits some purpose
they have in mind to raise it at this time.
In my closing remarks may I pay tribute
to Canada's representatives who participated
in the agreements reached in the treaty?
Particularly do I want to offer my congratulations to the Honourable Mr. Mayhew, who
headed the delegation, and to his able assistant Mr. Stewart Bates, his deputy minister.
I am of the opinion that the choice of Mr.
Applewhaite, the member of parliament for
Skeena, as a delegate, was a wise and popular one.
I may inform honourable senators that
while in Seattle at the end of February last
I had occasion to dine with one of the United
States delegates, and was surprised but
nevertheless pleased when he told me that
in his opinion Canada's delegation was outstanding and stood out over that of the United
States. Part of what he said is worth repeating, and I quote his words: "Canada outsmarted the United States in sending as head
of their delegation a cabinet minister, a
deputy minister and a member of parliament,
and I think, to be honest," he said, "Canada
got the best of the deal." This statement,
coming as it did from one of the prominent
United Sates delegates who took part in the
conference at Tokyo, is quite a tribute to
Canada, and disproves the misleading statements which have been made that we have
given away everything to the Americans.
In closing, may I say that I 'doubt very
much indeed if many honest-to-God fishermen can be found who will not welcome the
great concessions made in Alaskan waters
and the protection assured to the halibut,
salmon and herring fisheries, the three fisheries most important to British Columbia.

Iron Ore Company of Canada. As you may
know, this second company is about to exploit
the ore bodies of New Quebec and Labrador.
The power development on the Marguerite
River would be used in connection with the
exploitation of these ore bodies at the terminal of Seven Islands.
It is understood that the development and
exploitation of these ore bodies is part of
the national defence program, or is very
closely connected with it. This development
will also benefit the Gulf Pulp and Paper
Company which, owing to the shortage of
water during the winter months, cannot
operate all year. The shortage will be
relieved by the dam, which will be used as
a storage basin.
The Gulf Pulp and Paper Company, which
manufactures pulp, and the Iron Ore Company of Canada, have made arrangements to
form a new company to be known as Gulf
Power Company, to develop the abovementioned waterpower. It is proposed that
both principal companies shall subscribe for
capital stock of the new company to an
amount of approximately $1,600,000. As section 190 of the Companies' Act does not allow
the Gulf Pulp and Paper Company to subscribe for shares in the capital stock of the
new company, application is now being made
to parliament to amend the Act incorporating
the Gulf Pulp and Paper Company to permit
the acquisition by it of shares in other companies. Power to acquire such shares is
granted to companies incorporated by letters
patent, as provided for in subparagraph (E)
of paragraph 1 of section 14 of the Companies'
Act, 1934.
Section 13 of the Act incorporating the
Gulf Pulp and Paper Company limits the
amount which that company may borrow to
the amount of its capital stock issued as paid
up and unassessable. It is felt that advantage
should now be taken of the opportunity to
have this section amended so as to give the
company the usual borrowing powers, as provided for in subsections 1, 2 and 3 of section
63 of the Companies' Act of 1934.

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri moved the second
reading of Bill Q, an Act respecting the
Gulf Pulp and Paper Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Gulf
Pulp and Paper Company was incorporated
by Chapter 85 of the Statutes of 1902, under
the name "The North Shore Power, Railway
and Navigation Company." Later on, by
Chapter 99 of the Statutes of 1914 this name
was changed to "Gulf Pulp and Paper
Company."
This company falls under Part III of the
Companies Act of 1934. Section 190 of that
Act provides that no company which falls
under Part III shall use any of its funds in
the purchase of shares in any other company
unless in so far as such purchase is specially
authorized by the special Act. Section 146
of the Companies Act provides that any of
the provisions of Part III may be excepted
from incorporation with the special Act.
This company is the owner of certain water
rights on the Marguerite river, in the county

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, March
18, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion -of the Hon. Mr.
Howden for an Addresis in reply thereto.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I wish first to congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mr. Howden) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Gouin) of the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. The seconder and his
illustrious father have added much to sound
government in this country. The mover of
the address, my seatmate, was greatly pleased
when he was asked to undertake this task.
He felt that it was a compliment to the city
of St. Boniface, whence he came-the city
known as the "Cathedral City". On the site
of this city was established one of the very
earliest mission settlements of the West, on
the banks of a river. The chiming of the bells
from that early settlement could then be
heard for miles on the prairie. As was said
in poetry in the days of long ago:
The bells of the Roman mission call from the
turrets twain,
To the boatman of the river, the hunter on the
plain.
The mover came down from the West to
make his speech, and because he was not
well he returned home the same night. We
have since had reports which would indicate
that he is making good progress.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I wish to confine my remarks ilargely to the
subject of national health insurance, and to
give a brief history of what might be called
the romance of medicine in Canada.
Very few people associate the history of
epidemics and their treatment by medicine
with the history of Canada; but if one wishes
to go to the Public Archives, and there leaf
over some of the many volumes it contains,
one will find that sickness and epidemics have
had a guiding and controlling influence on
the destiny of this country. It is quite probable, had the early French settlers not been
plagued by diseases from the time of their
arrival, that Canada would not have become
a British possession when it did. The natives
at that time were suffering from scurvy and
other deficiency ailments. True, they had their

medicine-men, with their great long plumes,
their gorgeous hats and loud incantations,
but they did not help a great deal. They were
simply a concession to the superstitions of
the time. The best and most successful treatment was the use of herbs and roots. At this
time, of course, the secrets of the art of

MARCH 19, 1952
medicine were flot in writing, they were
simply passed by word of mouth from. generation ta generation.
When the white people came ta these
shores, and brouglit the diseases which they
did bring, this systemi of medicine broke down
completely; it had littie effeet on such diseases
as smallpax, diplitheria, typhoid fever, scarlet
fever, tuberculosis and the venereal diseases,
ail af which were importations. There was
no immunity among the people af that day
against these infections; epidemies spread like
a devastating flame of fire through some ai
these pioneer settiements and took a great
toil af the population. At that time, and
afterwards, Jesuits and other Christian missionaries, people of refinemnent and culture,
left their homes and their friends and lives af
comfart ta face hardship, misery, wretched
food and poar sleeping accommodation, ta
bring Christianity and nursing ta the people
who needed their help. It was a noble abject,
nobly carried out; but ýthose engaged in it
were oiten. misunderstood, and sometimes tortured, because they were blamed for bringing
in diseases, whose ravages, ai -course, they
were powerless ta contrai.
Then., in the -constant wars which took
place between the English and the French,
epidemics seemed ta i avour one side at ane
time and another side at another.
For
instance, in 1690 the New Engianders decided
ta send expeditions ta capture bath Mantreal
and Quebec. A land force ai same twa
thousand men marched against Montreal,
while a fleet under Sir William Phips was
ardered ta sail against Quebec. The men ai
the navy developed smailpox and died by the
hundreds, and they were Sa, discouraged that
ýthey sailed away without striking a blow. Of
the men on the march, same live or six
hundred died bei are they ever reached Montreal. Sa the New France, at that time, was
saved. Then in 1746, the records state, the
French decided ta send an army and a naval
force ai 4,650 men ta capture Annapolis and
Louisburg, and ta destray Bostan. Again,
however, the hand ai fate intervened. At
least one-third ai the invaders perished from
smallpax; and at about that time a whale
tribe ai Indians was infected and wiped out.
Other examýples cauld be quated af how
disease played a major part in deciding the
destiny oi the country. For instance, in the
year 1702 an Indian suifering from smailpax
staggered into the city ai Quebec. The population at that time was 9,000, and in the resuiting epidemnic no iewer than 3,000 perished.
In those days medical practice was very
primitive. Surgery was done without anaesthetics: purging, sweating, bleeding-these
were the treatments then employed in Canada.

Bleeding for all kinds ai diseases continued
ta be practised. for a long tirne. But these
methods liad no eifect, and the martality
was very high. Sameone lias said oi the
people oi these timnes: "Written, their histary
stands on tablets ai stone in the churchyards."
If we were ta visit some af these early buryinýg
grounds we would be appalled ta see the great
number ai thase who died in 4childhood, in
adolescence, or in very early ad-uit 111e.
However, as time went an, the system. ai
medicine which was and is still being used
made very great pragress, and today many ai
the diseases ai which I have spaken are
cam-pletely under contrai. By preventive
medicine, by vaccination, by antiseptics, and
especially by the newer drugs, a great difference has been made in the length ai life of
the average persan. At the begin-ning ai the
century the average age ýat death was samewhere around fiity. Taday, littie girls wha
reaých the age ai one year can look farward
ta living ta be seventy, and littie boys wha
reach the age ai one year may, an the
average, *be expected. ta live until, they are
sixty-eight years olci.
In times past pneumania was calied the
"Captain ai the Men ai Death." Taday it does
not hold- that primary position, because heart
and arterial disease easily take first place
among the causes ai death. At the present time,
at least hall a million Canadians suifer iram
cardia-vascular troubles, and the records show
that last year 41.5 ai ail deaths were due
ta these disorders. They caused three times
as many deaths as cancer, five times as many
deaths as accidents irom. ail causes and fromn
violence, and eight tiines as many deaths -as
tuberculasis. Much lias stiil ta .be learned
about these dread diseases. It is known
that they are related ta variaus. iorms ai
rheumatisrn, hardening ai the arteries, and so,
on, and in certain provinces departments have
been set up ta study the cause and the treatment ai arthritis and rheumatism, and ta make
special experiments in the use ai such newer
drugs es ACTH and, cortisone.
But while muai remains ta be learned, we
know that early diagnasis and prompt treatment wiff prevent a great deal ai sullering
and disability. Under present econamic conditions this is nat always passible, and that
is why I have aiten urgedt that the totaily
and perrnanent-ly disabled at any age should
be helped .by somne f orm. ai pension. Prefera-bly this provision shauld be adniinistered
through local authorities acquainted with the
individuais aifected. I believe that our social
security programn will be f ar from complete
until sametýhing is dane far that particular
class ai suif erers.

SENATE
This brings me, honourable senators, to the
problem of national health insurance, which
has been talked about for quite a while. I
tried to 'ascertain -as accurately as possible
the attitude of the Canadian Medical Association, and I would summarize it as follows:
1. The association, recognizing that health is an
important element in human happiness, reaffirms
its willingness to consider any proposal genuinely
aimed at improving the health of the people.

I

take

nutrition, good housing, education, and
working conditions, good water supply,
milk.
3. Adequate medical facilities should be

adequate
healthful
and safe
available
not.

I should like to digress here for a few
moments to say that in the past people who
could not pay have not been denied the
benefits of medical care. Most hospitals have
been very generous in opening their doors to
all who are in need, and practically all
medical men have lived up to the high tradition of their calling and given their services
wherever required. However, there has been
a change recently: there was a time when a
medical bill was a heavy bill to meet; but
today the cost of drugs and hospital accommodation has assumed tremendous proportions. The average individual who has a
serious accident or long illness may be
absolutely bankrupt before his treatment is

completed, and as a result he may be in debt
for many years. It is felt by the Canadian
Medical Association that some form of catastrophe insurance should be available for
those who are unfortunate enough to contract large hospital, drug or medical bills.
It is a fact that a great deal of what might
be called social medicine is practised in
Canada at the present time. For instance,
in both British Columbia and Saskatchewan
the provincial governments have been collecting money as premiums and providing hospital
accommodation for all taxpayers. They have
found that the premiums have generally been
too small to meet rising costs, and so they
have suggested that an individual entering
a hospital should pay at least a token amount.
In Alberta several municipalities have made
arrangements by which a person in hospital
pays $1 a day, the additional cost being shared
equally by the municipality concerned and
the province. If there is a system whereby
some small payment is made when a person
calls for medical care or enters a hospital,
the ordinary self-reliant person feels free
to use medical and hospital services, even in
minor cases. A great many people have the
notion that if nothing is paid at the time
they are accepting charity, and they do not

Medical Association.

the principle that

I take that to mean that the association lays
down the principle that state medicine, with
the doctors on a salary, is definitely out.
5. The association points out that about one and
a half million people in Canada are now under
some form of prepaid medical care.

The C.M.A., having approved of the principle of health insurance and having observed
the prepayment medical plans, in 1950 proposed to extend those plans and form what

is called the Trans-Canada Medical Services.
It was hoped that this would extend so that
every Canadian citizen would, by paying a
premium, be able to insure himself against
the unpredictable costs of serious illness or
accident. It was also felt that the time would
come when some government agencies would
pay the premiums for those who were unable
to pay them.
The association also feels that progress
along the lines of health should develop by
stages, because it realizes that if any big
scheme was hastily put into operation
disaster would likely result. It believes that
a good foundation should be laid before any
extensive scheme is tried out. For instance,
hospital accommodation and trained personnel should be available, and of course the
financing should be arranged.
The association does not want to get into
a controversy with the government at any
time. And I may say that the present Minister of National Health and Welfare, Mr. Paul
Martin, has been very good in consulting the
association's officers and listening to their
advice. Really quite a lot has been accomplished along these lines, but it has been
done in a small way and over a limited area.
That has one great advantage, however,
because reliable information is furnished,
and if the scheme should fail no great
national disaster will follow.
In conclusion I wish to review the national
health policy that was laid down in May 1948
by the federal government. It made $30
million available annually for grants to the
provinces for health purposes, mostly on a
dollar-for-dollar basis. Of course, this put
the problem up to the provinces, but they
have reached out and taken advantage of the
offer to a great extent. In the first year 25-8
per cent of the grant was used; in the next

MARCH 19, 1952
yeair 47 -3 per cent was used; and in the third
year, up to March 31, 1951, some 53-1 per
cent was used.
Of course, the big item of expense is for
hospital construction. It was hoped that in
a five-year program some 40,000 hospital
beds would be provided, and $13 million a
year was allotted for this purpose. Up to
March of last year some 28,355 beds had
been made available in new hospitals or
additions to previously existing hospitals that
had been constructed in some 120 different
communities.
In addition to hospital grants, money was
made available to the provinces for general
health measures, for mental health and
research, for personnel training, for cancer
control, for treatment of venereal disease and
tuberculosis, and as well for the conducting
of a national health survey.
The Canadian Medical Association has sent
some of its officers to other countries to see
what results were being obtained there in
health insurance schemes. Under the present
Minister, Mr. Martin, a careful study has
been made by the department of what is
being done under the British national health
services, and under the programs in New
Zealand, Sweden and Denmark. This was
done in order to see if these public health
measures were really improving the health
of the people and the standard of medical
practice.
In conclusion, in these days when social
security measures are being greatly extended,
protection of the health of the people should
have first consideration, because so much
can be done to avoid- or banish misery and
despair. Measures which help those who are
disabled or in pain, those whose lives are
darkened, and whose hopes are dim, will
add most to the sum total of human happiness,
welfare and contentment.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. A. McDonald: Honourable senators,
I hope I am not imposing on your patience
by speaking at this time, but I should like very
much to leave for Halifax tomorrow afternoon. If I am allowed to stay pretty close to
my manuscript, I promise not to speak for
more than fifteen minutes.
I am sure we have all enjoyed very mucb
the interesting and constructive address of the
honourable gentleman who has just spoken;
in fact, we have enjoyed all of the addresses,
including those of the mover and the seconder;
all have shown a great deal of thought and
care in preparation, and all were well
delivered. The debate, up to the present
moment, has been on a very high plane.

As we review the past year, ail honourable
senators wil agree, I think, that kind Providence has dealt bountifully with Canada and
her people, and it is with sincere gratitude for
the many great blessings which our nation has
enjoyed that we enter upon our duties this
session, trusting that we may be divinely
guided and render increasing service. Our
service and sacrifice seem very small when
we think of what members of the active
;services, especially those in Korea, have to
endure. We trust that peace may speedily
come to the troubled areas.
This and some other countries are blessed
by having many talented and fine Christian
men and women in public office. I am convinced, as I am sure are al here, that nothing
could help more in bringing peace and solving
our most serious problems than a rededication
of public representatives in all countries to
the application of Christian principles in their
thoughts, words and deeds. If that should
take place, there would be more Colombo
plans and more security for those who need
it; strife and much of the suffering experienced today would cease.
The year 1951 was a good year for Canadian business at home and abroad, and we
have reason to believe that the outlook for
. 1952 is favourable. The gross national production of Canada in 1951 amounted to $21- 1
billions, an increase of more than 16 per cent
over that of 1950. All income components
of the gross national production reflect the
high level of economic activity prevailing
during 1951. The number of employed persons increased by about 3 per cent, but total
salaries and wages were about 15 per cent
higher than in 1950. For the year, unemployment will amount to about 2 per cent of the
total labour force.
Although farm income for 1951 was higher
than for 1950, so were farm operating costs.
A large part of the western grain crop
remains to be harvested or threshed. Most
of the crop now lying under the snow will
be harvested this spring, but its quality will
be lowered. Cash income from livestock was
higher during the past year than it was in
1950. Declines in marketing were offset by
higher prices, but these have dropped
recently, since the close of the year. Smaller
marketing of sheep and lambs brought lower
returns. Higher average livestock prices and
substantial Canadian Wheat Board payments
during the first six months were the two main
factors in higher farm income.
Unfortunately, manpower in agriculture
has dropped again. Taking 1939 as 100, 1950
was 78-2 and 1951 was 74-5. This lack of
manpower on our farms is a realy serious
problem. It is difficult to keep men on farms

SENATE

when they have to work longer hours and at
lower wages than prevail in other industries.
Even immigrant farm labour is soon enticed
from the farms when offered greater pay for
shorter hours of labour. Until the farmer
can realize larger returns from the sale of his
products, it is very difficult for him to find the
money to increase the wages to his help. The
average Canadian farm labour wage is now
$4.60 per day with board, and $5.70 without
board.
Many farmers are partially solving the
labour problem by the more extensive use
of machinery; but in many cases, for instance
where livestock has to be cared for, extra
labour is required. Then too, unfortunately,
it is not economically sound to replace horses
with machine power unless the farmers'
operations are large enough to justify the
extra expense. Unfortunately, this tendency
to solve the labour problem by the change
from horse to machine power is causing a
financial crisis on a number of farms where
the sale of products is too small to pay for
the high initial cost and depreciation on
expensive equipment.
When considering farmers' problems, it is
well to remember that farming involves a
great financial risk which we cannot control,
and that an important influence on the cost
of production is the weather. Aside from a
little extra gas and labour in harvesting, it
costs as much to handle a grain crop of
ten to fifteen bushels per acre as it does for
one of from fifty to ninety bushels. Seed,
fertilizer and cultivation costs are identical,
and there is little or no difference in overhead for machinery, rent, taxes or even wages.
The unpredictableness of the weather for any
length of time beyond two or three days
makes farming the most economically hazardous undertaking of the major occupations.
Because of increased food prices-and
sometimes too little of these increased prices
reach the farmers' pockets-there is a growing consumer resentment against the producer. But it should be remembered that
basic food prices for the 1935-39 period were
abnormally low, and this is the period which
is taken as 100 in comparing today's prices.
Those were depression years, when farmers
took what they could get, even if it meant
a loss. The farmer cannot always reduce
production to meet the demand, as the manufacturer can, and when the farmer's production is greater than the demand he must
sacrifice price. During the depression years
a dollar would buy a week's supply of
vegetables, and $2 would go a long way
towards supplying a family with meat for
the same period. It is against such low
prices that today's prices are compared in
the index.

There are other important reasons for the
increase in the food index.
There are
increased packaging and processing charges,
which involve many additional labour charges
that were unknown in former methods of
handling some food. There are also increased
transportation costs and higher costs for
middlemen involved.
The Minister of Agriculture for Ontario,
T. L. Kennedy, has said that the farmer does
not benefit when there is a substantial
increase in the price of his product to the
consumer, and to prove his point he recently
released the following figures:

It is important also to remember that,
despite what some consumers think are
abnormal prices for most foods, farmers are
not increasing production; but, rather, there
is a dangerous downward trend in relation
to population. Today's higher prices are not
attractive to the farmer, mainly because of
the increasing production costs and serious

labour shortage.
In recent weeks the lower prices for hog
and poultry products, together with increasing feed costs, have been creating a critical
situation for our producers. Because of the
very high prices for protein feeds many
farmers are becoming discouraged.
One
prominent farmer in Nova Scotia recently
estimated the total cost of producing a 150-

pound dressed hog at around $44 as compared
with the floor price, at 26 cents per pound,
of $39.
Consumers and producers would welcome
a thorough price inquiry. Such an inquiry
should, of course, include an examination of
prices of the more generally used articles
required in production, as well as the spreads
of wholesalers, middlemen and retailers.
Many of our people today feel that exorbitant fees are being taken out of the consumer's dollars after the products leave the
producers' warehouses. Whether or not this
feeling is justified, all groups of our people
would be in favour of a price inquiry, and
it would help materially in doing away with
a resentment that is growing between large
sections of our population. Also, if unwarranted increases are anticipated, a wellorganized inquiry in the near future would
be helpful in keeping them under control.

MARCH 19, 1952
Our Prime Minister and members of the
government deserve our sincere thanks for
their untiring service and for much progressive legislation during the past year. The
government also is to be commended for
the prompt action it has taken to rid our herds
of the most regrettable outbreak of foot-andmouth disease. I trust that the provinces will
remove their embargoes as quickly as possible;
but if the United States continues for very
long its embargo against our stock and meats
it may be necessary for the government to
establish floor prices under beef and lamb.
Pork already has been dealt with. A situation
could develop where ceiling prices should also
be established for the protection of consumers.
Some of the problems that I had the honour
of bringing to your attention during the
debate a year ago last February have already
been solved,. There is one, however, which
is still unsolved, and it is still a live issue
in my province. I refer to the need for
improved transportation facilities, particularly
in western Nova Scotia. But first I wish to
say that the action of the honourable member
for Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) in
endeavouring to secure a further reduction in
the time it takes the Ocean Limited to cover
the distance from Halifax to Montreal, is to
be commended. The management has made
sone improvements in equipment as well as in
time, but ways should be found of giving
us a service at least as fast as we had many
years ago.
As regards needed improvements in western
Nova Scotia, I would like to emphasize againand very briefly, as I went into a detailed
explanation at the session last year-the
importance of the C.P.R. having needed, rights
now enjoyed by the C.N.R. right into and at
HalifaxHon. Mr. Isnor: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: -also, of establishing
a rail -car ferry from Digby to Saint John,
and improved regular year-round transportation to the New England States. An airport
at Halifax, built to satisfactorily handle heavy
aircraft travel, is a necessity.
As the Eastern Steamship Lines seem determined to sell the s.s. Yarmouth, I hope the
government will either purchase it, and have
the C.N.R. operate it from Yarmouth to
Boston, or provide a subsidy so that an
independent company can give proper service
to the people of western Nova Scotia and
help to develop still further the tourist industry. We would emphasize again, too, the
advantages to our people of further reducing
tariffs as much as practically possible. For

our development these suggested changes are
vital, and to me they do not seem unreasonable.
Now that the St. Lawrence Seaway project
is assured of the support of the Maritimes,
and largely for the benefit of other parts of
Canada, co-operation should be extended to
bring about the improvements for western
Nova Scotia which I have again suggested.
Before closing, may I also briefly support
the request of many in the Maritimes that
shipbuilding be given greater interest and
support. Shipping interests tell me that they
are concerned about the shrinkage of the
Maritime merchant marine; and, while realizing that conditions then and now are different, we earnestly request cooperation by the
appropriate government departments to help
in building up this great industry to as
nearly as possible the dimensions it attained
in the last century, when our shipping was
found on the seven seas and brought employment and wealth to our people.
The shipyards of the Maritimes would have
developed much as those of the St. Lawrence
and the Great Lakes have done if ships had
been built in our ports during the war years,
when our yards were looking after repairs;
and we now respectfully submit that our yards
should be given a chance to expand through the
government building ships in our ports, where
the Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland
ferries should normally have been built.
I have not dealt with the needs of our
fishermen. I leave that subject to honourable
members who are better versed in that problem than I am. The honourable member for
Milford-Hants, (Hon. Mr. Hawkins), of course,
is fully informed on everything pertaining to,
the production and marketing of wood
products. I would, however, like to support
the requests that have been made in the other
place for needed assistance to the fishermen
along our shores who have lost their fishing
gear through the heavy Atlantic storms which
occurred late last fall and during the winter.
Many of them require this assistance in order
to get back to their fishing.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Did I understand the
honourable senator to say that a floor price
for hogs is now in effect?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes: it is $26 per hundred at Winnipeg, I believe.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, it is not operating.
In many places they are selling at 15 cents.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Question!
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Lacasse was agreed
to, and the debate was adjourned.

SENATE
EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act to amend the Export
and Import Permits Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
very simple. It deals with only one section
of the Export and Import Permits Act, which
was passed in 1947; and that section 13, bas
to do with the procedure for prosecution of
violations of the act.
Under section 13 as it was passed in 1947
two procedures were provided for. One was
that an offender could be prosecuted by way
of summary conviction under Part 15 of the
Criminal Code, under which the penalty was
a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment up to
one year, or both fine and imprisonment.
The second procedure was that a person
could be charged by way of indictment, and
in event of conviction the fine could be up
to $5,000 and the term of imprisonment up
to five years, and the penalty could include
both the fine and imprisonment.
Now I will state what the proposed amendment does, and why it is proposed. It deals
with the procedure by way of summary conviction, and it increases the maximum fine
from $500 to $5,000. That is the only change
made in the penalty, for the term of imprisonment remains the same-up to one year.
Then a subsection is added to section 13 to
provide that, notwithstanding the fact that
under the Criminal Code proceedings by way
of summary conviction must take place
within six months of the date of the commission of the offence, proceedings under this
Act may take place by way of summary conviction in relation to offences committed
within twelve months of the date on which
the proceedings are instituted.
Having stated what the proposed change is,
I will say why it is brought in. The statute
deals with strategic materials and provides
for certain requirements in connection with
their export and import. The main materials
to which the export provisions of this Act
would apply, unless the Governor in Council
deems it necessary to add others, are war
supplies and materials, arms and so on. A
permit in perfectly satisfactory form may be
secured for export to a country to which
Canada has no objection to permitting export
of materials of that kind; but if under such
a permit materials are or have been diverted
to a source that is not friendly, and not
regarded by Canada as a good security risk,
it might well be eight or ten months before
this fact became known. That is why it is
desired to extend the period within which

summary conviction proceedings may be
taken. The policy of the government is that
prosecutions for offences of this kind, once
determined upon, should be undertaken and
carried through promptly in order to provide
the greatest possible deterrent effect upon
would-be offenders.
I think that it is also in the interest of the
the accused person himself to have the
charge against him disposed of as quickly
and as summarily as possible. He still has
his right of appeal. Proceedings by way of
indictment take much longer than proceedings for summary conviction, and therefore
the length of time elapsing between commission of the alleged offence and completion
of the proceedings is greater. The reason
for increasing the possible fine from a maximum of $500 to a maximum of $5,000 is
that it is hoped this also will have a deterrent effect upon persons who otherwise might
offend against the Act.
The government feels that as a matter of
policy this section should be amended so
as to make it possible to bring more of the
prosecutions that may become necessary
under this Act by way of summary conviction rather than through the longer procedure of indictment. And accused persons may
get a break by reason of the fact that
although under the amendment the maximum possible fine under summary proceedings is increased to $5,000, as it is under
procedure by way of indictment, the maximum
possible prison sentence that may be imposed upon summary conviction remains at
one year, whereas upon conviction in proceedings by way of indictment the imprisbnment
may be five years.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Can my honourable
friend inform us if any prosecutions were
taken under this section in the past year?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not in a position
to answer that question. I think we might
get that information in committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Could the honourable member tell us why it was considered advisable
to raise the fine from a maximum of $500 to
a maximum of $5,000, and yet keep the maximum of time of imprisonment at one year?
Under the law as it is now a convicted first
person might have the choice of paying $500
or going to prison for a year, and under the
amendment he might have the option of
paying $5,000 or serving a jail term which
still would be only one year.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am sorry that I did
not make it clear that an accused individual

65

MARCH 19, 1952
or company has no choice in the matter of
whether the prosecution shail be by way of
summary conviction or by indictment. The
choice of how the -charge is laid rests with
the prosecutor.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
i-ead the second time.

FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
CONSIDERATION POSTPONED

Hon. T. A. Crerar presented the first report

on the Standing Committee on Finance.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant,
as folows:The Standing Committee on Finance beg leave
to make their first report as follows:
Your committee recommend that their quorum be
reduced to seven members.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I make an observa-

tion which it was unnecessary to embody in
the report? The Committee on Finance as set
up now consists of seventeen members. Notice

has been given for next Tuesday of a motion
to increase substantially the membership of
the committee. In the meantime, however,
I think it is important that we get started

as soon as possible, so I have asked the
members of the committee as selected yesterday to attend

an informal

meeting of an

exploratory character after the Senate rises
today, to consider what lines our inquiry
might take. As the committee is to be substantially enlarged, I would add that every
honourable senator in the house is welcome
to attend today's meeting.
Hon. Mr. King: I am inclined to think that
the matter should stand over until the motion

has been concurred in.

Our committees are

not yet organized, and there is no great need

for haste.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to ask the
mover of this motion why, if the numbers
of the committee are to be substantially
increased, the quorum is to be reduced.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think the quorum

MARCH 20, 1952
appointment of the present Governor General
was just a political stunt, and that the public
mind was unprepared to witness it.
Two or three members in that debate
strenuousy objected to the views expounded
by the senators just mentioned, and only one
of them is left among us-our good colleague
from Saltcoats-to see the wish of his opponents in that debate fulfilled, whilst they
themselves are not living to see the glorious
culmination of their hope. Such is the irony
of fatel
I recall these facts to show the gradual
evolution of the minds in this Canada of ours
towards an ever greater measure of national
grandeur, and also to demonstrate that sooner
or later in a democracy such as ours the
will- of the people prevails, whatever party
may be in office at the time.
Let us give credit to whomsoever credit is
due. I therefore add my compliments to
those already extended to the government of
the day by my honourable friends, the mover
(Hon. Mr. Howden) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) of the address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne.
I do not think the government deserves
our cordial approval only for the appointment
of a Canadian-born Governor General, in
principle and in fact; it must also be commended for the choice it made of the new
incumbent, a most distinguished citizen, who
is at the same time a well-trained' diplomat
and a perfect bilinguist. I believe that he is a
man who at no time would forget the rules of
strict impartiality which are the absolute
requisite of his high office, any more than Sir
Robert Borden, Sir William Mulock or Sir
Robert Falconer would have done.
The present government also deserves our
congratulations for many other achievements,
and most particularly for its stand on internation-al matters. Would it not be unfair,
gentlemen, to say that the tremendous advance
Canada has achieved in that sphere is just a
coincidence? Did not the choice of our representatives abroad, as so eloquently suggested
by my honourable friend from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin), have something to do with
it? And has not the general attitude of Canada, from San Francisco to Lisbon, been a
credit to those who are at present presiding
over the destinies of our fast-growing nation?
And the same can be said about international
trade and foreign exchange, even if one takes
into account the bountiful co-operation of
Mother Nature in so far as natural resources
are concerned.
As to immigration, some reservations
should be made, of course. What a problem
it is under the present circumstances! We

all agree that judicious segregation should
be made in that field, in spite of the universal
recognition that Canada needs and can feed
more and more people.

It

is up to us to

see that the subversive elements which are
causing all the trouble in foreign lands are
not allowed to seek shelter and protection
on our shores. One must also bear in mind
that Canada is not altogether ready to absorb
as much new blood as some interested countries would like to get rid of, because of
seasonal unemployment and for many other
reasons. Is Canada's health good enough to
stand the reaction from such massive transfusions? And is all the blood we might plan
to transfuse of a type corresponding to our
own? I for one do not believe so. A feeling
of human charity is in order, of course, but
not to the detriment of justice and our own
security, for peoples are not bound to sacrifice
themselves in the same measure as individuals.
There are two other facts that I also wish
to mention, and these ought to be a source
of great pride and satisfaction on the part
of all true Canadians. The first is the
increased value of the Canadian dollar on
the markets of the world. Our dollar not
only bas reached parity with its American
counterpart, but has even surpassed it. I hope
that never again when Canadians cross over
from Windsor to Detroit they will be told with
utter contempt that in value their money is
next to Patagonian currency. The second
fact I wish to mention is the fat surplus
which our Minister of Finance has at his
disposal. Although I share many of the views
expressed by my honourable friend the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) regarding taxation
in a general way, I was quite surprised to
hear him pass such severe remarks upon the
so-called misjudgment of the Minister with
respect to this surplus. After all, it is better
to be unexpectedly rich than unexpectedly
poor.
I have endeavoured so far to recognize,
without any undue exaggeration, most of
the good accomplished by the present
administration, and I have done so without
any fiattery or excessive partisanship. To
prove to everybody that I have been sincere
in this endeavour, I shall now offer a bit of
constructive criticism with an equal honesty
of purpose and an equal desire to be helpful
to those who are responsible to Canada for
her general peace, contentment and everincreasing prosperity. May I be permitted
from this moment on to address the bouse in
my own language, so that I may be more
explicit and remain within the scope of my
argument? I hope no one in this chamber
will believe that I now choose to speak in
French in order not to be understood by
the large majority of my colleagues, who do

SENATE

not know that language. Such an impression would be ridiculous, in fact, because
many of my English-speaking friends-such
as the honourable senators from Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard), Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
iHugessen) and Saint Boniface (Hon. Mr.
Davis)enjoy the privilege of knowing
equally well the two official languages of the
country, and also because this speech, like all
other speeches delivered in French, will be
published in English, after a delay of only
a day or two, in the Official Report of the
Debates.
<Translation):
Honourable senators, although my name is
neither Lief Ericson, Christopher Columbus,
John Cabot, nor Jacques Cartier, I have just
discovered a new land on this North American
continent, and my discovery is so sensational
that I can no longer wait to break the news of
it to my colleagues of the Senate of Canada.
This vast region is bounded to the north by
the Arctic Ocean and the polar ice fields,
to the east by the Labrador and what our
contemporary geographers have agreed to call
the maritime provinces, to the south, by the
enormous eastern expansion of the republic
beyond the 45th parallel, and to the west
by my own province of Ontario.
This
marvellous territory, which abounds in mineral deposits and where the soil lends itself
particularly well to the growing of fodder
and to market gardening, is crossed diagonally by a shining silver belt, to which some
unknown cartographer gave the name of St.
Lawrence. Because of the latter, this region
has often, itself, been called in French, "la
Laurentie." It is also known as the Quebec
Reserve, which is not a new term but one
which current events make most topical.
In common with the adjacent country which
surrounds it, both east and west, this land has
two parliamentary chambers, the higher one
being the Legislative Council, and the lower
one the Legislative Assembly. It also has-but
in this it differs from its east-west neighbours
-its own distinctive flag, on the folds of
which shine out the symbols of its origin.
Strange to say, its inordinately long boundary
lines have not yet been strewn with immigration offices or customs sentries, except in so
far as it was necessary to restrict the altogether too free distribution of that hapless
commodity, margarine!
Everybody understands to which one of the
Canadian provinces I just referred, but I want
to explain now why I went into such a fanciful description.
The good old province of Quebec, which
I hail with filial emotion, is my native
province and I did not know I had moved

from one country to another when, as a young
professional man of 23 I settled in the province of Ontario . . . or Upper Canada.

Still

that is the impression I got recently when the
old age pension cheques were issued. They
all carried the federal government crest but
were printed in French and English for the
pensioners of the proverbial "Reserve" and in
English only for the pensioners of the other
provinces.
I hope others realize as I do the illogical,
absurd and altogether ridiculous position in
which the government placed itself when it
decided to ignore the existence of the million French-speaking Canadians who live
outside Quebec's Great Wall, and this for the
second time in two or three years, as it had
already made the same mistake on distributing the first Family Allowance cheques. But
this time, as it had received numerous and
solemn warnings two months before the
famous cheques were issued, there was not
the same excuse. Why should the necessity
for Canadian unity be proclaimed on every
occasion while, at the same time, barriers are
raised between the "Quebec Reserve" and the
other provinces? And why should this colossal
blunder continue, notwithstanding the thousands of protests, individual and collective, which have been sent to the government
for the last two or three months? Can the
true authors of this stupid anomaly not hear
the cry of popular indignation and of general
resentment caused by the fact that, in this
constitutionally and tradit'onally bilingual
country, they have officially ignored the rights
of the minority? It was to this indignation
that I wanted to give voice today, and who
would dare say that, in so doing, I am not
fulfilling my duty as an authorized representative in this house of the aggrieved
minorities.
I am aware, Mr. Speaker, that one of our
rules forbids members of this house from
making direct and personal attacks upon
members of the other place, but, as far as I
know, there is nothing to prevent a senator
from standing up for a colleague, either here
or elsewhere, when he feels that he has been
too bitterly attacked; and that is exactly what
I propose doing presently.
The government's position, regarding the
question I have just mentioned seems so
untenable, and even so provocative to me, that
I cannot convince myself that the decision to
issue those -cheques was unanimous among
its members. I am rather inclined to believe
that there must have been quite a heated discussion within the Cabinet over this matter.
Apparently, it was the advice of the foolhardy
-to say the least-which prevailed, and now
the whole government is being blamed for

Rapids Section. Consequently, in order to
develop the St. Lawrence seaway it is necessary to have the approval of the United
States.
The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin is a
vast drainage system covering 678,000 square
miles, 493,000 of which are in Canada and
185,000 in the United States. It includes Lake
Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake
St. Claire, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
The main points where electrical energy is
to be developed are: (1) St. Mary's Falls,
lying between Lake Superior and Lake Huron,
where there is a drop of 21 feet; (2) the St.
Clair Detroit passage, joining Lake Huron and
Lake Erie, where the drop is 8 feet; (3) the
Niagara River, which connects Lake Erie with
Lake Ontario, where there is a drop of 326
feet between the mean levels of Lake Erie
and Lake Ontario; (4) the portion of the St.
Lawrence River which includes the International Rapids section, Lake St. Francis and
the Soulanges section, and the Lachine section, with a drop of 225 feet; and (5) the portion from Montreal to the ocean, which lies
wholly in Canadian territory and has a drop of
20 feet. This in all comprises a drop of 580
feet from the head of the Great Lakes to the
Atlantic ocean, a distance of about 2,000
miles.
It is estimated these five steps will develop
9,000,000 horsepower of electric energy. All
this power is in Canada with the exception of
1,800,000 horsepower at Niagara and the
American share of 1,100,000 horsepower in the
International Rapids section. So much for the
St. Lawrence Seaway.
Now, coming closer to home-the Maritime
Provinces and particularly Prince Edward
Island. What can be done to level out the
natural and artificial disabilities under which
these provinces labour? What can be done to
stimulate industrial activity, to develop our
vacant lands, to increase our population, to
increase the income of the people of the
Maritimes to the Canadian level, and to enable
this section of Canada to maintain its proper
place in the building of an ever expanding
Canada?
In the first place, we should not be
envious of the great resources of our neighbours; we should rejoice with them and do
everything possible for the national development of natural resources, with the realization
that progress in this directon ultimately should
benefit all the partners in the Confederation.
I do not think the people of the Maritime
Provinces would object very strongly to the
St. Lawrence Seaway. I think they would take
a broader view and realize that this important
project is in keeping with vast progress that
has been made by this great country of ours.

No doubt the development of the seaway and
the vast amount of electrical energy connected
therewith would attract more manufacturing
establishments from the United States and
elsewhere. This would mean increased employment, in population and in consumption
of agricultural products from all of which
Prince Edward Island would benefit.
The Island is sometimes called the millionacre farm, the Garden of the Gulf; and
agriculture plays the predominating role in
the economy of the province, accounting for
at least 50 per cent of the gross value
of its entire production.
Though that production is small if compared with the great production of the Prairies
and the Central Provinces, where the great
bulk of Canada's agricultural output originates, nevertheless Prince Edward Island has
taken the lead in many branches of agriculture. For instance, it produces a larger
percentage of grade A bacon hogs than any
other province. The Island now ships carloads of breeding stock to most of the other
provinces and United States. It was the
first province to introduce the systematic
grading of dressed poultry and one of the
first to introduce egg grading. Its high quality
seed potatoes command a premium in the
markets of many countries.
For many years past Prince Edward Island
has been free from bovine tuberculosis. As a
result, its cattle have been sold at a premium
all over the North American continent, and it
is generaiiy conceded that the island possesses
a livestock population more vigorous and free
of disease than any area in the world. Butter,
cheese, rmilk and cream are produced under
rigid controls. We manufacture approximately
1,000,000 pounds of cheese and 5,000,000
pounds of butter annually, of a gross value
of $3,000,000.
With regard to potatoes, for which the
Island is famous, and which is the chief cash
crop for our farmers, every effort has been
made to eliminate diseases and produce only
top quality. From a reorganization of the
industry in 1920, as a result of experimental
work with new varieties, there has emerged
a vigorous industry which now exports from
four to six million hundredweight of potatoes
yearly and supplies seed stocks to thirty of

kets. The value of this crop in the five years
from 1946 to 1950 was approximately
$33,000,000, and the total value of feed crops
in the same period was $98,000,000.
The prices the farmer receives for potatoes
vary considerably from year to year. For
instance, the cash income for 1949 was

$8,520,000 and in 1950 it feil to $2,940,000, a along titis line would be beneficial to the

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Hawkins was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.
EASTER ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before we adjourn I wish to give the house as
much information as I can about the forthcoming Easter recess. As honourable senators
know, the House of Commons is likely to
adjourn for Easter from April 9 to April 21.
For the Senate I have two possible dates to
propose. The first is the same as that for the
other house, April 9.
Then if later on I see no reason why it will
be necessary for us to meet here on Tuesday
and Wednesday, April 8 and 9, I shall ask
the Senate to adjourn on Thursday, April 3.
I wish to make it clear that at the moment I
know of no particular reason why we should
not be able to adjourn on that date, but
experience has taught me from time to time
that occasionally
something
unforeseen
develops at the last minute before a date
proposed for adjournment, and we have to
continue our sittings in order that certain
legislation may be passed and given the
Royal Assent.
On whatever date we do adjourn, I intend
to move that we stand adjourned until Tuesday, April 29. As soon as I can give more
definite information as to the date on which
the adjournment will begin, I shall be only
too happy to do so.

Hon. Arthur Marcotie: Honourable senators,
with consent of the house I should like to
make a few remarks. A few years ago, when
the Senate took its Easter adjournment, it
was the custom to allow us travelling expenses between Ottawa and our places of residence, or wherever else we went at that time.
Suppose, for instance, that any of us, on doctor's orders or for any other reason, decided
to go somewhere for a vacation at Easter, our
travelling expenses were allowed. Today,
however, we cannot claim a refund of any
money spent for travelling at Easter beyond
the cost of the trip home, if we do go there.
I think that is most unfair.
One more point. I have been a senator now
for more than twenty years, and when I
first came here I was surprised to find myself
entitled to an allowance of $15 a day for
travelling expenses. Yet, notwithstanding the
big increase that there has been in the meantime in the cost of transportation, meals and
so on, that allowance has not been raised.
Is that fair?
I should like to have the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) take up with
the proper authorities the two points that I
have raised. I do feel that the d'aily allowance
for travelling expenses should be raised, and
that we should be entitled to the allowance
if we travel more than 400 miles away from
Ottawa during the Easter adjournment,
regardless of whether we go to our homes;
at that time or not.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March
25 at 8 p.m.

SENATE
STANDING COMMITTEES

INCREASE IN MEMBERSHIP-MOTION
Hon. Mr. Robertson moved:
That the rules of the Senate be amended by
striking out paragraphs 5, 17, and 19 of rule 78
and substituting therefor the following:
"5. The Committee on Transport and Communications, composed of fifty senators."
"17. The Committee on Finance, composed of
fifty senators."
"19. The Committee on Extirnal Relations, cornposed of thirty-five senators.'

He said: Honourable scnators, the action
proposed in this motion is a direct reversal
of the action taken by this house some six
months ago when, as a result of a motion by
myself, we reduced the membership of three
of our standing committees. At that time the
membership of the Committee on Transport
and Communications was reduced from fifty
to seventeen, that of the Finance Committee
from fifty to seventeen, and that of the
External Relations Committee from thirtyfive to seventeen. The purpose of the motion
now before the house is to restore the memberships of these three standing committees.
Honourable senators may recall that I introduced my earlier motion with the object of
giving some of our standing committees an
opportunity to deal with certain legislation
before it reached this house, and in order
that these three committees might approximate more closely the size of our special
committees, I suggested that we reduce the
membership of each of them te seventeen.
At that time some honourable senators
doubted the wisdom of my motion, and I
believe in due course a recorded vote was
tak'en.
I stated more than once during the debate
that perhaps the debate itself had influenced
me somewhat, but nevertheless I assured the
house that if after a trial of the reduced
memberships it was considered wise to restore
the committees to their former size, I would
move that this be done.
It may be recalled that, for reasons beyond
their control, two of the committees did not
sit at all last session. The third one, the
Committee on Transport and Communications, met several times, and the attendance
was good.
When the Selection Committee was at its
work at the beginning of this session the
point was raised that, as a result of last
year's resolution, the strength of each of
these committees was still only seventeen. I
suggested to the Selection Committee that
we nominate seventeen members for each of
these standing committees, and that the
chairman of each, when reporting to the
house, might draw attention to the fact that

only seventeen members had been nominated, thus providing an opportunity to discuss
the matter and find out the wish of the
Senate. Subsequently, and before the Selection Committee's report was adopted, I had
occasion to consult with a very representative group of senators, ircluding the chairmen of the three committLes concerned, and
the consensus of opinion among those whom
I consulted was that a membership of seventeen was too small and that the number
should be increased.
There was not, perhaps, the same unanimity of opinion as to what the increased
membership for each of the committees
should be. I think it was generally held that
the Transport and Communications should
have fifty members.
Prior te the time at which I came to the
Senate-as may be recalled by senators who
were here then-this committee was known
as the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, and I believe that for
legislative purposes it was used perhaps
more than the Banking and Commerce Committee has been used in recent years. In any
event, those two committees were the principal ones to which bills were referred for
study. I believe the senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) pointed out that there
was indeed a time when the membership of
the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours was larger than that of the Banking and Commerce Committee. In any event,
there does not seem to be much doubt that
the general wish is to have the Transport
Committee composed of fifty members.
Now I shall refer to the other two committees. When I first became government
leader the Committee on Finance had thirtyfive members. It may be recalled that just
about that time the size of most ýcommittees
was increased, and Finance was given fifty
members. I think that at the same time the
membership of the External Relations Committee was increased from twenty-five to
thirty-five.
There is some difference of
opinion among senators whom I have con-

sulted as to whether these committees should
now be given fifty and thirty-five members
respectively. Therefore, in the absence of
any clear view on the point, I have thought
it best to recommend to the house that the
committees be restored to their former size;
and if in due course it should appear desirable to reduce the membership of either, or
both, that question could be considered later.
That, honourable senators, is in substance my
explanation of the motion.
Perhaps I may be permitted to mention one
other point which, though not directly bearing on the subject, does have some relation

MARCH 25, 1952
to it. Honourable senators who were present
at the organization meeting may remember
that there was some discussion about the
manner in which members were selected for
such senior committees as Banking and Commerce, and Transport and Communications,
to which most of our legislation is referred
for consideration and the hearing of witnesses.
From time to time different senators, particularly among the more recent appointees
to the house, have asked if they might be
made members of the Banking and Commerce Committee, for instance, and I have
explained that when the Selection Committee
makes its report, shortly after the beginning
of each session, it usually nominates the full
number of members for the various committees. Generally speaking, appointments have
been made on the basis of seniority and
geography; and vacancies have been filled as
they occurred. I have been asked if it was
not true that some senior members found it
inconvenient to attend certain committee
meetings. Of course it is true that the attendance varies, not only in Senate committees
but in committees set up outside parliament.
I have given considerable thought to the
question of whether it is not possible to
improve on the procedure adopted by the
Selection Committee, and to that end I have
a suggestion to make. So that there will be
no misunderstanding, I have written down
precisely the thought I have in mind, and
when I have stated it I shall elaborate a
little as to how it would work out. First,
I would remind honourable members that
this is not a motion but, as I have said, a
suggested change of policy, which I have
discussed with some honourable senators, including members of the Seleetion
Committee.
My suggestion is that at the beginning of
each session the Selection Committee, in its
first report, nominate for each of the large
standing committees approximately twothirds of its full membership, leaving the
balance to be selected in the light of express
requests by individual members. In preparing its first report the Selection Committee
should be guided by the previous membership list and should take for a committee
those who have displayed the greatest
interest in the work of that committee by
attending its sessions. If I may elaborate a
little, by way of illustration, I will attempt
to show how the new arrangement would
work out. In the past, in setting up the
Standing Committees on Banking and Commerce and on Transport and Communications, for instance, the Selection Committee
has shown in its initial report practically the
full membership. There were a few exceptions-on the Transport Committee, I think,
55708-7

and some others-where four or five
vacancies were left so that if new senators
were appointed before new committees were
struck there would be vacancies to which
they could be appointed. Under the suggested procedure the Committee of Selection
could meet, as it now does, within a few
days after the opening of the bouse, and
appoint thirty-five of the fifty members of
one of the main standing committees. The
chairman, in presenting his initial report,
could perhaps point out that these thirty-five
members had been appointed on the basis of
the interest they had shown in the work of
the committee, and that another meeting of
the Selection Committee would take place
within a period of perhaps two weeks. This
lapse of time would allow honourable senators, who so desired, to make application to
become members of the committee. The
Whips on both sides of the house could be
present at the second meeting, and all senators who wished to join could be named to
fil the fifteen vacancies. If there were more
than fifteen applicants it would be necessary
for the Selection Committee to judge the
relative merits of the applicants.
I can foresee no great difflculty in this,
-and unless there are representations to the
conîtrary, or I hear something in the discussion which causes me to change my mind,
I shall suggest that this policy be adopted
in future by the Selection Committee, so
that those interested in becoming members
of a committee may have an opportunity to
do so if others feel unable to continue to
serve.
The other point I want to make relates to
the resolution on the order paper as it affects
individual committees. If the resolution is
adopted this evening, the question will arise,
how soon can additions to the membership
be made? The matter is of some urgency
in respect of the first two committees; as
regards the third, immediate action is not
so important. A meeting of the Committee
on Transport and Communications has been
cailed for tomorrow; and the Chairman of
the Committee on Finance would like to
.have his committee meet as soon as possible. As honourable senators know, the
Selection Committee has given some thought
to additional members of these committees
if this resolution should be approved by the
bouse. I suggest that the principle I have
outlined as applicable next session might be
put in force at once, for we shall be adding
thirty-three members each to the Committee
on Transportation and Communications and
the Committee on Finance. Up to the present, three senators who are not members of

SENATE

the Transport and Communications Committee have intimated that they would like
to be appointed to it. Apart from this, the
Selection Committee have had no indication
as to senators' preferen'ces. The Selection
Committee had before it a record of attendances in the ýpast two years, and were influenced in their nominations by this evidence
as to those who displayed the greatest interest in the committees' work.
I have this suggestion to offer, but shall
not urge unless it receives the complete
approval of the house.
At this time the membership of the Committee on Transport and Communications
consists of seventeen appointed and two ex
officio members. The list has been gone
over in anticipation of the motion before
the Senate being carried this evening. Under
ordinary circumstances action would follow
as soon as the Selection Committee would
meet; but if the Transport Committee is to
meet tomorrow morning there will not be
much time, and I have suggested, and the
Selection Committee has tentatively agreed,
that to this number of seventeen there be
added twenty, ad interim, making a total of
The membership will then
thirty-seven.
include the three honourable senators who
have asked to be added, and seventeen others
who in times past have most regularly
attended the committee's meetings. There
wi1l remain thirteen vacancies, which need
not be filled until after the adjournment, so
that there will be full opportunity to find
out which honourable senators are interested
in joining the committee.
The same course has been adopted with
regard to the Committee on Finance. At
present it consists of seventeen members. We
have selected fifteen others, bringing the
total to thirty-two. If this recommendation
is accepted, there will remain eighteen vacancies which may be filled by other honourable
senators who would like to sit on that committee. If and when the house gives approval
to the motion to increase the strength of the
committees, we might revert to the Order
"Reports of Committees", whereupon the
Chairman of the Selection Committee willmove that twenty honourable senators, whose
names will be read, be added to the Committee on Transport and Communications.
But to enable the committee so constituted to
begin its work tomorrow, the Senate must
change the practice of aliowing the report
to stand for a day. I leave the matter to the
judgment of the house.

to facilitate the formation of committees
in the way that has been suggested. It seems
to me that we are labouring the question too
much. There is a Selection Committee which
now has the power to appoint from among
the persons who are qualified to sit
in this chamber. That commit-tee will meet
tomorrow morning: let it do so, and select
the required number. If any honourable
senator does not want to serve, he can tell
the committee "I am not anxious to serve; put
sornebody else on it." It is, I believe, most
unusual for honourable senators to canvass
the leader or to debate among themselves as
to how they shall get on a committee.
Appointments are made on the basis of
experience and of work done. The only
thing I object to in my leader's statement is
that he was making a suggestion, not a
motion, that it might be arranged at the
first of the session to select forty-three members and, leave seventeen seats vacant so
that some individual or some group might
canvass the situation.
Although I have no objection to this proposal being put into effect this year, I do
not think it should become a precedent.
The Selection Committee should be established in the ordinary routine of business,
and when it meets, those who are anxious
to serve on committees will undoubtedly make
their desires known; and the leader and the
committee, using their best judgment, will
frorn the material available to them, select
the personnel of the committees on the basis
of ability and wi'llingness to serve. But let
us not labour this matter further. I hope that
next year the Selection Committee will itself
make all the appointments, and I am satisfied
that if it does so there will be no complaints.

Hon. Thomas Reid: May I, as a comparative newcomer to the Senate, say a word with
regard to this motion? There is no doubt that
the work of our committees is the most
important work we are doing. It is too bad
that so much of it is carried on behind closed
doors, and that therefore it receives no
publicity.
On one point I am inclined to disagree with
the honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King), and to agree with the government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who
said that some regard should be paid to
attendance. If there are honourable senators
who do not want to work on the committees
they should not feel annoyed if they are not
reappointed. Speaking for myself, I have
always taken a keen interest in committee
work, and if I am wanted I shall do my best

MARCH 25, 1952
Committee: I arn beginning to think that to
belong to that committee one has to be well
on in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Special privilege!
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wanted to be on that coinmittee. But no, I arn left out. I ar n ot coinplaining about that, but I would stress this
matter of attendance, because if there are
some members of the committee who have
flot attended even one meeting, there is no
reason why they should flot be relieved of
membership and have their places taken by
others who want to do the work? Since Iliave
been here rnost of our legisiation has been
referred to the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee. I do flot complain bitterly about flot
having been appointed to it, but 1 repeat that,
as there are members who have neyer
attended one meeting, it is time they were
dropped. What ground of complaint could
they have? If I do flot attend a comrnittee,
strike me off and I will flot complain. How
could any senator complain under such circumstances? It seems that when a member
has been here long enough he is automatically
chosen to serve on our special committees.
WeUl, many of us newcomers do flot agree
with that idea, and I arn frank to say that
I for one do flot. There is a great deal of
menit in the proposai of the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson). The committees
should be set Up and those members who do
flot; attend should be stricken off the membership list until they ask to be reinstated.
Hon. Mr. King: The Selection Cominittee
can have that information before it when it
meets for the purpose of making appointments. Members who do not wish to attend
certain committees can say'so.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
approximately a dozen senators sit daily on
the Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Aseltine: We do not; work a three
or a five-day week. We work six days a
week, so at times it is quite impossible for
us to attend the meetings of other committees.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would except members
who serve on the Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We commence work at
10.30 ini the morning and continue until we
inish, whatever time !i the day it may be.
Therefore, in rny capacity o! Chairman o! the
Divorce Committee I should like to be consulted. before anyone is dropped from our
Standing Committees. I should like to advise
the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the other
memibers of the Selection Committee o! the
feelings of the members of the Divorce Cornmittee in this regard.
55708-7&

Hon. Mr. Robertson: As the honourable
gentleman from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
is a member of the Selection Cornmittee, I
give hlm my undertaking that we shal flot
proceed with this matter until he is present,
at the meeting.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senator, wheïa
I made xny remarks about those who doflot attend cormmittee meetings I was notthinking o! the members of the Divorce Committee. I have a great deal o! respect for,
the gentlemen who serve on that committee.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, 1
believe I have been a member of the Selection
Committee since I was first called to the
Senate. I do not usually agree with my honourable friend from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King), but I honestly do flot; think there should
be any canvassing of the members of the
Selection Committee in order that this or that
person may be put on any committee. For
one thing, I do not believe it is in keeping
with the dignity of this chamber. If we
do not appoint the proper members to the
Selection Comxnittee, it is our own fault. If
the honourable senators from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), Sheiburne (Hon. Mn. Robertson), Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), Ottawa (Hon. Mn.
Lambert), Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn>
and others do flot choose the right men to,
serve on the Senate committees, others
should be appointed toi make the selection.
I agree with the leader of the governent
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) that we are faced with
a problem. Some members, after serving
faithfully on a committee for five or ten years,
may become ill, and you do not like to drop
them from a committee, because they may
again be able to serve on it later. It is flot
necessary for all the members of a committee
to be present in order that it shall make decisions based on sound judgment. I hope the
honourable gentleman from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) will accept the suggestion of
the honourable leader and allow these new
names to be added to the membership of the
Transport Committee, because tomorrow
morning that committee will have to deal
with certain legisiation.
Our Finance Committee has done a wonderful job, thanks to its chairman (Hon. Mn.
Crerar).
Soma Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He has brought great credit
to the Senate, and oun Canadian newspapers,
irrespective of their political. leanings, accept
his financial report without question. People
may wonder whether the Senate does any
work, but one thing they do know is that it

SENATE
brings out a good financial report. The Chairman of the Finance Committee has some good
ideas, and I think his committee should be
allowed to get under way without any delay
so that arrangements can be made during our
lEaster recess to obtain any statistical data
which the members of the committee would
like to have. I am sure, too, that honourable
:senators would like to get the major portion
of their committee work completed before the
warm summer weather comes. I hope that
the motion of the honourable leader opposite
will be agreed to tonight, so that during the
next two weeks the Transport Committee and
the Finance Committee can clean up whatever legislation comes before them. Then
people will not be able to accuse the Senate
of leaving things undone when it takes a
three-weeks recess at Easter. I would strongly
urge that the house adopt the motion.
Hon. Mr. King: I have already consented
to that.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: It is proposed that the
Committee on Transport and Communications shall be composed of fifty members,
though at the present time there are only
about ninety members of this house. This
will mean that the Transport and Communications Committee will be comprised of more
than half of the whole Senate membership.
Notices of several committee meetings for
tomorrow have been handed out, and each
honourable member has to decide which
committee he will attend. My point is that
there can be no concentration of effort if
there are fifty members serving on each of
our heavy committees.
ýIt is the quorum that presents the difficulty in the operation of a committee. I do
not find any particular fault with a committee having a large membership, but for
the purposes of holding meetings I think
the quorum should be relatively small. We
should try to be specialists in certain fields
and not attempt to cover everything. If an
honourable senator does a good job on one
or two committees he will be making a
worth-while contribution to the work of the
Senate. For instance, the chairman and
members of the Divorce Committee do a
good job. If honourable senators are faced
with the problem of deciding which one of
several committees they will attend, they
will most likely choose the most interesting
one, and as a result the more arduous work
of other conimittees may suffer. I think
there was considerable virtue in what was
tried out last year. I feel that the people
who attend committees and do the work
should be selected, but it must be borne

in mind that one can attend only one conimittee at a time, and that concentration
brings the best results.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
The motion was agreed to.

PRIME MINISTER OF CEYLON
EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators will have learned with the deepest
regret of the tragic death of the Prime Minister of Ceylon, the Right Honourable Don
Stephen Senanayake.
His loss will be felt throughout the British
Commonwealth and, indeed, the whole free
world, no less than in his own country.
The late Prime Minister served Ceylon
faithfully and with the greatest distinction
for almost a third of a century, and it was
under his leadership that Ceylon attained
dominion status in 1948, becoming a member
of the Commonwealth of Nations. As an
interpreter of Asia Prime Minister Senanayake gave counsel that was invaluable, and
the lack of his firm dedication to democratic
principles will constitute a loss which the free
world as a whole will feel keenly. To the

MARCH 25, 1952
members of the late Prime Minister's family,
and to his people, we extend our deepest
sympathy.
I beg to move, seconded by the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), that we in
this chamber rise and stand for a moment in
respectful silence.
Honourable senators rose and stood in their
places.
FINANCE COMMITTEE
REPORT CONCURRED IN

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
COMMITTEE
REPORT CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the first report of the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this report stands in the same position as the
one just adopted. The report recommends that
the quorum of the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications be reduced to
seven. I understand that heretofore when
the membership of the committee was fifty
the quorum was nine, and I expect to submit to the house later on a further report
recommending that the quorum be increased
to that number. At present, though, I am
moving that the report before us be concurred
in now, so that the committee may be able
to get to work tomorrow morning.
The motion was agreed to.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March

Hon. Charles G. Hawkins: Honourable
senators, first I wish fo congratulate the

SENATE

(Hon. Mr. Gouin), of the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne, upon their
excellent contributions to the debate. Their
speeches drew our attention to the very
buoyant condition of our affairs here in
Canada, and it is regrettable that world
conditions make it imperative that we appropriate such a large portion of our wealth and
effort to the problems of defence. Under
existing conditions we have no alternative,
as the first responsibility of government is
to assure to its people the permanency of
their institutions and way of life, and the
first step in this direction is preparedness. I
feel that the vast majority of the citizens
of this country are ready to meet this challenge and to accept the sacrifices necessary
to do so.
The record of Canada's progress during
the first half of the century reads almost
like a fairy tale. Upon examining that progress we find that it has been general in
many fields of endeavour; but on reviewing
the reasons for this spectacular advance
during recent years, it will be noted that
while many factors have contributed to
this happy position, not the least of which
is the industry, stability and integrity of our
people, we are bound to admit that nature has
most generously endowed this land, and much
of our wealth, real and potential, is, or will
be, the result of this heritage.
Both the diversity and the volume of these
great natural resources could easily lead us
to believe that they are inexhaustible; and
by reason of the vastness of our territory
we could easily become prodigal in their
development and utilization. The great land
mass of the northern part of this continent
can give to many the impression that we
have little need to be concerned with our own
future.
If we agree that one of the reasons for the
good life -we enjoy is the result of a bountiful
Creator, it might be well for us to make
a mental inventory of our legacies.
Our agricultural development has advanced
far beyond the needs of our own people, and
makes a substantial contribution to the needs
of those less fortunate than ourselves. We
produce in abundance many of the staple
foodstuffs necessary to human existence and
health. While our policy in this field has
been progressive, and a great deal is being
done to guarantee the continued productivity
of our soil, much remains to be achieved.
Notwithstanding our great development in
this field, agriculture presents many problems,
and our greater production of foodstuffs could
well make a great contribution to world
peace and stability.

Many say that our vast mineral deposits
have scarcely been scratched, and that is
probably correct; but honourable senators,
these treasures once removed are gone forever, and it should be our responsibility to
see that future generations are assured of a
fair share of these reserves.
Again, we have been most grievously
unaware of the great possibilities of our
fisheries. The maritime portion of our country
is closely adjacent to some of the world's
best fishing grounds, and practically the
whole inland area is well served with fresh
water lakes and streams, many of which
still abound with excellent food fish.
We produce more of this commodity than
we need for ourselves, but already there are
indications that many of the more desirable
varieties of edible fish are less plentiful than
heretofore. I realize too that many of the
prolific fishing areas are beyond our control,
and I submit that we should be seriously
concerned with the conservation and perpetuation of this great source of food supply.
Honourable senators, not the least of our
great sources of wealth is our forests. They,
unlike our mineral resources, can continue
to render to mankind tremendous service if
we exercise adequate care for their protecMoreover, unlike
tion and utilization.
returns from agriculture, which generally
speaking are largely the result of personal
effort, sustained yields from the forest can
only be accomplished by long-term planning. Our generation has a responsibility
to at least maintain this great national asset
at as high a iproductive level as that at which
we found it.
Without going into detail, let me mention
some of the contributions the forest makes
to our national life and income. It is the
source of raw material for our great lumber,
paper and fibre industry. Of course, this is
evident and known to you all; but further,
our great hydro electrical development,
which has contributed so much to our wealth
and comfort, would be greatly handicapped,
and in many instances unable to function, if
our watersheds were denuded. A great many
of our game and fur-bearing animals depend
on the forest for their existence. Most of our
edible inland fish depend for their food on
stream's and lakes that are nurtured and protected by adequate forest cover. Forests
are the most efficient and adequate flood control factor known to man, and in many ways
contribute to the prevention of soil erosion
and many other problems which confront
agriculture. The recreational possibilities of
the forests are practically unlimited, and

MARCH 25, 1952
life in the forested outdoors tends to make
for a fuller lif e, especially among our youth.
It is said that Canada has the greatest
remaining coniferous forest area in the free
world. This statement could easily tend to
make us feel secure, and might even tend to
smugness. But the fact remains that even
if this is true, no one can say with surety
whether our depletion exceeds our growth.
Some maintain that all is well, while no less
an authority than the Canadian Forestry
Association predicted in 1949, that, under
existing extraction methods, Canada's supply of merchantable timber 'would disappear
in sixty years. I submit that 'both predictions are merely guesses, and suggest that
neither of them is based on factual information.
I fully realize that the title to and administration of most of our forest lands is vested
in the provinces, but I alsd feel that the
nation as a whole has a heavy responsibility to conserve a natural resource which
contributes in such substantial degree to
our national wea'lth and way of life.
My own province, Nova Scotia, has legislation controlling cutting on both public and
privately owned land within the province,
and while at the time of its introduction this
was a very controversial subject, it is now
generally accepted by both private landowners and the public generally as a very
progressive step.
More recently, the Minister of Resources
and Development, Honourable R. H. Winters,
proposed legislation that was passed, the
object of which was to co-operate with the
provinces in furthering the better utilization,
conservation and protection of this great
national asset. Further, many of the woodusing industries, now concerned about their
sources of supply, are appropriating substantial sums to conduct research into extraction, utilization and regeneration.

All of these activities by their very nature
are long-term undertakings, and demand, if
they are to be productive and effective, the
endorsement of the public generally. If the
people are fully informed of the possibilities
and benefits of such programmes to their
future welfare, I feel we can be assured of
their whole-hearted support.
Now, honourable senators, it has often
been said in this chamber that it was intended
as a place of sober, second thought. This
suggests that we should be the guardians of
the rights and privileges of both present and
future generations. The problems I have
attempted to outline to you in connection
with the utilization of our natural resources
demand intensive study and review; further,
they are the concern of the whole nation. In
fact, I might suggest that this be a subject of
investigation by a special group of this house,
or it could well be referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources.
This house, made up as it is of members
from all parts of Canada, being representatives of the professional, economie and cultural life of the nation, should be eminently
qualified to make such continuing investigations; and if it should embark on such a venture, I suggest that it would make a worthwhile contribution not only to the present
generation, but to those who will follow us.
If we are to continue to maintain our position among the nations of the free world, I
believe it is vital that we take prompt and
definite steps to assure those who follow
ample opportunity to fulfil the great destiny
that a bountiful Providence has made available to us.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators, I

SENATE
that before the accounts of the next fiscal
year are closed out, the total expenditures
will run very close to $5 billion. If that were
the total load the Canadian people were
asked to carry, I would say it probably would
be well within their means to carry it; but
to that we must add the taxes levied by provincial governments and municipal organizations right across Canada. I venture to say
that for the coming year the grand total of
expenditures by all our governments will be
in excess of $6 billion.
It is interesting to note, as was disclosed
in our reports of the last two years, that the
total of all expenditures in 1939 was $1 billion and 35 million. So we have travelled a
long distance in the last fourteen years.
This brings up a question which the committee may find it worth while to inquire
into. I refer to the ability of our people to
carry this huge burden of taxation. I admit
that there would not be much need for worry
if we could accept the rather easy-going
assumption that we shall have a steadily
expanding economy; but we have enjoyed
extraordinarily prosperous conditions since
the end of the war, and we have no guarantee
that these conditions will continue or be
accelerated. Canada's economy is vulnerable
in the sense that our abounding prosperity
depends in large measure on our ability to
find foreign markets for the great variety of
products that we produce in this country. If
it should happen that conditions in the rest
of the world should operate against our finding these markets, then we can expect to
see a decline in the value of our exports,
accompanied by unemployment and all the
difficulties which naturally will follow. We
are conscious today of the economic difficulties that exist in international affairs because
of the very stringent regulations which Great
Britain and the so-called sterling areas have
been obliged to impose against imports from
the so-called dollar areas. And we must not
forget that we are one of the great dollar
areas.
If we cannot find markets for our products,
what will be the effect on our economy? I
submit that these are questions that we, as
parliamentarians, should be giving some
thought to. We have witnessed what has
happened in recent weeks to our livestock
industry which, in large measure, is dependent
on the United States market. This difficulty
has arisen because of the outbreak of the
foot-and-mouth disease in Saskatchewan; and
for the time being-and probably for several
months to come-our market in the United
States for livestock products is wholly cut
off. What effect has this had on our livestock industry? Anyone who follows the

livestock markets knows that since the outbreak of this disease the United States have
imposed embargoes-and no one can criticize
them for doing so-as a result of which the
market value of our livestock on the hoof
has declined somewhere around 8 cents a
pound, and may fall still lower. I mention
these facts to my colleagues because I think
they illustrate, as I stated a little earlier,
that our economy is vulnerable because to
a large extent we are dependent on outside
markets. If that is so, what is the path of
wisdom for Canadian governing authorities
to follow?
I am bound to say that I believe our
committee produced a pretty good report last
year. It received favourable notice in the
press and supplied a great deal of useful
information. But I have not been conscious
so far of the fact that it has had any effect
on any of our governing authorities anywhere.
We have had an expansion of federal expenditures because of defence requirements. This
cannot be avoided, but we have had an
equally large expansion of spending by all
the provinces whose budgets I have seen.
I know, too, that some of our city councils
are sitting up late at night trying to figure
out how they can balance their budgets. The
pioblem is one of considerable seriousness,
and if our committee can help solve it, I
think the labours of the committee will be
worthwhile.
I trust my colleagues will forgive me for
indulging in this somewhat desultory talk on
the need of what is proposed by this
resolution.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wonder if the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
would mind answering a question about the
activities of this committee? He has proposed
that the members of the Finance Committee
look into the question of the incidence of taxation upon the varlous income tax groups.
My question is this. Does he envisage the
committee going a little further and looking
into the question of taxation through customs
and excise, which even though a less painful
method of taking taxes than direct taxation
is nevertheless creating a burden on the
people of this country?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In reply to my honourable
friend I would point out that I qualified the
statement I made on that particular aspect
of the authority given in the resolution. I
am not certain how far we can determine
the extent of that burden. I think there is a
good deal of data available which we could
secure and analyse. Quite obviously what
my honourable friend says about the customs
and excise taxes is right. It is a subject that

way. No word of mine could add anythi-ng.
But, honourable senators, I was deeply touched
by the address of the Queen Mother. Speaking of the late King George, she said:
No man had a deeper sense than he of duty and
service, and no man was more full of compassion
for his fellow men. He loved you all, every one
of you, most truly.

And then, at the end of her address, were
these words:
I commend to you our dear daughter; give her
your loyalty and devotion; in the great and lonely
station to which she has been called she will need
your protection and your love.

I know that everyone of us in this country
will respond to that. When we swore allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, we did so not

only from a sense of duty, but with love in
our hearts. And no wonder: we had just had
the opportunity of becoming personally

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: In the departure of our
Governor General, Lord Alexander, we lostto our sorrow-one of the greatest representatives of the Crown that this country has ever
ha.d. He adorned Canada. His fame as a
general will become higher and higher with
the passing of years. History will preserve
the souvenir of his famous advance from
Egypt through North Africa, Sicily and Italy,
when he turned near defeat into the greatest
of victories. One has to go back to Alexander
the Great to find a parallel. Praise for the
other qualities he proved to have while with
us has been given by others in so brilliant a
way that I do not need to add to it. But
there is another matter which appeals to me
for a personal reason. Our former Governor
General was a lover of sports and of youth,
and he preached to our young men and
women the merits of sportsmanship. As you
know, I have always been a devotee of sports.
In this connection there was a curious
coincidence some three years ago. I had
attended "games day" at my old college at
Ste-Therese, and in the evening I addressed
the students on the benefit of sports for the
maintenance of both mental and physical
health, and on the necessity of a better understanding of sportsmanship. The next morning
I read in the Montreal Gazette that on the
previous daýy His Excellency the Governor
General had been at Shawbridge, a few miles
from Ste. Therese, and there had given an
address on the same subject to the young
students spending their holidays on the farm

devoted to their use at that point. The arguments he used were about the same as I had
used. There was of course the difference that
the speaker at Shawbridge spoke with greater
authority. Nevertheless, I was proud of
the coincidence, and the record of it is one
of my cherished souvenirs.
History is in the making this year in
Canada. The appointment, for the first time,
of a Canadian as Governor General is a major
step forward. There may be some difference
of view among Canadians as to whether this
is an opportune time for the change, but there
is unanimous approval of the choice made,
and every one of our citizensi appreciates the
qualities of His Excellency the new Governor
General, who has proven himself to be a great
and deserving Canadian.
We have heard several very good speeches
on the present resolution, but I wish especially
to thank the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) for his timely citations
about the part played by Sir Robert Borden
in securing rights for Canada-rights for
which he had to fight against English and
American opposition. Fortunately, he had the
help of two South Africans, Botha and Smuts,
and finally won for us the right to be represented on the War Council, and later to sign
the treaty of peace. The suggestions which
he made as to the right of the dominions to
appoint native-born governors general were
only suggestions, but the rights he secured
at the time were very important.
The article written in Saturday Night of
March 8 by George Ferguson of the Montreal
Star, contains further interesting facts about
our march forward to the Balfour Declaration in 1926, and to the passage of the Statute
of Westminster in 1931. To cover all the
details of these events would necessitate the
writing of a book, and at that it would not
bring unanimity of appreciation.
Writers
may agree on facts but not on the philosophy
which flows from them. The old Roman
dictum tot capita tot census still stands.
Honourable senators, on January 25 last,
the Prime Minister delivered to the press a
most opportune statement, which deserves
mention and appreciation. I have wondered
why it had not been made before, for this
would have cleared the atmosphere, which
week by week and month by month was
becoming more cloudy. The following paragraphs are taken from that statement:
2. The official name of Canada is Canada. Both
the British North America Act of 1867 and the
Westminster Statute of 1931 say so. In rooting the
term, "Dominion of Canada," from officiai laws and
documents, the government is simply trying to
correct an error that has crept into official usage.
But people who want to wipe out the term "Dominion" entirely, are going too far.

The interchangeableness of words is also an
important consideration. Frequent use of a single
word in one sentence or paragraph gives the effect
of repetitiousness, and hence wearisomeness, of
thought. This is often instantly relieved by the
substitution of an interchangeable word. To make
such interchange discreetly and effectively, one
must know the exact content of each of the words

study of synonyms can impart.

Now we come to the definition of the word
"dominion"; and I am going to refer to the
book this time, because I do not want to be
misquoted or misunderstood:
Dominion, . . . 2. Law.

possession and use; ownership; power of disposal.

commonwealth have been fully equal in status. Ahl
but one are dominions.
The other, the United
Kingdom, is a kingdom. The one word which embraces them all is realm. They are all realms of
the King on an equal footing. The term realm
came from a French word meaning kingdom. The
Liberal government would have no objection to the
term kingdom for Canada, but whether it would be
appropriate to alter the laws to do so is a move
which would have to get consideration.

Let us return to the speech of the seconder
of the motion: what do we read?
Let us remark here that in the royal proclamation issued by the United Kingdom government, we
find neither the word "dominion" nor "empire,"
and that the old style of "British Commonwealth"
has been replaced by "Commonwealth." The most
significant change consists in
the expressions
"Queen of this realm and other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth," which have
been used for the first time In Great Britain. Thus,
in the eyes of the United Kingdom, Canada has
become a realm rather than a dominion. Thus has
been fulfilled the wish of Sir John A. Macdonald,
when he wanted our new-born federation to be
called the "Kingdom of Canada."

Here again you have the word realm, and
this word, so dear to the seconder of the
resolution, so dear to the Prime Minister, is

I have thoughts which lead to doubt and
misgivings, I like to remember those words of
Lincoln, delivered when leaving for the last
time his neighbours at Springfield:
Believing in Him who can go with me and

may confidently expect that all will yet be well.

They are a safe guide in any age and in any
circumstances.
In these days of tension, Great Britain is
receiving ber share of world notice. Age-old
differences are coming to the surface, and
customs long since out-moded are being
recast. In the latter connection letters and
communications from very worthy persons
and organizations have been received. They
fear the severing of British links and the
violation of Canadian traditions. I believe
they are unduly disturbed. On this point,
may I state that three years ago I had the
pleasure and privilege of attending a conference in London? There were present delegates from thirty-seven different countries
formerly regarded as component parts of the
British Empire and now regarded as parts
of the commonwealth. I believe the conference was successful, but I also believe the
success that attended it was due to social
contacts and the expressions of personal opinions rather than to any official debates and
pronouncements. From the latter we were
made conscious of several major constitutional changes: restricted citizenship, the
independence of Eire, of India and of Ceylon,
the attitude of South Africa and resentment
of exploitation in the West Indies. The
change-over in name from the Empire Parliamentary Association te the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Conference holds its own
significance. Politely but pointedly it was
stated in Empire terms that the ascendancy
of the white race was no longer to be suffered
-that if the Empire was not black, at least
it was coloured. By reference to geography
and to population statistics, it will be determined that this statement was made with
factual accuracy. There was some evidence
of strain, but of a fraternal character
expressed in family frankness.
Personally I labour under no delusions. I
do not believe in the divinity of kings, net
even of British kings, after reading their history, nor in the sanctity of princes. Although
the Britain of history may be glamorous,
nevertheless she had her violent and unhallowed past. In this regard I have no national
bias. I accept truth at its pertinent value. I
believe British purges were quite as final as
far as individual victims were concerned as
those of other countries. I make no excuses
to offset the evidence of history. The heads

that hung in Temple Bar were quite unattractive and gory. These are matters on which
the harps of minstrels have broken, and many
other traditions are best left in the limbe of
forgotten memories. The fact that it was a
sufficient defence to plead in an Irish court,
under British jurisdiction, that the victim was
Irish, is one that I could personally dispense
with. There may still be those who claim it
was a rule of law which had much to recommend it, but I plead special interest. It is
only one of the aspects of a less humane and
less enlightened age which are relies of the
past, but relies to which we pay no reverence.
I am not a believer in traditions for the purpose of preserving traditions. I believe society
has a greater and more sacred mission. At
the same time I do not believe in serverance
of British connections, and could find no one
in the conference who entertained any such
purpose.
Even the independent states of Eire, India
and Ceylon believed most firmly in union on
a co-operative basis. This was an agreed and
accepted factor: there was still faith in
instructed leadership.
Ail believed that
Britain had something to offer in world
colonization and outlook not vouchsafed to
other nations, that she played ber mighty
part in world-building commerce and placed
world prosperity and individual living standards on new levels; that in her mature years
at least, ber armies and navies were stabilizing influences in the promotion of world order
and security. Confirmed in the latter opinion,
while they regarded many traditions as
decadent, they could not view the disintegration of the Empire with complacency.
In this country also there are no separatist tendencies. Our sovereign notion, as
aptly and generally expressed, is net to
destroy but to restore to the empire its oldtime energy and vitality, to enable it to play
the part it once played and can again play in
international life. With all its past faults and
all its present imperfections, we prefer to say
of Britain, as Emerson said in 1847, just over
100 years ago:
I see her not dispirited, not weak, but well
remembering that she has seen dark days before.
I see her in her old age, not decrepit but young,
and still daring to believe in her power of endurance and expansion.

Honourable senators, we are severing no
links of empire. We are forging new ones
welded in courage and vigour, in unity of
understanding, in efforts of mutual forbearance and helpfulness. Should we do this
effectively we can be assured that through
co-operative efforts and armed with a common
purpose, our collective peoples will meet the
challenge of our time as the British people

MARCH 26, 1952
in the hour of Britain's glory, and the Canadian people in their rugged and pioneer life,
met the issues of the past.
I notice by reference to the Speech from the
Throne that a war veterans ,act is to be
introduced, designed to show a more generous
recognition of those who served in the armed
forces. In commenting on such a well
deserved and happy announcement, I would
pay a tribute to Canada's sons in the several
wars which have come to us in such tragic
sequence. I think you will all agree that their
valour on many a hard fought field has
set upon their time the seal of immortality.
They met the challenge as we knew they
would, and in every phase of combat conducted
themselves according to the best traditions
of the past. As long as the human record is
kept, their achievements, their devotion to
duty and their sacrifices will live. They gave
to freedom all they had. May this be to us
an example in the present and a stimulation
in the world to be. Many died that their
nation's honour might survive and that to
us might be given the privilege of living in
dignity and security. To these we can pay
no earthly due, but to their dependents, and
to the sacrifices which they too have made,
may this nation pay the tribute of a lasting
and generous memory.
I am happy to see a move in this direction,
and I trust the various boards charged with
the responsibility of administration will observe the spirit of the Act and move forward
with consideration, with sympathy and with
expedition. Absence of the last mentioned
feature is one of the post incidents of war
which in the past has been regarded as an
unhappy sequel to man's loyalty and devotion.
With over thirty years' experience as a member of the Canadian Legion, whose duty it
has been to press veterans' claims for recognition, I can truthfully affirm that pensions
and allowance boards have acted with unfailing courtesy. They have invariably advised
of sympathetic attention. But when the
victim has seen the thumb turned down,
he has failed to observe any overflow of
official kindness. There is a saying in the
Isle of Man that "If you give a pail of milk
don't skim it." The experience I refer to has
demonstrated that few Manxmen are members of the various boards of control, and
has indicated alse that the relative boards
can be relied upon as firm custodians of the
public purse. The responsibility perhaps is
more in routine and procedure.
Notwithstanding the lessons of the past,
many members of the forces engaged in

physical fitness. This feature is seized upon
and referred to as a chargeable responsibility.
Deficiency in -documentation is a further
ground upon which the veteran is presumed te
suffer prejudice. In fact there is a rumour
given a wide measure of credence that service
records of many veterans, especially those
who served in the air arm of the Royal
Air Force, are incomplete. Ironically enough,
the men alleged to be so affected are Canada's
first enlistments, the so-called few to whom
so many owe so much-words of lofty expression meaning so little to so many of them.
They belong to the air force personnel who
fought in the Battle of Britain, in the defence
of Malta and in the earlier desert campaign.
I have in mind many cases, both in the
past and the present, which provoke comment. One was not finalized for at least ten
years. In the interim the serviceman and his
family suffered many privations. Another had
a divorce and domicile feature. The veteran,
crippled in service, was reduced to seeking
municipal aid. A recent case concerns a
flight-lieutenant who enlisted in 1939 and proceeded overseas in December of the same year
with Canada's first contingent. He was
assigned to the Bomber Command of the
Royal Air Force. As a consequence he served
in the Battle of Britain, the defence of Malta
and the Egyptian campaign. Subsequently he
was selected for the Commonwealth Training
Plan, and later returned to active participation
in raids and reconnaissance fiights over Norway and Germany. In all he had 109 operational fiights. Progressively promoted to his
present rank, he was recommended for the
Distinguished Flying Cross, holds the Maltese
Cross, the Egyptian Star, the Golden Wings
with two bars, and other decorations incidental to his protracted service. He served
until the end of hostilities. During the desert
campaign he had two crashes. In neither
case was medical assistance promptly available. In one instance it was a matter of days
before the occupants of the plane got back
to their base. Since demobilization this man
had suffered in health, and his weight had
gone from 198 to 129 pounds. Inasmuch as he
was six foot two and a half inches in stature
his appearance was ghastly. Medical officers
attributed his illness to the crashes mentioned.
The Pensions Board however, witheld assistance, advising that in respect to the crashes
"little of note was cited in his documents".
Since then, I believe, by reference to the
airmen's log, authenticated by his commanding officer and verification obtained from the
British Air Ministry, this feature has been
cleared. But why should such a condition
exist? In point of fact, is there any apprehension that a general insufficiency exists in the
records of such veterans, and to what extent

SENATE
will such a deficiency operate against them in
prosecuting their claims under the Pension
Act? This is a matter which calls for a convincing explanation.
It is not, one must in all fairness concede,
the fault of the Pensions Board. The fault
lies in errors of past omission which render
present delays imperative and bring to the
veteran and his dependents unnecessary and
ungracious hardships and privations. I hope
that such conditions will be rectified. In the
meantime these features cause one to reflect
that pension laws have their special aspects
and limitations. The department involved,
and rightly so as expressing the wish of
the Canadian people, is to be commended for
remedial legislation. The various boards, in
rigid and mechanical efficiency, must use
every conceivable device to guard the public
purse against exploitation; but from the veteran's point of view the picking of daisyheads
in such an indeterminate manner is regarded
as the ungrateful climax to his service and
devotion.
In justice to everyone, the machinery of
investigation needs streamlining in conformity
with present day practices, and in justice to
the veterans in their problems of present day
living.
In paving the way for a sympathetic
approach to the St. Lawrence Seaway project,
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), expressed some concern for the
Maritime Provinces. While his comments
were suggested by the broadi motive of
national expansion, I give the honourable
leader credit for sincerity of interest in
Eastern problems. The honourable senator
from Winnipeg is one of those genial souls
who believes in the Golden Rule as a working
basis in human relations.
The concern
expressed, however, is one to which the
Maritimes have long been a stranger. It is
a concern which many believe was forgotten
immediately subsequent to the Act of Confederation. This is the more reprehensible
as Maritime requirements, in comparison to
major Canadian demands, are limited in scope
and monetary involvement.
The average
Maritime citizen asks very little of life; not
riches, nor power, nor acclaim, nor the
demand that the sweat should be wiped from
his brow. He is prepared to engage in honest
toil. All he asks are the ordinary things: a
home and plot of land that he may call his
own, his children in laughter and at play,
security from fear and want, freedom to practise the faith of his fathers, and comparable
advantages for his children in matters of
health and education. He asks just the simple

ordinary things which go to make up everyday life, but without which the burden of
life is unendurable.
That he does not receive the same consideration as citizens in other areas of Canada
has received demonstration on many occa:sions. It was so stated in the survey of
Canadian life by the Rowell-Sirois Commission, and made a matter of official record.
If any other evidence were wanting, it may be
found in the assistance accorded and subsidies
paid to the basic industries of Central and
Western Canada as compared to the assistance
accorded to the industries of the Maritime
Provinces.
In the latter provinces fishing is of paramount importance, comparable in some degree
at least to agriculture in other sections of
Canada. In the past it has been a neglected
industry, receiving scant acknowledgment by
successive governments.
Tacked on to
another department as an insignificant appendage, it was sorrowfully neglected. Finally
raised to the dignity of a special department,
it was manned by individuals whose knowledge of the fisheries was negligible. It was a
ministry that went begging. If any province
or sectional interest was to be recognized, it
was the trial-horse of cabinet appointment.
When a Minister of Fisheries displayed ability
he was transferred or elevated to a position
officially regarded as of greater importance.
Its purpose and functions were more punitive
than productive. A multiplicity of laws were
enacted giving to the minister of the day
arbitrary powers over matters concerning
which his training and environment were
incompetent to advise and instruct him. As
a result, until more recent appointees of high
calibre, our fisheries were on a low level of
government consideration. The result is the
discriminatory aspects so ably reported in
another place by representatives of Maritime
constituencies.
Mention was made of the assistance given
to agriculture as opposed to the inattention
accorded to the fisheries. The prompt action
in respect to the outbreak of foot and mouth
disease, a truly national calamity, is in
marked contrast to the action of the government of the day when sanctions against Italy
destroyed overnight the north-shore fisheries
of New Brunswick. The county of Gloucester suffered in particular. Boats rotted at
the wharves. The only means of livelihood
was destroyed. Consequent malnutrition had
its after-effects in an outbreak of tuberculosis
on the highest percentage basis in Canada.
The credit of the county was endangered.
While relief loans to Saskatchewan in millions were forgiven by the government, this

MARCH 26, 1952
county and the province of New Brunswick
had to pay on the barrel-head for every cent
of their portion of relief expenditure. This
left its impact on New Brunswick's economy
for the greater part of two decades. It is still
felt, and acutely felt, particularly in the
areas immediately affected. Its impact will
wear thin only with the passage of time and
continued belt-tightening in localities which
leave little play for such a reducing process.
Recently, in the province of Nova Scotia,
losses in the fishing industry have been
heavy; lobster traps alone to the value of
three-quarters of a million dollars have been
destroyed. Wharves have been damaged and
the plants erected upon them, with all their
equipment, have been carried out to the sea.
Boats have been broken up and at least ten
lives have been lost. This is the fisherman's
lot, a common lot of yearly occurrence, with
which I am fully familiar.
As I stated in a previous debate, I was
born where the ocean spray watered our
door-yard. I have seen the seas in their
intemperate moments. They may have their
glamour for poetic minds, but they have their
trials and hardships in the prosaic tasks of
fishing. Many of my friends and neighbours
have gone down to the sea in ships and have
not returned. They went on to give lasting
evidence that theirs was a hazardous calling,
one which has provoked little by way of
sympathetic attention. Those engaged in the
calling are apparently supposed to take
everything in their stride, while watching the
more favoured and more fortunate elements
of the social order receiving benefits which
in all conscience and in all justice they should
share on a basis of equality. The calamities
of the Maritimes have always been casually
passed along as acts of God, over which governments have no responsibility; while,
apparently, from the official point of view
Divinity does not operate in other sectors of
Canada.
Attention in another place has been focused
on these strained and unequal qualities of
mercy. The case was so well and effectively
covered as to require no elaboration. If the
payments reported and the subsidies accorded
were necessary to the promotion of industry
and the safeguarding of Canada's way of life,
I firmly support them. One or two were of
special interest: the $500,000 paid annually
for aluminum pails, to make the maple syrup
taste better, was a toothsome item which
might call for a special explanation; but in
the main and at the moment I am not sufficiently informed to either commend or condemn. Neither am I asking that payments
should be made in the Maritime Provinces for
every business loss or speculative venture,

but I do contend that loans should be provided for the immediate re-establishment of
victims of recent marine disasters; and that
for a long range view there should be
inaugurated some form of calamity insurance
on a co-operative basis, administered by an
independent board or commission under
governient auspices, which would bring
some measure of relief in relation to these
recurring problems in the fishing industry.
Another feature which I would stress would
be adequate facilities, not only in the port
of Saint John, but in the harbours from
which our fishermen operate and where they
must find a haven for their boats and equipment, and for the protection of life. A
definite research plan should also be initiated
and zealously pursued against the marine
borer, which for so long a period has been
the destructive factor in the building program
of individuals and governments. As far as
protective facilities are concerned, I can see
within my immediate vision in the locality
in which I live, many projects which require
prompt attention. These, I know, have been
placed in detail before the appropriate authorities by the member for Charlotte. If I were
called upon for special advice as to the ways
and means of providing the requisite funds
and effecting a lasting improvement in the
industry concerned, I would make the following recomnendations: Ease up a little in the
payment of subsidies-many people believe
this is a drama which is over-acted; divert
a small percentage of the sums to be expended
on the St. Lawrence Seaway; send the more
favoured recipients of government bounty to
Florida, if you must, but give our fishermen
the facilities to fish and sail, and they themselves will tame the seas and work out
their own salvation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Doone: But do not permit the
present sectional disparity to be a permanent
feature in Canadian life. How it bas continued to exist under successive governments
in the face of known facts and repeated representations staggers the imagination and is
beyond the range of human comprehension.
I join with Maritime members in protesting
its continuance. In this country we have
ties of common history, of political outlook
and geography; as provinces we should not
be divided into separate units. For the ultimate good there should be cohesion of purpose and economic interest to ensure our permanence as a nation.
May I say a word about Canada's most discussed and astounding surplus. It has long
been considered a maxim of government financing that one did not have to explain a
surplus. In the present case, apparently,

MARCH 26, 1952
thinking is wrong. Al our teaching is
opposed to such a social disorder. It is
time, therefore, for soul searching on a
national scale. We must make up our minds
whether the sacred word is to be relegated
to the dust of attic storage or retain the
prominent position it once held in Canada's
homes as a spiritual guide and mentor of
men. As members of a continuing society
we know that such formulae are in error.
As members of a Christian nation we know
that life is not an end in itself, to be lived
as long as possible and by the easiest possible means. Such a measure of life's purpose is 'a denial and negation of ail those
things which history bas taught us to regard
as the finest things in life-man's devotion
to duty, his patriotism, his constant fight
for justice and liberty, his personal struggles
for moral nobility. We know rather that as
mortals we move forward individually to
our common and inevitable end, that we can
justify our existence only by acceptance of
life's serious responsibilities. As Christians
we know that this can only be accomplished
by the spiritual outlook which may be implanted in the minds of our children.
This brings me in natural sequence to education. Catering as it does to the heirs of
all the ages, it is one of the most important
functions of society.
To our schools is
entrusted the training. of youth, and this
training must of necessity be the foundation
upon which the future of this .country will
rest. That society is becoming more conscious-minded of this duty. may be gauged
from the painstaking and effective manner in
which efforts in various provincial jurisdictions are being applied. Changes in the educational system undreamed of in years past
have been effected.
Living standards of
school rooms and educational standards alike
have received attention. The important part
which the teachers play in the moulding of
young lives and the influence which they
exert upon future events and happenings,
have to some degree been recognized. Still
sub-normal, their vocation has been placed
upon a higher plane, more in keeping with
their position in the social system. Aids to
vocational training are important stimuli to
extension in this phase. Cultural training
now forms an essential part of school life, and
its value in building a sound citizenry is
being weighed in a proper measure. Correspondence schools, adult education, visual and
auditory aids, are modern adjuncts of an educational program all of which play their
special role in the promotion of a better concept of society.
There are, however, further adjustments.
I will cite them briefly. Provision for a larger

elevation in respect of teachers is an essential item of such refinements. There is also
a growing conviction that the moral structure
needs correction through religious instruction
in the schools. In our country, with its powers
of compromise, surely some effective plan can
be worked out for this important feature. All
that is required for this purpose is a spirit of
fairness, of amity, and co-operation. On this
point it is useful to remind ourselves that no
country in this modern world can safely protest its aims of progress unless and until its
foundations on both secular and non-secular
lines are securely laid.
The third requisite is more funds, to pursue
the purposes already initiated along modern
and realistic lines. There is a definite gap in
this respect, particularly in municipal financing, which in large measure bears the costs
of the educational system. The surrender or
rental of traditional taxing fields by the provinces to the dominion left many municipalities
with a low taxation base from which to supply
the services demanded. This is a matter
which calls for earnest and careful consideration. The collective determination of all governments should direct the educational policy
of this country to the end and purpose that
no sub-marginal areas should endanger or
lower the average of educational benefits and
facilities. In justice to and having respect to
the factors mentioned, I am firmly in support
of dominion government aid on a per capita
pupil basis.
In drawing to a close, it is a pleasure to
say that on a dominion level we have much
for which we should be duly thankful. It has
been stated, and truthfully stated, that never
in all history has there been such an expansion of economic power and prosperity as
this country has recently -achieved. The gross
national product has reached prodigious
figures. In the past year it attained its highest
point in Canadian history: the enormous sum
of $21-5 billion, or $1,530 per capita. Notwithstanding high taxation and high commodity costs, living standards have been
maintained at their finest level. It is true
that the effort to pay and live is staggering
in its many phases, but as long as we as a
nation walk in diamond dust, we must expect
this unwelcome visitor as a constant and
irritable companion. Until society in all its
branches gets down to meaner causeways and
more solid foundations, we must also expect
the heavy hand of taxation. The eye that
can see growing personal and business costs
and advancing trends in municipal requirements, cannot be suddenly blind to increasing
demands on a government or national level.
In addition, as previously stated, the matter
of defence poses problems which must be met

SENATE
not only with national courage and resolution, but with the finances necessary for its
proper and effective prosecution.
It is well though, I believe, to strike a
sobering note in relation to our easy and
matter-of-course mode of living. Thinking
persons must realize that to some degree, at
least, inflationary prices and war commitments during the past years have given us an
artificial prosperity. It remains to be seen
whether our economy as presently founded
has the hard core of endurance. Present high
prices and quotations with regard to futures
must concern the minds of those who place
their money in manufactured goods without
any assurance of stability in the maintenance
of the selling structure. High priced inventories, the hidden or delayed depression and
diversions in our foreign trade are factors
which only the unwary may ignore. With
defence expenditures an undoubted stimulant
to internal trade-for the present at least
there should be no downward trend in
national spending-the delayed depression
may never appear. In the meantime good
workmanship, good values and production
should constitute immediate and effective
replies to high prices and the high cost of
living. For the future the dominant aim
should be the re-establishment on a free
enterprise basis of our foreign trade.
Even with these provisions we are not
at the end of the highway of trial. The
planning of a post-war world will bring
formidable issues-demobilization, repatriation and re-establishment of our armed forces,
occupational change-over, the absorption in
civil life of women engaged in war services,

nomadic tendencies of our modern industrial
economy, and other factors multitudinous in
number presented in civic, national and international relations. It is not a matter of easy
and simple endeavour. It will require clear
heads and careful thinking, strong minds,
stout hearts and willing hands. To its accomplishment, that we may warm our hearts
beside the fires of life, that there may be no
shadowed paths along which failures pass,
must be brought all the sturdy virtues, the
bravery and grim determination of our people.
In these respects may I offer my sincere
and earnest wishes that this country of ours
will respond as it has in the past to the
demands which time and events may make
upon it. May I express the further hope that
in whatever sphere of activity we are placed,
we will each and ail persevere; that Providence may accord to us in our capacity as
citizens, to those charged with the responsibility of conducting our Canadian affairs,
and to those on a higher level who are
entrusted with the weal and woe of nations,
the untamed spirit and unquenchable ardour
that in the Empire's darkest hour and in the
face of all but insurmountable odds caused
its leader to exclaim: "Whatever happens at
Dunkerque, we shall fight on."

PRIVATE BILL
THIRD READNG

Hon. Mr. Wood moved the third reading of
Bill O, an Act to incorporate the Boundary
Pipeline Corporation.

SECOND READING

Hon. H. R. Emmerson moved the second

reading of Bill G-3, an Act to amend the
Prisons and Reformatories Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
really a very simple one, and the explanatory notes cover the whole matter. The Interprovincial Home for Young Women at Coverdale, in Albert County, New Brunswick, set
up by Act of the legislature in April of 1921,
is an institution where young women between
the ages of sixteen and twenty-one may be
sent to serve sentences of not less than one
year or more than three years. This bill is
patterned after section 107 of the Prisons
and Reformatories Act, and its purpose is to
provide for those confined at the Interprovincial Home the same privilege that is now
held by women and girls confined to the
Good Shepherd Reformatory and the Good
Shepherd Industrial Refuge. That is, women
who have a clear history of six months of
good service in these institutions may receive
licences of leave.
I do not think anything further need be
said. If other information is wanted, the bill
could go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It seems to be a very
simple bill, and unless there is any desire
that it be sent to committee, I suggest that
it be read the third time now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before it is passed, may I
ask whether this is strictly a provincial home.

MARCH 27, 1952
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: It is an interprovincial
home, and receives inmates from the provinces of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And the provincial governments are responsible for this home?
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: The provincial governments are responsible.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I should like to ask the
sponsor a question. Apparently, when a
licence is issued after good conduct to such
female persons, it is a licence to be at large
in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, or in any part
thereof specified in the licence. If what may
be called a temporary discharge is granted,
what is the purpose of obliging the person
to remain within the three provinces
mentioned?
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: As I understand it, a
woman's sentence is not completed when she
leaves the institution on a ticket of leave,
and she must report periodically to a parole
officer. She may, for reasons of misbehaviour,
be returned to the institution to complete her
sentence. In fact, her sentence might be
extended under such circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a further question? The bill contains the phrase ".. .during
the term of six consecutive months by good

He said: Honourable senators, this bill does
not require any extended comment. I think its
objects are such that all honourable senators
will approve of it.
The Royal Canadian Academy of Arts is the
oldest official art institution in Canada. It was
founded by the Governor General, the Marquis of Lorne, and was incorporated on May
17, 1882. It is interesting to read the first part
of the original Act of incorporation. It is as
follows:
Whereas a society, consisting of professional
artists, has been founded in the Dominion of Canada

by His Excellency the Right Honourable the
Marquis of Lorne, Governor General of Canada,
and by Her Royal Highness the Princess Louise,
and with the sanction of Her Majesty Queen
Victoria, has been entitled the Royal Canadian
Academy of Arts;

-and

so on.

Naturally, the original incorporation was
not sufficient over all these years, and in
1913 another Act was passed re-incorporating
the society, extending its powers, stating its
objects on so on. Section 3 of the Act of
1913 reads:
The objects of the Academy are and shall be the
encouragement, improvement and cultivation of the
arts of painting, sculpture, architecture, etching,
engraving and of design as applied to the industrial
arts and manufacturers, and the promotion and
support of education in all such arts, and for the
purpose of attaining such objects, the Academy is
authorized-

I think it probably will remain here.
The next amendment enlarges the objects
of the academy. It does this by repealing
section 3 of the present Act and substituting
a new section 3, which contains some additional words. The present section 3 reads:
The objects of the Academy are and shall be

the arts of painting, sculpture, architecture-

And here come the first words that are
added:

Then the section goes on to read as at
present:
-and
the promotion and support of education in
all such arts, and for the purpose of attaining such
objects, the Academy is authorized(a) to hold exhibitions in the principal cities of
Canada and elsewhere;
(b) to establish schools of art and design;
(c) to continue to aid in the advancement of the
National Gallery-

Here are the added words:
-and to co-operate with the National Gallery in
activities in which the Academy has an interest.

That appears to be narrowing the
Academy's powers rather than widening them.
The number of academicians is limited in this
way. At present the Act limits the number to
forty, of whom not more than twenty-two may be
painters, not more than five sculptors, not more
than nine architects, and not more than four
designers, etchers and engravers. The bill makes
these changes:
The number of academicians shall not exceed
forty-five, of which twenty-four shall be reserved
for painters, six for sculptors, ten for architects,
and nve for designers.

In order for a member of the society to be
elected an academician it has been necessary
for him to have contributed to the National
Gallery a specimen of his work in his particular branch of art. Now the members are
largely painters, and it is not always practical
for a painter to give a specimen of his work
to the gallery, so there is an amendment providing that be may instead deposit evidence
of his work in his particular branch of art.
Voting in the society is of course a rather
important matter. At present the affairs of
the Academy are vested in a council composed of a president, a vice president and
twelve other academicians. The bill provides that the council shall be composed of a
president, a treasurer, eight academicians and
four associates.
Under the present Act the Academy may
establish honorary, retired, non-resident and
other classes of academicians.
The bill
empowers the Academy to establish similar
classes of associates as well.
The Academy's present membership of
forty academicians and seventy-five associates

includes many of the great names among
painters and other artists in the Dominion of
Canada. Last year Mr. L. A. C. Panton, a
well known professional artist of Toronto,
was president. The names of many of the
other distinguished members of the Academy
would, if mentioned, be well known to many
of us here, and they give to the Academy
great solidity and distinction.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Can the honourable
senator tell us how many academicians there
are at present? I see that the bill raises the
number to forty-five, of whom twenty-four
are to be painters. The present Act provides
that not more than twenty-two of the
academicians shall be painters, and I should
like to know if my honourable friend can say
whether there are that number in the
Academy.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, there must be
nearly that number, because there are forty
academicians. The limitation of membership
to which the honourable member has referred
applies to academicians, not to associates.
There is very little difference between them,
except that, as I have pointed out, an
academician can qualify only by contributing
a specimen of his art to the National Gallery
-or, if the bill passes, by depositing evidence
of his work. Generally speaking, the academicians and associates are all professional
artists, and all take part in the management
and activities of the society.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I wish to refer to just one section,
which relates to the deposit of pictures in the
National Gallery. I have no doubt that we
shall have an opportunity of making an
inquiry about this in committee. I think that
the National Gallery should be represented,
because after all the council should have the
final authority to pass upon pictures which
hang in the gallery. There seems to be a
point here that should be made clear.
I am perfectly in accord with this bill, and
especially with its new feature empowering
the academy to encourage, improve and
cultivate design in the graphic, decorative
and industrial arts. The son of one of the
worthiest members of this body is in charge
of this type of work at the gallery, and is
doing it very well. I think it has brought
the position of the National Gallery of Canada
up to date. On that ground, if on no other,
the bill is justified.
Hon. John C. Davis: Honourable senators,
by way of enlightenment, I think it may be
said that in the Royal Academy in England

He stayed with his people in England and
maintained his position along with them in

not of the staunchest and most rugged type,
he never faltered. We reverence the high and

taken his place with his fathers and entered
upon his immortal reward.
Also, last fall we had the visit of the then
Princess Elizabeth, now our Queen. The
memory of ber is still fresh in our hearts.
Up and down the corridors of this building,
and elsewhere, we saw Elizabeth and her
consort fraternize with her people. She was
then received and recognized by us all for
a beautiful and charming young woman; she
is now also our sovereign. As her mother
has said, she occupies at the present time, as
queen, a very lonely position. This afternoon,
as at the opening of the session, our hearts
went out with our prayers to this young figure
on the throne of our Commonwealth-the
Queen of Canada. Our thoughts go back to
the time in 1837 when another young woman,
seventeen years of age, mounted the throne
of England, Queen Victoria, whose reign was
one of peace, of glory and of consolation to
all the peoples subject to her kindly rule.
Elizabeth, ascending the throne of the Commonwealth with this tradition of a young
queen, will have our deepest prayers and our
sincere good wishes.
To the mover and seconder of the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne I wish
to extend my heartiest congratulations on
their very fine achievements. The mover (Hon.
Mr. Howden) is an old friend of mine. Nearly
thirty years ago I was one of a group of men
who called on Dr. Howden to ask him, upon
a redistribution of seats and the creation of
the federal riding of St. Boniface, Manitoba,
to iallow his name to go before a nomination committee. If my memory serves me
right, I was the one who placed him in
nomination at that time. I was his electoral
agent in that election and at many elections
since. I believe I must have spoken from at
least a hundred platforms in support of the
good doctor. He is one of that fast disappearing type of physician, the old family doctor,
that is being superseded through the advent
of modern mass medicine: the man whose
heart is quick to respond to the needs of his
patients; who long before the advent of good
roads and free use of automobiles did not
hesitate to rise in the middle of the night,
with no thought or hope.of pecuniary reward,
to travel along miles of country road to lonely
homes to bring aid to the suffering and relief

to those in pain. For that reason he was and
is still loved in the riding he so long represented in the other house.
Having said this, I must add that, in his
speech on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, my friend used one or two
sentences, appearing in almost the last paragraph of the report, with which I am in no
way in agreement. They are as follow:
There seems to be nothing we can do about itwell, not much at present, but try our best to
relieve the distress of starving Chinese, starving
Indians, starving Japanese, and perhaps starving
Russians. This will not help rnuch, for still they
corne; but by painless and harmIess means the
birth-rate could be controlled, and when countries
can furnish their own people with food there will
be fewer wars.

To these sentiments I cannot, for all my
years of association with him, in any measure
subscribe. They are a re-enunciation of the
ýcenturies-old theory embodied in Malthus's
Essay on Population, wherein the author,
applying the geometrics of progression of the
'compound interest table to population, forecast increasing distress to the world because,
as he believed, the population would grow
beyond the increase in the means of subsistence.
Therefore I have to distinguish
between the man whom I have supported all
these years, the man whose work and charity
have so greatly contributed to the alleviation
of suffering and physical ills, and the prin,ciple he has here enunciated, the Malthusian
theory that control of the birth-rate is a
means of preventing wars. Malthus is not a
modern, but his ideas have been taken up by
Bertrand Russell, Brock Chisholm, and others
of that ilk who have access at times to the air
waves
of
the
Canadian
Broadcasting
Corporation.
I think this theory that wars are fought
on account of over-population should be
brought to the test of history; that an examination of the causes of war does not in any
way support the conclusion which the
honourable senator propounded in his speech,
and without wishing to tire the house, I
should like to examine historically a few of
the series of great wars which have been
such a scourge to Europe and to this continent
in the last century or so.
The first of these is recorded in history
as the Napoleonic Wars. What was the reason
for -the Napoleonic Wars, which blasted
Europe for almost a quarter of a century?
An ideology was created.
Napoleon, a
brilliant man, making use of certain advantages, finally broke forth in uncontrollable
ambition on a world-wide scale. In the
middle of the eighteenth century France was
governed by a very inefficient autocratic
monarchy controlled by an effeminate king.
The social conditions in France were attacked

MARCH 27, 1952
in the writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau
and Voltaire. The fabric of government
finally tottered and broke under these attacks,
and the rabble moved in and the purge came.
The blade of the guillotine rose and fell
as the tumbrels carted their viotims to their
places of execution all over France. The
rabble government was having its financial
difficulties, but these were not due to overpopulation. The countries surrounding France
at that time were struck with fear-the same
fear that comes to all minds .at the present
time under almost similar circumstances.
Little wars broke out. A French governing
assembly was set up. A revolutionary named
Barres, recalling the achievements of a young
military officer appealed to him to use
violence in protecting the assembly. This
young man of twenty-four or twenty-five
years of age cleared up the rabble situation
in Paris, and as his reward he was appointed
commander of the French army in Italy.
From that time on the name of Napoleon
gained stature. A great series of campaigns
followed in Italy, and the acts of military
strategy displayed in these campaigns are
still read and studied by military people
throughout the world.
Uncontrollable ambition took possession of
this warrior. The coup d'etat of the Assembly
was furnished by Napoleon, and he created
himself first a consul and then emperor. He
directed his troops from Cairo on the Nile
to Moscow in Russia. His actions were not
motivated by reasons of over-population and
problems of feeding the people, but by sheer
personal ambition. Just compare those times
with the present: you will find the saine
ideology, and the brilliance and genius of
the ruthless mind overriding everything else.
What happened in Germany's history was
very similar. Germany originated in the old
Prussian state under Frederick the Great, a
student of military tactics and a great soldier.
Germany was temporarily set back by the
brilliant achievements of Napoleon. A half
century later the Machiavellian statesman,
Bismarck, contrived an atta-ck on Austria and
then on France. He co-ordinated and federated
all the individual German states, ultimately
forming an empire of these autonomous units.
Pursuing the pattern set by Frederick the
Great, Bismarck established the future trend
of Germany. Then came a new monarch,
Kaiser Wilhelm. His ambition ran contrary
to that of Bismarck, and his first -action was
to get rid of that great stateman. In those
days Punch magazine celebrated the event
with a cartoon drawn by Sir John Tenniel,
called "Dropping the Pilot." This cartoon
portrayed the German ship of state with
Kaiser Wilhelm leaning over the rail, and
watching Bismarck, the old statesman who

had welded the German empire, slowly
descending the ladder and vanishing from the
scene. Kaiser Wilhelm did not stop at this.
His professors devised the theory of geopolitics and of establishing Germany's place in
the sun. They did not do this because
Germany was starving.
The honourable gentleman from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden), referred to what
I shall call the "fracas" which occurred; in
South Africa; I shall not call it a war.
It was instigated by Kaiser Wilhelm's
promises to Oom Paul Kruger of the Transvaal. Finally there was a direct challenge
to England, and a German drive for world
domination. This was not because of any lack
of food or reasons of overpopulation; it was
simply a movement in the world's political
and economic system.
Again, after a trivial incident in Bulgaria,
now Yugoslavia, Wilhelm embarked on the
first world war for the purpose of .gaining
complete global domination. The war spread
throughout Europe and on the high seas. The
cataclysmic struggle that followed, which is
depicted in the pictures on these Senate walls,
was not caused: by any Malthusian theory of
over-population and under-nourishment.
Then came a new Germany, taking advantage of the weakness of the League of
Nations to raise itself once again under a
new figure of genius, and it was the ideology
of geopolitics and Mein Kampf that again
led to a challenge for world domination and
brought on the cataclysm that we have just
experienced.
Now we have a new threat from Russia,
based on the ideology of Marx, Engels, Lenin,
Trotsky and Stalin. In Russia the breaking
down of government was followed by the
coup d'état, the purge and the secret police.
Russia successfully emerged from the world
war after many treacherous acts, like the
slaughter of the elite of the Polish Army at
Kaytn, and the terrible treatment of the
Poles of Warsaw, when the Russians on
the suburbs of that city encouraged the Polish
underground to emerge and fight the enemy
and then deliberately halted and allowed the
Poles to be massacred by the Germans. None
of these things was the result of overpopulation and undernourishment. I cannot agree
that the Malthusian theory provides a basic
explanation of the cause of war.
At the beginning of our sitting this afternoon His Honour the Speaker read, among
other prayers, the one ordained by the Son
of God upon earth:
Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be
Thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven.

SENATE
I presume that when we listen to this
prayer we assent to it, for it is a Christian
prayer and we are citizens of a Christian
country. Therefore we should follow the will
of God, which certainly does not require the
imposition of national birth control as a
means of preventing war. The distinguished
senator from Charlotte (Hon. Mr. Doone)
pointed out yesterday the dangers of birth
control on an individual basis.
I feel that we as a Senate should not accept
the Malthusian theory, which history has
proved to be without truth or validity. Nor
should we accept any philosophy of despair.
Science is just on the threshold of solving
many problems. Honourable members will
recollect that in the last war there was a
shortage of rubber. Well, to meet that shortage synthetic rubber was developed.
In
Germany, synthetie oils and gasolines were
used. Today we are told that it is possible
to produce synthetic foods without difficulty
on an enormous scale. Science, which sometimes almost seems to be a great Frankenstein that has turned against us, may do
humanity a service by solving the problems,
if they are problems, of overpopulation and
undernourishment.
The prayer to which I have referred goes
on in these words:
Give us this day our daily bread.
That is a prayer for not only ourselves, but
for our neighbours and all people everywhere. The Divine Creator is the only being
that has the power to answer prayer and
to "give us this day our daily bread".
Scientific developments that astound us from
time to time are only discoveries of laws that
have always
existed. Electricity, light,
thermodynamics, and so on, were created by
the great Law Giver at the beginning of
time, and He has left these and other
marvelous things to be discovered, to be made
manifest to us, to serve a proper purpose on
earth, to be a means of answering our prayer
for daily bread.
Now I wish to touch upon another subject
in an entirely different field. Last session
we passed the famous Bill 12, the object of
which was the so-called equalization of
freight rates. Equalization of freight rates
means that people in what are known as the
"have" provinces pay the same freight rates
as people in the West and the Maritimes. Let
us see what result the freight rates put into
effect on January 15 this year has had on some
of the manufactured products of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Where is that?
Hon. Mr. Reid: This should be good.
Hon. Mr. Davis: It will be good.

Previous to January 15, 1952, the freight
rate on steel commodities, such as steel
reinforcing bars, was $2.39 from Hamilton to
Edmonton. It is now $1.64. The freight rate
on the same commodity from Hamilton to
Winnipeg, for fabrication in one of the
suburbs of that city, is now $1.64, and the
carload rate from Winnipeg to Edmonton is
$1.41. This is a total gross rate, with a stopover in Winnipeg, of $3.05 as opposed to a
through rate from Hamilton to Edmonton
of $1.64.
This is not equalization of rates, as I understand it. Equalization of freight rates does
not mean that they operate like postage rates,
under which a piece of mail is carried from
Sydney, Cape Breton, to Sidney, Vancouver
Island, for the same denomination of stamps
as will carry it between any two intervening
points. I protest this interpretation most
seriously. The application of equalization of
freight rates extends not only to steel bars,
but to pipe, plates, sheet metal, ýcanned goods,
and so forth. If equalization means anything,
it means the equalization of the rate per ton
per mile, and not a rate on the postage stamp
basis to which I have referred.
I would draw the attention of the honourable chairman of the Committee on Transport
and Communications to the grave injustice
which is being done to the city of Winnipeg
and its growing industries by way of this
so-called equalization of freight rates. To my
way of thinking, it is contrary to equalization;
indeed, it .could be deemed a device to disequalize freight rates and leave Winnipeg
industries to wither on the branch.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We tried to warn you.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of this debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Horner was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.

days a week, and before the Easter adjournment it will have completed some 150 cases.
Many of the bills have received third reading, been passed by this chamber and sent

one report has been printed. The consequence is that the other house has been

DIVORCE
PRINTING OF EVIDENCE

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
yesterday the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) inquired about the
printing of evidence in divorce matters, and
I promised to obtain some information for
him on the subject. I now have the information, which is to this effect: To date the
printed evidence in only five cases has been
received. The Printing Bureau has contracted
with private printers in various places in
Ontario and Quebec for the printing of the
evidence in more than 100 of the total of 141
cases that have been heard so far. It is the
intention of the Bureau to print as much
of the evidence as is possible. The Superintendent of Printing reports that the outside
printers to whom these 100 cases have been
referred, have agreed to have 90 per cent of
the evidence delivered by the middle of next
week.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the absence of the honourable chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), may I say that we are anxious to
get these reports printed so that they can
be placed in the hands of the members of
the House of Commons for their consideration
prior to our return after the Easter recess.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have been advised
that the Queen's Printer has done everything
he possibly can to expedite the work in the
hands of the outside printers. He has sent
each of them a telegram. Only five reports
have been received so far, three from
Montreal and two from Toronto, but 90 per
cent of the remainder are expected by the
middle of next week. This means that they
should be in the hands of the members of
the other place before they adjourn for the
Easter recess.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The other day in the House
of Commons a distinguished member objected
to a certain divorce bill being brought before
the Senate because the petitioner in the case,
a woman, is now living in Toronto. He
-wanted to know why the case was not heard
in Toronto.
In this particular case the
parties lived in Newfoundland following their
marriage. Subsequently the husband deserted
his wife and married a woman in the United
States, by whom he had children.
Our

divorce laws provide that a divorce petition
must be brought in the province in which the
husband is domiciled, and after two years of
desertion the action must be brought in the
Canadian province of the last known domicile
of the husband. In this case the last known
domicile of the husband in Canada was Newfoundland. Now, if the evidence in this case
had been available to the distinguished
gentleman in the other place, he would have
seen why the petition was brought before the
Senate Divorce Committee. Members in the
other house are raising objections because
of factors which may seerm rather strange,
but which actually are in accordance with
the Canadian law.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should like to inform
the house about our prospects for work for
the next two or three days. I have been
advised that two supply bills are to be introduced in the other place today, both which
will require to be dealt with and finalized by
parliament by next Monday, which is the
end of the fiscal year. The first is the interim
Supply Bill, to provide the usual one-sixth of
the estimated funds required for the current
year; the second covers the supplementary
estimates for the year just ended.
My information is that the Interim Supply Bill may reach us this afternoon, in
which case I would ask honourable senators
to deal with it today. On the other hand,
I am informed that the supplementary estimates may not be through the other house
until late this evening or perhaips Monday
afternoon.
In those circumstances I am
going to suggest that when the Senate adjourns this afternoon it stand adjourned
until Monday evening next at 8 o'clock,
when we shall deal with the supplementary
estimates and, if necesary, with the Interim
Supply Bill, assuming that we have not
dealt 'with it this afternoon. And it is expected that following the sitting of this house
on Monday evening there will be a Royal
Assent.

September, 1951, and that this house do approve
the same.

He said: Honourable senators, the treaty
between the Allied Nations and Japan was
circulated to honourable members of this

MARCH 28i 1952
house, I think, about a fortnight ago, but
in case they should wish to refer to it during this debate, I understand that copies
are 'available in the hands of the Clerk.
The treaty was signed in the city of San
Francisco on September 8, 1951, by the representatives of forty-eight different governments, 'but it is a condition of the treaty
that it must be ratified by all the states who
signed it at that time. Under article 23 of
the treaty it comes into effect for all those
who have ratified it when instruments of
ratification have been deposited on the one
hand, by Japan, and, on the other hand, by
a majority, including the United States, of
the eleven principal countries who were at
war with Japan during the war recently concluded-those
nations
being
Australia,
Canada, Ceylon, France, Indonesia, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Republic of the Philippines, the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the United States of
America.
Well, Japan has ratified that treaty, and
when the majority of those eleven countries
shall have done so, it comes into force. Of
the eleven nations, the United Kingdom
alone has already ratified it, and parliamentary approval and all the necessary steps
leading to formal ratification have been completed by Australia, New Zealand, the
United States of America and Ceylon. That
makes a total of five nations out of eleven,
so that if Canada takes the necessary parliamentary action and becomes the sixth nation to ratify the treaty, it will then come
into effect.
As I said, the treaty was signed on September 8 last, at San Francisco, but for over a
year previous to that it had been under active
negotiation at the diplomatic level between
the countries concerned. As might be expected
it was the United States which took the leading part in those negotiations, that country
being, as everybody knows, the principal
occupying power in Japan. The man who had
the principal part in negotiating this treaty
on behalf of the United States was Mr. John
Foster Dulles. As honourable senators are
aware, Mr. Dulles was for two or three years,
until quite recently-last week, in fact-one
of the principal assistants of Mr. Dean
Acheson, Secretary of State of the United
States.
Honourable senators will appreciate that
it was- not easy to arrive at an agreed: treaty
with Japan, particularly on behalf of some
of the nations which had suffered very
severely at her hands during the war. There
were rather basic resentments on the part
55708--9

of countries like Australia and New Zealand
at the treatment which had been accorded
some of their fighting men during hostilities.
There was resentment also on behalf of the
Philippines which had been very badly devastated by Japan. Great Britain had a good
many things to consider. She had to forget
about the tragedy of Singapore; and in particular she had to consider the trade rivalry
which had existed between herself and Japan,
previous to the war, and the rather unscrupulous methods of trade which had been a
feature of Japanese activities at that time. It
was therefore not easy to get all forty-eight
countries to agree on the terms of the treaty
of peace with Japan; in fact, I think it is
true to say that the countries of the far
Eastern Pacific would not have a-greed to it
unless they had been afforded further protection in the form of two additional covenants,
which were at the same time entered into
by the United States. The first was the
Tripartite Security Treaty between the United
States, Australia and New Zealand, and the
second was the Mutual Security Pact between
the United States and Japan.
But whatever may have been the objections
or the difficulties about reaching finality in
this treaty, they were finally overcome. The
principal consideration, I think, was that it
was most essentiall for the security of the
Far East, and indeed of the world in general;
that an attenpt should be made to bring
Japan back into the community of civilized
nations; and further, that she should become
a- bulwark against communist aggression in
the Far East.
While I am on that subject, I should draw
the attention of the house to the f act that
neither Soviet Russia nor Communist China
are parties to this treaty; but I think perhaps we can say that the treaty is all the
better for it. I do not want honourable senators to misunderstand me, for it was not for
want of trying that Russia is not a party to
this treaty. For four years, from 1947
onwards, the western powers did their best
to negotiate a Japanese treaty with the
Soviets, but as one has come to expect in
negotiations with Soviet Russia, the negotiations finally bogged down in complete futility,
in a vast strean of evasion, slander and lies
on the part of the Soviet representatives.
If honourable senators will bear in mind
what has happened-or rather, perhaps, what
has not happened-in connection with the
attempt to make a peace treaty with Austria
over the past six years, they will realize that
there was really very little hope of getting
the consent of the Soviets to any proper
peace treaty with Japan, and that the only
reason why we in the western world have

SENATE
been able to bring about this treaty has
been the fortunate circumstances that Soviet
Russia was not one of the occupying powers
of Japan when the war came to a close.
Now, dealing for a few moments with the
treaty itself. It is a generous treaty, and
its purpose is to restore Japan as an equal
member of the family of nations. I suppose
we can say that it represents a calculated
risk on the part of the allied governments
who had been at war with Japan, and who in
this treaty have forsaken revenge and
sought reconciliation. The experience which
the world has had with punitive, restrictive
treaties, has proved that such treaties bear
within themselves the seeds of their own
destruction. This treaty does not attempt to
gloss over Japan's aggressive acts; neither
does it seek to prolong Japan's exile from the
company of sovereign nations, there to brood
in sullen discontent to the detriment of the
important area of the world in which she
must live. It looks to the future co-operation
of a peacefully inclined Japan with other free
nations, in contributing to the stability of
Asia.
The treaty, as I say, is a very generous
one, and if honourable senators would like to
get at the spirit in which it was written they
cannot do better, I think, than read the two
short paragraphs of its preamble, which I
will now take the liberty of quoting. They
read thus:
Whereas the Allied Powers and Japan are resolved
that henceforth their relations shall be those of
nations which, as sovereign equals, co-operate in
friendly association to promote their common welfare and to maintain international peace and
security, and are therefore desirous of concluding
Treaty of Peace which will settle questions still
outstanding as a result of the existence of a state
of war between them;
Whereas Japan for its part declares its intention
to apply for membership in the United Nations and
in all circumstances to conform to the principles
of the Charter of the United Nations; to strive to
realize the objectives of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights; to seek to create within Japan
conditions of stability and well-being as defined in
Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United
Nations and already initiated by post-surrender
Japanese legslation; and in public and private
trade and commerce to conform to internationaliy
accepted fair practices;

Then follows the treaty.
The preamble, as I have read it, records
Japan's intention to seek membership in the
United Nations; to conform to the principles
of the Charter of the United Nations; to
continue the progress made in the occupation
period with respect to human rights and freedoms in Japan itself; and, finally, to conform
in public and private trade and commerce to
internationally accepted fair practices.

I believe that if Japan acts sincerely in the
spirit of these declarations she will have gone
a long way towards restoring the good will of
the allied powers.
Chapter II of the treaty deals with the disposition of former Japanese territory. Under
its articles, Japan formally ratifies the territorial provisions' of the Potsdam surrender terms, which provided that Japanese
sovereignties should be limited to the four
Japan therefore
main islands of Japan.
renounces in these articles all claim and title
to Korea, Formosa, the Pescadores, the Kurile
Islands, South Sakhalin, and to those islands
which she held in the South Pacific by reason
of a League of Nations mandate. Japan retains
residual sovereignty over the Ryukyu and
Bonin islands, although Article 3 makes it
possible for these islands to be brought under
the United Nations trusteeship system, with
the United States as the administering
authority.
One of the most important problems which
arose in negotiation of the treaty was that
of the security of Japan, and it is dealt with
in Chapter III of the treaty. By article
5 of this chapter, Japan accepts the obligations to settle her international disputes by
peaceful means, to refrain in her international
relations from the threat or use of force,
and to give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with
the Charter. The Allied Powers recognize
that Japan as a sovereign nation possesses
the inherent right of individual or collective
In other words, that means
self-defence.
that Japan becomes free again to have armed
forces. Article 6 provides that all allied
occupation forces shall be withdrawn from
Japan as soon as possible after the coming
into force of the treaty. However this article
states explicitly that there is nothing to prevent the stationing or retention of foreign
armed forces in Japan under the terms of any
agreement reached between one or more of
the Allied Powers and Japan.
In that connection I think I should point
out that a security treaty between the United
States and Japan was signed on the same
day the peace treaty was signed. Under its
terms United States land, air and sea forces
are to be stationed in and about Japan, to>
contribute to the maintenance of peace and
security in the Far East and to the security
of Japan against an armed attack. Japan's
military machine was completely dismantled
during the occupation, and to have restored
sovereignty to Japan without allowing her
the means to protect that sovereignty would
have been an empty gesture. I believe that

MARCH 28, 1952
Japan will see the wisdom of voluntary association in collective security arrangements
for ber defence, and will herself contribute
to those defences and thereby to the greater
stability of the Pacific area. We must all
hope that the Japanese are now aware of
the folly of aggressive militarism, and that
they are not likely to be misled again by
such chauvinistic slogans as those which
were the stock in trade of ber leaders prior
to the last war.
Chapter IV of the treaty is concerned
mainly with the future of Japan's commercial
relations. The treaty does not attempt to
settle questions of commercial policy, but
leaves this for bilateral settlement between
individual signatories of the treaty and
Japan, within the broad framework of the
peace treaty's provisions. Canada has a special
interest in the commercial provisions of the
treaty, and it is the Canadian government's
hope that Japan will not revert to trading
practices which aroused much criticism before
the war. On the other hand, I think we will
all have to realize that Japan, in order to
be able to exist as a commercial nation in
the future, will have to develop a very large
external trade with the rest of the world.
Article 9 in Chapter IV is of special importance to Canada, and already action has been
taken to implement its terms. Japan undertakes under this article to enter into negotiations with interested Allied Powers for the
conclusion of fisheries agreements respecting
the regulation or limitation of fishing and the
conservation and development of fisheries on
the high seas. -In Tokyo, in December of last
year, representatives of Canada, the United
States and Japan reached agreement on a
draft convention for the high seas fisheries of
the North Pacific Ocean. Our Minister of
Fisheries has described these negotiations as
most successful, and honourable senators will
recall the very interesting remarks made on
this subject last week by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid). Japan will not be in a position to sign
this important convention until the peace
treaty comes into effect: Canada, therefore,
has an additional reason for taking as early
action as possible on the ratification of the
peace treaty.
Generally speaking, the commercial clauses
of the treaty, although somewhat technical in
nature, may be summarized in a few words.
Japan's economy is not restricted in any manner, nor are any limitations placed on her
right to trade with all countries of the world.
The difficult problems raised after any war
with respect to claims and property rights are
dealt with in Chapter V, which is one of the
55708-9j

longest chapters in the treaty. Article 14 in
this chapter sets out one of the most important
principles of the treaty. It states clearly and
unambiguously that Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage
and sufTering she caused during the war.
However the Allied Powers also recognize
that if Japan is to maintain a viable economy,
and is not to become a further economic
trouble spot in an already troubled area, her
resources are simply not adequate to pay even
the just demands of her former victims. These
very limited reparations clauses could not but
be unsatisfactory to a number of states which
had suffered by reason of Japan's military
activities-for instance, the Phillipines and
Indonesia; but these nations finally accepted
these clauses in order that the larger objectives of the peace treaty might not be
endangered. Surely they were wise in this.
Surely the experience of Europe after the
first Great War has shown how futile it is to
try to collect excessive reparations from a
beaten enemy-yes, and not only how such
attempts fail, but how they poison international relationships for the years afterwards.
The drafters of this treaty have not made
this mistake. They have attempted to substitute reason for revenge. Japan undertakes,
under the terms of Article 14, to compensate
those Allied Powers whose territories she had
occupied, by making available the services
of the Japanese people in production, salvaging and other work. Further, she expresses
the desire, in Article 16, to make available
certain of her assets to indemnify members
of the Allied Forces who suffered undue hardships while prisoners of war of Japan. She
undertakes also to return all allied property
which she held during the war. To sum up,
I think it can be said that these reparation
clauses are generous and sensible, and above
all, that they will work.
This brief survey of the treaty is meant
only to highlight its more important provisions. I have not attempted to describe in
detail the long and difficult negotiations which
went into each and every one of the articles
that it contains. The treaty was negotiated
in a rather novel and unusual way, by discussions, which occupied more than a full
year. As I said at the beginning, attempts
were made as early as 1947 to get on with the
drafting of the treaty, but these attempts
were unsuccessful because of the insistence
of the Soviet Union that the treaty should be
drafted by the 'Council of Foreign Ministers,
a body in which the Soviet Union would have
a veto. The United States and other interested governments refused to accept this procedure, and after four years of constant effort
to urge agreement with the Soviet Union it

SENATE
was finally decided to foresake the traditional
conference method and to try to negotiate an
agreed treaty. As I have said, it was principally Mr. John Foster Dulles of the United
States who, in a year of negotiating with all
the other nations involved, brought about
agreement between them. The conference at
San Francisco was therefore not a conference
to negotiate a treaty, but a conference to give
formal approval to a text upon which agreement had already been reached through
diplomatic negotiations.
I should point out that the government of
this country, was given ample opportunity
during those negotiations to express its opinion on the various features of the treaty, and
it is confident that the treaty which is before
us today represents the maximum agreement
possible among the interested allied governments. It believes further that the treaty will
be successful in setting the pattern of Japan's
gradual return to the family of free and
sovereign nations.
Now, honourable senators, there is only one
thing further that I should say. It has been
suggested that this treaty might well be
referred for consideration to our Standing
Committee on External Relations, and I understand that, if a reference is made to the committee the minister is desirous and willing
to appear and to answer any questions with
regard to the treaty that members may see
fit to put to him. I also understand that my
honourable friend the senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) intends to move, in
amendment to the resolution as it stands upon
the order paper, that the subject-matter of
the resolution be referred to this standing
committee. If be does so I certainly shall
have no objection.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to deal with the treaty in
detail. I want first to congratulate the bonourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) upon his very clear and fair statement of the terms of the treaty.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wish also to make another
preliminary observation. This is really a
question of foreign relations. As this house
knows, I am not given to quoting statements
made by anyone else in any other place, but
I do wish to quote with approval the statement made yesterday in another place by the
leader of the party of which I have the bonour to be leader in this house, that parliament
ought to try as far as possible to reach
unanimous opinion on external affairs, and
that any difference of opinion about them
should be supported by very strong facts. I
also endorse his statement that whenever

some new principle or new policy in relation to foreign affairs is being adopted, parliament ought to be informed of it first,
either in private or in open sitting. I wholeheartedly agree with those two views. I
believe that our Parliament of Canada ought
to speak with one voice in all foreign affairs,
for we are a small country-though we cover
a lot of territory we are a small country in
world affairs-and we are in a unique position, with the United States on the one
hand and the Commonwealth of Nations on
the other. That position also imposes upon
us a great responsibility, and I am always
delighted when there is unanimity of opinion
in the other house with the principles of any
external policy under consideration. I hope
that there will be a similar unanimity of
opinion in this house at all times.
As to the resolution before us, I have no
criticism at all to offer but I do wish to
make a comment or two. I was always led
to believe that wars were caused by a
shortage of food or of land for occupation,
or some such thing as that. Well, there is
certainly a food shortage in many parts of
the world today. I hear statements made on
the public platform and I read newspaper
editorials advocating the giving by this country of large sums for the purchase of food
for Asiatic and various European countries in
order to prevent the outbreak of another war.
Well, though my memory does not go back
very far, it does take me back to the South
African war. That was only a small affair,
it is true, within the commonwealth or
empire as it was called then, but I do not
think that food had anything to do with the
cause of it. I think that war was brought
about by one man's ambition for power.
Whether he succeeded or not has nothing to
do with the point. Then, of course, I remember
well World War I. Why did that war break
out? True, the shooting of an Austrian archduke was what appeared to cause the war to
begin, but the real cause was the determination of the German Emperor to become one
of the rulers of the world. He trained and
inspired his people to support him in that
determination, and his love of power was
really the main cause of that war.
And certainly if ever there was a war that
resulted from a love of ipower or domination
and the crushing of freedom, it was World
War II. One man-true, he was a demagogue
-inspired a whole nation to support his dictatorial policy, and war became inevitable. It
is equally true that love of power and of
domination inspired the Japanese to fight.
And the threat of a third world struggle facing
us now arises from the desire of a few men in
one country to dominate the whole world.

MARCH 28, 1952
When World War 1 was in progress people
used to say that it was a war to end wars,
that there would neyer be another armed
conflict on such a large scale. Yet within
a few years a still more terrible war 'broke
out, and a lot of men who had fought in the
first one found theinselves fighting once more.
It is only reasonable that our people should
fear another outbreak, for in the last two
years we have made more preparations for
defence than ever before ti this country.
Then look at the war in Korea. Was that
caused by a shortage of food? No. Peace was
broken because North Korea wanted to control South Korea. 0f course, the people in
the north were urged on by the communistic
theorists from China and from Russia.
Now the great problem. is how to get the
world at large to understand that a country
that goes to war because of a love of power
cannot succeed. We are doing our best to
make this clear to any would-be aggressor.
That is why we are arming ourselves to the
utmost of our ability. In building preparations for defence the government may have
made blunders, it may have done the wrong
thing here and there, but I ar n ot; expressing
any criticism of it for that. If I had been in
office I might have done worse. We are
spending tremendous sums of money on this
preparation, transferring men from industrial
life to the armed forces, building ships, guns
and aeroplanes. All this is being done for
no other purpose than to prevent some nation
from carrying out its desire for aggrandizement. Now, the thing I arn wondering about
is how in our day and generation we are
going to get the world to understand that
desire for aggrandizement through conquest
must fail.
As to Japan-I do not know of any nation
that committed greater atrocities than Japan
did in the last war.
Hon. Mr. Wood: Germany.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. Boys from my city of
Winnipeg were taken prisoners of war by
the Japs, and somne were prisoners in Germany, and they say that those in the Japanese
camps were treated ten times as badly as
the ones in German camps. I know this
personally. When I heard that my boy was
going to Europe I said, "Well, that is bis
duty." But when I heard that he had volunteered to fight in Japan, I was sick. The
boys who have returned home to Winnipeg
from Japanese camps are unanimous ti
denouncing the atrocities of their captors.
Yet, world conditions are such that we have
to make a treaty with Japan. I am not
opposing it at all. The view expressed by
the deputy leader of the governent (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) is the same as my own. I am

with him wholeheartedly; and although I am
flot opposed to the bill being referred to committee, as far as I arn concerned it is not
necessary.
It is indeed a strange world in which we
find ourselves today. We are now trying
to make peace with Germany, and although
we may charge rnany things to that country, we are unable to make peace with her
because Russia stands in our way. We
.probably could make peace with part of
Germany, 'but it is not practicable to divide
that country, with some 20 million -people in
one portion and 40 million in another.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And Austria is in somewhat the same position.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I neyer thought that within about ten years after the entry of Japan
into the recent war I would be standing up
in parliament and voting to receive her
back with open arms; yet I arn doing that
very thing, and doing it wholeheartedly.
I have a further thought, and it may
seem strange coming from me. I do flot
believe that our policy in a world of mate-,
rialism, power and aggrandizement is going
to solve the world problem. I arn in agreement with what the United States and Great
Britain are trying to do, but I believe that
we have to do something more than give
food to people. We must give them thoughts
and ideas which will change their way of
looking on if e.
At times I arn astounded at the selfishness
of some of our Canadian people-my criticism is not directed particularly at men of
wealth or those who control industry-and
I wonder whether they are dealing with
people in the same way they would have
those people deal with them. We 'have
watched the actions of the communists in
their attacks on religion and religious leaders in certain countries. Why did they
seize the Roman Catholic archbishops and
other religious men in Austria and Poland?
Why do they poun-ce 'upon the missionaries
in China and in other parts o! the world?
The reason is always the same-their defiance of religion. If 'we do not teach people
the proper ideals of 11f e, we will go from
one w-ar to another.
The peace treaty now before us 15 the
best illustration of the kind o! history we
should be making. Here is a nation which,
in less than seven years from the conclusion
of the war, has ibecome a party to a generous 'peace treaty. I will say this for General MacArthur, that while he may go
down in history as a man who was flred
fromn his job, he will certain-ly 'be known as

SENATE
one Anglo-Saxon who made a great contribution towards the rehabilitation of the
Japanese nation and in bringing it to the
point where it is able to take its place
beside nations such as Great Britain and
the United States. I believe he has done
a great service to mankind.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We in Canada must deal
with other nations in the same way that we
would expect them to deal with us.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The Golden Rule.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not trying to preach
a sermon, honourable senators, but I think
that we are standing at the cross-roads of
history, and that a hundred years from now
this Japanese treaty will be held up as a
symbol of what the free world did in 1952.
I give great credit to John Foster Dulles and
the people of the United States, whose
patience and tolerance have brought about
this agreement. I also congratulate the British
Commonwealth of Nations, because as the
acting leader opposite has said, this treaty
could not have been brought about without
the co-operation of Great Britain, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and Ceylon. These
are the countries which made this agreement
possible. I hope that what is now taking
place will prove to the world the utter folly
of war. Notwithstanding the fact that Japan
did everything to make men mad, the conduct of the allied countries has been an
exemplification of the teaching of the great
Master, that we should turn the other cheek.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, the debate
was adjourned.

I would qualify the statement made by the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
about the unanimity with which foreign
policy affecting Canada is adopted. I think
that when conclusions are reached they
should be supported unanimously, but in the
reaching of them we should invite thorough
discussion and the expression of all shades of
opinion. In this country we certainly need
all the light that can be thrown upon our
relations with other countries. For that
reason, with a view to elucidating and crystallizing Canada's position in such matters
as the treaty now before us and the one
recently under discussion in the other house,
I would encourage rather than discourage,
more frequent debate and argument upon the
course to be taken.
It is a commonplace to speak of mankind as now standing at the cross-roads of
history. My view in connection with this
Japanese treaty is that the cross-roads of
history were reached thirty years ago, in
1922, when Great Britain, in conjunction
with the United States, decided to change
the orientation of policy from an AngloJapanese to an Anglo-American alliance.
Today we see one of the logical consequences and conclusions of that arrangement. We stand on the threshold of some
great reallignment of forces, and it remains
to be seen whether Japan is to be permanently included as a party to that great alliance of thirty years ago.

Without sipeaking any further on this
subject, I would suggest very strongly that
my motion be carried.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert was
agreed to.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Howden for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, in
rising to take part in this debate on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, I wish first to sincerely congratulate
the mover and the seconder of the Address.
I would also congratulate all those who took
part in the debate. I only regret that more
honourable senators have not seen fit to do
so. There were some excellent speeches: I
may instance those of the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), the
honourable senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte), and the honourable member for
Mount Stewart (Hon. Mr. McIntyre): in my
opinion all the speeches were of a high order.
For that reason, and because of my limited
ability, I have hesitated to take part. There
are, however, certain things which are mentioned in the Speech upon which I wish to
comment.
Before doing so I wish to offer some defence
of the honourable senator from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Howden), the mover of the Address,
who has been criticized-as he said he
expected to be-for his reference to birth
control. Although I am not equipped to
speak on some aspects of this question, I feel
that from other points of view I am fully
justified in making a few observations
about it.
On the general question, I do not know of
anyone who is better qualified by his
experience and reputation to speak than is
the honourable senator from St. Boniface.
Some reference was made by the honourable
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Davis) to the practical humanitarian work he

has done, without thought of reward, throughout his professional life. No doubt be has
been in homes where, perhaps, a lesser number of children would have had a better
opportunity of growing to full manhood and
womanhood. After all, there is a sound basis
for thinking of this kind, and I believe, notwithstanding the remarks of the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Davis), that
question of food supplies and other essentials
of life have caused wars in the past and are
likely to cause them in the future.
I agree with the well-chosen words
delivered this afternoon by the deputy leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), about
the generous and sensible reparation clauses
embodied in the Peace Treaty with Japan.
Nothing is to be gained by attempting to make
a defeated nation pay excessive reparations.
Some historians of repute have maintained
that one of the reasons Germany was so
anxious to annex territories was that she
did not like to see so many of her nationals
emigrating to the United States and other
parts of the world. In other words, Germany
felt that she was crowded for living space.
What about Japan and this treaty today?
We speak of the mistreatment that our good
missionaries are suffering in the Orient, but
if we are to practise practical religion we
should first look to see how we have treated
the nationals of the Oriental countries who
have come here to make Canada their home.
Just how freely have we opened our doors to
them? Honourable senators can easily recall
the many political debates that have taken
place on the question of allowing Chinese
women to join their husbands in Canada. If
I were entering China as a missionary I
should like to be able to say that I always
strongly argued in favour of Chinese immigrants being allowed to have their wives and
families join them here. I have said in this
house before that we should consider how
this country treated innocent Japanese Canadians on the West Coast at the outbreak of
the last war. The Japanese homeland, small
in size, is a heavily populated country. I
wonder how .the people of Canada, which is
fast becoming an industrialized country, are
going to regard this treaty. The Japanese
are an industrious people who are willing to
work long hours. Are we going to be ready
to accept their goods. These are matters
which we must consider in regard to the
signing of this treaty.
Then there is the question of India. I
remember last fall hearing an address in
Britain by Gilbert McAllister, Labour member of parliament, in which he said the average life span of a native of India is twentyfour years. I have read several books about
that country which have stressed the rapid

MARCH 28, 1952
growth of India's population, and there are
those of high standing who today are advocating some measure of birth control for that
country. According to recent press reports,
millions are facing starvation in droughtstricken areas of India. Vegetation is drying
up and the earth is scorched. I think we
might at least retain some of the friendship
these people have for us if we were to send
them food.
I disagree with the remarks made by my
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) about the St.
Lawrence Seaway. As one who comes from
the great agricultural province of Saskatchewan, I am unalterably opposed to paying
any special toll on our produce in order to
help develop hydro power on the St.
Lawrence river.
Hon. Mr. Ross: They are not imposing tolls
for the purposes of the power development.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, but the fees charged
will be used for the purpose of building this
power project. Our exports to the east will
be funnelled through the St. Lawrence Seaway, and as a result we will have to pay this
toll charge.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable gentleman realizes that western grain producers
have to pay freight rates.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And we shall have to
continue paying them-and increased rates
at that. At the present time the freight
rate structure in Canada is just about putting us out of the market. For many years
now I have been personally acquainted with
the business of shipping horses. I do not
believe there is any place in the world
where you can raise better horses less
expensively than you can in western Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Granted.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Some people think it
is cruel to allow horses to run free in the
snow all winter, but they are wrong. At
the present time there is a heavy demand
in eastern Canada for western horses, and
we find that the freight rate has increased
fram $350 to $700.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Per carload?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, per carload of
eighteen horses. This rate is practically
prohibitive. It seems to me that the Senate
should set up a special committee to inquire
into this whole question of transportation.
I read recently that the President of the
C.N.R. said that his company was considering going into the trucking business. I
would say that he is just about twenty years
too late, and that the different trucking
organizations would come forward and laim
55708-10

that the railway was being given a monopoly. Nothing will replace the railroads
for us; but our freight rates have certainly
gone up. If the ýSt. Lawrence Seaway takes
trade away from the railroads, then the railroads will be seeking still higher freight
rates. I believe that thè port of Churchill
could be made greater use of. It should be
the port of entry for many of our imports,
and in return we could ship at least 40
million bushels of grain through Churchill
each year.
Already there have been extensive hydroelectric developments in the East, and the
construction of the power project on the St.
Lawrence river will result in a further concentration of industry in Central Canada.
We in the West will benefit very little from
this.
Now I want to say something about the
subject of redistribution, which is a very
sore point with us in Saskatchewan. Through
redistribution Saskatchewan is likely to lose
a quarter of its present number of members
in the House of Commons. All political
parties in the province are in favour of the
proposal for a measure to provide that the
representation of any community or district
should not at any time be reduced by more
than 10 per cent.
I mention this matter ta call attention to
the seriousness of the situation for our province. If our political voice is so weak now
that we can be brushed aside with impunity,
the reduction of our present number of elected
representatives in parliament to the degree
suggested would cause that voice to become
even weaker. Some years after entering confederation Prince Edward Island was able ta
make a bargain whereby its representation
in the Commons was prevented from being
reduced to a level proportionate ta the province's decreased population. We in the West,
however, had no opportunity ta protect ourselves in this way, and the fact is that,
despite their great wealth and large production the western provinces have a very small
voice in parliament. British Columbia may
soon be demanding more members in this
chamber, and it has been suggested that the
appointment of more senators from the other
western provinces would relieve their
situation.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Will my honourable
friend permit me ta interrupt him for the
purpose of making one remark-a personal
remark? I do not think the province of
Saskatchewan will ever be inadequately
represented in this chamber so long as he is
a member of it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not so sure of that,
but I thank you very much.

SENATE
A good deal has been said from time to
time about subsidies and other payments to
Saskatchewan. Well, it cannot be pointed
out too often that Saskatchewan subsidized
the whole of Canada to the tune of perhaps
$200 million because of the bargain price at
which our wheat was sold in this country
during the war.
Consumers throughout
Canada were benefited at the expense of grain
producers in Saskatchewan and the other
prairie provinces. Reference has been made
to the $65 million allowance to producers, but
that was merely a small part of what we
should have got to compensate us for the
difference between the price paid to us and
the world price for the so-called class 2
wheat.
Some people point to the assistance given
to our farmers in drought areas. But let me
remind honourable senators of the fund that
is created from the toll of 1 per cent on every
bushel of grain we sell. It was intended that
the fund should become strong enough to
take care of all the demands for assistance by
farmers in dry areas, and if nothing unforseen happens and we are able to harvest the
main part of the crop this year, the contributions paid into this fund by the producers
themselves may be sufficiently large to meet
all demands and perhaps leave a reserve for
future years.
At present our cattle are prevented from
being shipped to the United States by an
embargo imposed by the authorities in that
country. But honourable senators will recall
that not so long ago it was the Canadian
government itself which prohibited exportation of cattle over the border. What was the
purpose of that embargo but to make meat
cheaper for the people of Canada? Producers
in Saskatchewan and Alberta were the chief
sufferers when cattle on Canadian markets
sold at ten and eleven cents a pound, live
weight, in contrast to the prices of thirty and
thirty-two cents a pound just across the line.
There again the whole of Canada benefited
at our expense. I say that if the cattle-producing West had been represented in parliament by eighty members, that sort of thing
would never have happened, for then the
government of the day would have known it
was politically unwise to permit it to happen.
This is just another instance of our suffering
just because of our lack of political strength.
It is said that while the present American
embargo remains in effect the price of our
cattle must drop. But for the life of me I
cannot understand why the slaughtering and
burying of a thousand head of cattle should
have that effect. I have great hopes that
eventually the Americans will open their
market to us again, though I realize they will
wait until it pleases them to do so.

Hon. Mr. Barbour: The packers are responsible for reducing the price.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Of course, the packers
will be anxious to sell all the meat they had
on hand. I am afraid that the floor price is
going to be a packers' floor price. We have
had too much of that in the past.
I am sorry that the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is not present
this afternoon, for I should like to tell him
that I am not at all satisfied with his reply
to the complaint made by my leader (Hon.
Mr. Haig) about the effect of the present taxation. The reply made by the leader of the
government was to the effect that the people
apparentily

approved of the taxation, since

they voted for the government. That was
his main argument. Well, I would remind
him of the results in elections that have
been held recently.

I protest against partici-

pation by honourable senators in election
campaigns, but I hope that the member of
this chamber who was organizer in the last
Ontario

election

continues

in

that

office.

Where in Canada have the people recently
shown that they are satisfied with the
present taxes? I fail to see any evidence of
this. I have here an article that originally
appeared in the Edmonton Journal and was
published in the Ottawa Journal. It reads:
Quite a surprise resulted from a recent investigation by the U.S. census bureau to determine
which is the richest city in the United States-in
terms, that is, of the average per capita income
of its inhabitants.
Most people would probably guess that New York
or booming Los Angeles would head the list, but
actually neither of the two is even in the top ten.
The winner is Washington, D.C. The income of the
average family in the U.S. capital is $3,925, while
38 per cent of the families have incomes exceeding
$4,750.
Since Washington is a strictly official city, with
almost no industries, this is one more proof that
government is becoming the biggest and most
flourishing business in the modern world, at the
expense of all taxpayers.
Fifty years ago the masses were exploited by
big business. Today the masses and ail business
are exploited by all taxing authorities, whose voracious appetites recognize no limits. They will learn
in time that even prosperity can be taxed to death.

I think that is about the point we have
reached in this country, because for some
time our taxes have been so high that they
interfere with production.

The leader of the government said, and I
agree with him, that surely a well managed
business should endeavour not only to balance its books but to have a surplus. But
when, in order to ýcreate a financial surplus,
you do things that cause your production to
fall, I consider that you are acting unwisely.
The average Canadian is disturbed about all
this loose money that is floating around. If
you want to see how some of it is being

MARCH 28, 1952
spent you need only go down the Montreal
road and look at the immense office building
of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: A permanent edifice.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes, a permanent edifice.
And then we have the Prime Minister's house,
built without a tender. When there is a surplus there is extravagant spending all down
the line: when labour is taxed heavily, men
refuse to work overtime. In England I am
told there is an arrangement whereby labour
is given a reduction in taxes in lieu of overtime pay.
One thing I wish to mention in connection
with the survival of any country-and it may
apply to Canada-is the need for willingness
on the part of the people to work. We al
know the seriousness of the world situation
today, and for that reason I think the government should spare no effort to avoid strikes
and pay increases, and to bring about greater
production. I recently had an interesting conversation with an employer of labour who
had visited Great Britain, France and Germany. His prediction was that even though
Germany had been defeated she would become
the greatest nation in the world, just because
her people were wi'lling to work. This man
went amongst the workers on scaffolds and
elsewhere, and told of seeing men working ten
hours a day, and how those who were able
bodied returned to work in the evening
without further compensation. This is what
men who are interested in building their
nation will do. He went to France and to
England, where he said men took a week to
do what the Germans were doing in two
days. There is no hope for a nation whose
labour is not doing its very best.
I should like for a moment to criticize the
government for its lack of wisdom in guaranteeing loans totalling $12 million, for the
building in the Quebec shipyards of ships to
be used by a Chinese organization called
Ming Sung. The ships are gone, and the
$12 million remains unpaid at the Canadian
banks. The conduct of the government in this
regard was nothing but sheer carelessness.
The honourable senator from Charlotte
(Hon. Mr. Doone) in his recent remarks
praised the government for its prompt action
in stamping out the foot-and-mouth disease
in Saskatchewan. I would like to offer some
criticism of the lack of promptness in dealing
with that problem. While there d'oes not now
seem to be any indication that the disease
will spread further, honourable senators may
have read in the press that various communities in the United States have cracked a
quarantine on certain shipments of Canadian
55708-10J

cattle. This stock must have come from
the Regina area, or such action would not
have been taken. But the whole matter seems
to have been badly handled. I used to have
a book on the disease, and I know that ail
the books on horse raising contain pictures
of animals suffering from it. Surely the
government could have diagnosed this trouble
sooner than it did. I understand now that
there is to be an interprovincial embargo
placed against the shipment of meat. That
seems quite unnecessary, because with proper
inspection of the animals there need be no
concern as to the quality of the meat.
Now honourable senators, in these few
remarks I have placed before you as best
I can, the position of Saskatchewan. We in
that province are anxious to do our part in
relieving the common plight of the world
today. I am still of the opinion that the
supplying of food is a means by which we
may avoid a further war. I believe that
we should go right on producing, and that
that portion of our products which we do not
need should be given to those whose need is
great.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Burchill was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 64, an Act for granting to
Her Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1953.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the second
time?
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: With leave of the
Senate, I would move second reading now.
This is the interim supply bill to which I
referred at the opening of the sitting this
afternoon. Have I the permission of the house
to proceed with the explanation?
Some Hon. Senators: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the understanding
which has applied to such bills as this in the
past also apply to this one?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Very well.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: This bill has just been
passed in the other place, and I am advised
that there are now a few copies available on
the Table.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do I understand that it is
for only a portion of the general estimates?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. This is the usual
bill which comes to us about this time of the
year, making provision for interim supply for
a certain period in the new financial year,
commencing April 1, 1952, and would permit of the more immediate obligations of the
various departments being taken care of,
pending passage of the final supply bill at
the end of the session.
Section 2 of the bill makes provision for
one-sixth of the estirnates for all the services,
and is intended to cover the requirements of
this country for the two months of April and
May. As honourable senators will recall from
the estimates which were placed before us
some time ago, the total estimate for the
year was $3,160,000,000. One-sixth of that
amount is $526 million odd, as asked for in
section 2 of the bill represents the cost of
services for the next two months. Additional
proportions requested for certain special
items are necessitated by the seasonal and
sessional nature of the services affected. In
no case, however, is the total amount of any
item being asked for.
As I said, the first amount asked for under
this bill, in section 2, is $526 millions odd,
which is one-sixth of the whole estimates for
the year.
While most types of expenditure run more
or less evenly throughout the year, there are
a few items which require in a given period
more than the usual one-sixth allotted under
this measure. These are the special expenditures which are listed in Schedules A, B, C
and D attached to the bill, and which are
provided for under sections 3, 4, 5, and 6
respectively. Perhaps the house would like
a short explanation of each of these sections.
Section 3 of the bill would grant an additional sum of $2,395,000; that is, five-twelfths
of the item set forth in Schedule A. This
amount is required because of the heavier
expenditure early in the fiscal year for freight
assistance on western feed grains.
Section 4 provides $526,000, or one-third of
the two items set forth in Schedule B. Those
items are: health of animals, and the Canadian International Trade Fair. The first of
these items requires an additional expenditure to ensure that owners of destroyed

animals are compensated promptly for their
loss, especially during the current outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease. With regard to
the Canadian International Trade Fair item,
and the early date of the fair, which is to be
held in Toronto from June 2 to 13, requires
that provision be made for the greater part
of the funds necessary to cover the expenses
of that fair.
Section 5 is to provide $340,000, or one-sixth
of the amount of the three items listed in
Schedule C. These items cover the principal
administrative costs of the Senate and the
House of Commons for the coming year. This
amount is required, of course, because parliament is sitting early in the year and the
major part of the expenditure is necessary
during the first few months of the current
financial year.
Section 6 asks for approximately $257,000,
or one-twelfth of the amount of the three
items listed under Schedule D, which relate
to the departments of Citizenship and Immigration and of Trade and Commerce. The
additional amount constituting the first of
these items is required because of the difficulty of financing distant overseas offices on
the same basis as local expenditures, and the
fact that accounts from these offices are
usually a month in arrears in arriving in
Canada. With regard to the Trade and Commerce items, additional proportions are
needed since the inspection services carry on
the major part of their work during the
spring and summer months, when inspectors
are able to travel freely.
In reply to a remark which my honourable
friend the leader on the other side (Hon. Mr.
Haig) made a few minutes ago, the passage
of this interim supply bill, should the bouse
see fit to approve it, does not preclude any
honourable senator from questioning any
item in the estimates which will come up for
consideration from time to time throughout
the remainder of the session.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: With leave of the
Senate, now. I so move.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, March
31, at 8 p.m.

SENATE
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Friday, March
28, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech and the motion of
the Hon. Mr. Howden for an Address in
reply thereto.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to make any extended
contribution to this debate, but before the
vote is taken I should like to make a few
remarks on a subject which is particularly
urgent in the province which I have the
honour to represent.
Before I do that, however, I should like
to congratulate the previous speakers in this
debate. I think their addresses have been
informative, interesting and eloquent. In
fact, it seems to me that the whole debate
so far has been on a very high level and has
maintained the reputation for which this
chamber is noted. I particularly enjoyed
the speech of the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), who gave us an enlightening
sketch of the days before yesterday, the days
of Sir Robert Borden. I also liked the speech
of the senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte), especially his remarks on the
derivation of the word "Dominion."
The
honourable member from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw) made a very able contribution to the debate. As for my friend from
the Maritime Provinces, the honourable
senator from Milford-Hants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins), he and I have been associated in the
lumber business of the east for a good many
years, we have co-operated in a good cause,
and I know something of the contribution that
he bas made to the industry in the Maritimes.
He made a splendid address the other afternoon and "did himself proud." Also I wish
to mention my honourable friend fram
Charlotte (Hon. Mr. Doone), from my own
province of New Brunswick. It is a good
many years now since I first met him-I
think it was back in 1906. We have been
friends ever since, and I feel sure everyone
will agree with me when I say that, like
good wine, he improves with age. Certainly
everyone who heard his very eloquent
remarks on Wednesday last will concede that
he possesses great eloquence and power as
a public speaker.
Many of the participants in the debate have
referred, and quite properly, to the fact that
for the first time since confederation we now
have a Canadian as Governor General.
Because of this new departure we really are
writing a new chapter in our country's history
at this session of parliament. With the others
who have spoken I share pride in the fact
that we have so developed as a nation that our

ability to manage our own affairs is generally recognized.
Perhaps the chief credit
for this is due to the heroic actions of Canada's
warriors in the two world wars. Of course,
our industrial growth and development here
in Canada have had much to do with our
improved national status. And it should be
a matter of pride for us all that we have a
Canadian who, by his training, his ability and
his record is qualified for the high post of
Governor General. I do not go along with
those, if there are any, who see in his appointment any lessening of the connection with
Britain. I do not think that I am any less
a Canadian if I say, quite frankly and openly,
that I have deep admiration and veneration
for the great qualities of the British people.
It has been these qualities down through the
ages, as exhibited at Runnymede and elsewhere, that have made the British a free
people. This constitutional government of
ours, our justice, and our liberty, were
developed not by us alone here in Canada, but
by the British peoples as a whole.
The culmination of those events was
reached, perhaps, during the recent war,
when British endurance and heroism rallied
to the historic words of that great Englishman, Winston Churchill, who said:
Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties,
and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire
and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years,
men will say, "This was their finest hour."
Honourable senators, the spirit which
inspired these words and the debt which
free men the world over owe to Britain is
something which Canada in ber growing strength may well cherish and make use
of. The pathos and tragedy of it all is that
when a visitor from this continent today
goes to England and then to Europe, be
comes back wondering who won the war.

The important thing to me about the selection of a Governor General for Canada
is his fitness as a true representative of the

Crown above all parties in the state, regardless of which British Commonwealth country claims him as a son.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: I should like now to
pass on to a subject which is of great importance to the province of New Brunswick,
namely, the shortage of electrical energy.
I make no apology, honourable senators,
for discussing it in its relationship to the
St. Lawrence waterway project. That great
national undertaking is no doubt sound and
worthy of support, but I have yet to discover how it will help to solve the problems
of the Maritime Provinces.
I am not dis-

cussing it in its relation to or its effect upon

MARCH 31, 1952
the great national ports of Halifax and Saint
John, but rather in relation to the problem
of scarcity of electrical energy in New Brunswick. The shortage of ýpower in that province has for some years been such that
energy could not be supplied to any more
industries than the province now has. This
situation was clearly shown during the years
1940 to 1945, when it was inexpedient for
new industries to locate in New Brunswick;
indeed, they were bound to go anywhere
else, simply because of our inability to
furnish them with power.
The New Brunswick Power Commission,
which administers and distributes power in
New Brunswick depends primarily on energy
produced by burning coal at three power
stations: Minto, producing 46,000 horsepower; Saint John, 17,500, and Chatham
12,500. A new site is being developed on
the Tobique river-which runs into the
Saint John-by means of which an additional 20,000 horsepower will be generated.
These stations will take care of our domestic demands for the next four or five years,
but willl leave no margin for any appreciable
industrial expansion. The long-term plan
which the commission have prepared after
a lot of work, is based on the integration of
steam coal plants and hydro plants, each
employed as water-flow circumstances dictate, to secure the greatest amount of
power at the least possible cost.
The New Brunswick Resources Development Board, of which the honourable senator from Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr. Pirie)
is a member, and which is under the chairmanship of a very able engineer, Dr. Harry
J. Rowley, who was brought to the province
seven or eight years ago, has been making
a most exhaustive study of the power possibilities of New Brunswick and has come
to certain definite conclusions and recommendations which it has submitted to the
government, and which the government have
adopted.
In brief, these recommendations are that
the Saint John River, which drains a watershed of 26,000 square miles, offers the best
possibility for cheap power for the province.
Engineers have determined that several
developments, each of 50,000 horsepower,
can take place on the Saint John River
provided storage facilities can be obtained
outside the province of New Brunswick. That
is where the rub is, because, unfortunately
the watershed of the River Saint John lies
largely in the State of Maine and the province of Quebec-principally in Maine. The
Resources Development Board through the

New Brunswick government, have made
representations to the International Joint
Commission. As honourable senators know,
that commission was created in 1909 by
virtue of a treaty between the United States
and Great Britain, and as it controls the
boundary waters between Canada and the
United States, it was necessary to furnish
it with a full and complete statement of
the situation, accompanied by a request that
it should investigate the storage possibilities and recommend their development.
These representations were made in October
1950 by the New Brunswick government;
and what is known as an engineering field
force has been studying them ever since.
It consists of American engineers working
together, and engineers of the Canadian government working in conjunction
with
engineers from the province of New Brunswick and the chairman of the New Brunswick Resources development Board.
I understand that a preliminary report
has been made, and it is expected that the
final report will be presented in June. The
reports will be remitted from the field
engineering force to the engineering board
of the International Joint Commission, and
from that board te the commission itself.
The federal government have been kept in
touch with these proceedings, and have been
most co-operative; they have concurred
in everything which has been done. The
Department of External Affairs has been
in correspondence with our people in New
Brunswick, and is working, I believe, to the
same end. Tonight I plead with the government to do everything they possibly can to
further the project and bring it into being
as quickly as possible. I might go so far
'as to say it is New Brunswick's only hope.
The people of the province are most anxious
that everything be done to support our case
and speed up a recommendation from the
International Joint Commission.
The economy of New Brunswick is built
on wood. Of its total area of 18,000,000
acres, 80 per cent is covered with forest.
The seven pulp and paper mills within our
borders used last year 1,216,000 cords of
wood; but unfortunately 700,000 cords were
exported beyond Canada, and another 443,000
cords went to mills in other provinces. I
should add that between two hundred and
two hundred and fifty thousand cords came
into the province from Quebec. Also we exported from fifty to one hundred thousand
cords of pit props.
This, as honourable senators will realize, is
a tragic state of affairs. Without adequate
power and manufacturing facilities we cannot

SENATE
process our raw products. The promising
young men who have been educated and taken
degrees at our universities must find employment outside New Brunswick, because there
is no employment for them in their own
province. Honourable senators, I put it to you
tonight, I put it to the government, I put it
to the bar of public opinion, that New
Brunswick is deserving of some consideration.
I say that if a national project such as the St.
Lawrence waterway can be undertaken at
the public expense, the expenditure of public
money on a provincial power development
which will ýbe self-liquidated over the years
is equally justifiable. I notice that the honourable senator who is chairman of the Finance
Committee (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has left the
chamber. I am sorry he has gone because
I am sure he would agree that it is as fair
and economically sound to spend money on
the project I have described, which will provide much needed employment to the people
of our province, as it is to provide funds for
so vast an undertaking as the St. Lawrence
waterway.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the honourable senator
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill),
before he leaves this subject, permit a question? Maybe I am dense, but I do not yet
know what he wants us to do. Just what is
needed on that Saint John river to develop
power, and how can we assist in that
development?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The development of the
Saint John river is dependent upon storage
facilities in the State of Maine. I do not know
what the cost will amount to, but it will be
beyond the resources of New Brunswick, so
we are looking to the federal treasury to aid
in financing the necessary facilities. Does
that clear up the point?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, that is what I wanted
to know.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My honourable friend
has made no mention of power being derived
from the ·tidal waters of Passamaquoddy Bay.
Has anything been done about that?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I did not mention that
because, as I understand it, the engineering
staff of the New Brunswick Resources
Development Board have decided that the
Saint John River Development project has
priority.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The other one has been
dismissed?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I do not know what
its status is, but I think it is agreed that the
St. John River Development project has
priority.

The management of public affairs could
not be much more difficult than under present conditions. In saying this I am thinking
of the Government of Canada, and I sympathize with the government, because it is
constantly under pressure to spend money for
almost every conceivable purpose and criticized at the same time is because taxes are too
high. It is not popular to impose heavy taxes,
and I have no doubt that the government is
exploring every possible way to avoid making the burden any heavier than necessary to
carry on the defence program and the public
services of the country on a level demanded
by public opinion and all parties in
opposition.
I can see the danger of too high taxes to
the industrial life of the country, and I feel
quite sure that this knowledge is shared by
the Minister of Finance, who has a heavy
responsibility. I have every consideration
for the minister; he is doing a very difficult
job. When the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) rises to speak in this chamber
he generally makes a worth-while contribution to our work. I always enjoy listening to
him, but I feel bound to say that I do not
think he was on sound ground when, in taking part in this debate, he criticized the
Minister of Finance for having a larger surplus than he counted on. I do not think the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg proved
quite fair to himself with his further argument. Mr. Micawber's old theory about the
difference betwen happiness and misery is
just as true today as in the days of Dickens,
both for nations and for individuals, and I
think Mr. Abbott is to be commended in this
case for being conservative in the right way.
As to finances, I wish to confine myself to
a suggestion which I hope will be regarded
as helpful. I think that government expenditures-and I am thinking particularly of
defence expenditures-should be carefully
screened, in order to guard against the tendency to become too extravagant. I know
that ministers are advised by technical men
who sometimes make recommendations without giving too much consideration of the cost
factor, and ministers who are not trained
technicians must find it difficult at times tomake the right decisions and recommendations.
Even doctors, as I think my honourable friend
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) will
admit, sometimes disagree on a diagnosis. I
have had some experience in dealing with
technical advisers, and not being technically
trained I have had difficulty in making
decisions.
What brings me to this point is something
that occurred recently at a certain airport.
This airport had been purchasing its milk
from a local co-operative creamery. For some

MARCH 31. 1952
months pasteurized milk was supplied, but
the airport authorities insisted upon homogenized milk, and as a resuit an homogenizer
and a milk filtering systern were installed.
Last year a new pasteurizing machine and
the most modern of automnatic b>ottie washers
were added. Then suddenly this creamery,
which distributes approximately 1,500 quarts
of milk a day, had its airport -contract cancelled. It was claimed that the bacteria count
of the milk was too high. In any event,
powdered milk was substituted, and new
apparatus and equipment were installed to
produce the milk powder. I do not know what
this cost but it certainly was not done for
nothing.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Where does the powdered.
milk corne from?
Hon. Mr. Burchili: I do not know, but it
does flot corne from New Brunswick anyway.
This co-operative creamery, in its struggle to
become established, has had the assistance of
the provincial governent of New Brunswick.
Its existence means a lot to the farmers of
the -community. Incidentally, it is stili seiling
milk to the homes of the airýport -personnel.
It is difficuit to understand why it was necessary for the airport authorities to cancel. the
contract and bring in powdered milk. I
am not a d'octor, so I do not know whether
the right thing was done; but I am wondering
whether it was necessary to cancel the contract and go to the expense of instailing new
equiprnent. I mention this because it makes
me wonder if our defence expenditures could
not be screened so that our dollars could
be watched a littie bit more closely.
Honourable senators, I have spoken a littie
longer than I contemplated, but before I
resume my seat I want to join with my
honourable friend, the leader of the opposition, in the sentiments he expressed the other
day when, in discussing the unbappy world
conditions and the continued threat of war, he
referred to the need for men and nations to
practise the code o! the golden rule. I came
across a story the other day in a book by
Fulton Oursier, in wbich be told of an
elephant, "Bozo", which had become mad and
unmanageable, and had attacked its keeper
on three occasions. Finaily it was adjudged
"dangerous", and was sentenced to be shot.
The firing squad was ail ready to do the job,
wben a smallisb man came along and asked
the keeper's permission to enter the cage.
The keeper declined, saying the animal would
destroy anyone who came within its reach.
But the stranger persisted, and handed his
card to the keeper, together with a written
release from indemnity if any damage
occurred. The stranger was then allowed to
enter the cage. As soon as be got inside, the

elephant rushed at him, as if to attack; but
when the man spoke a few words in a gentie
voice, and in a language unknown to the
keeper, the whole atmosphere suddenly
changed, and the animal became quite docile
and followed him around quietly. Shortly
afterwards the man came out and said to the
keeper: "The elephant is not mad any longer.
In fact he is perfectly ahl right now. You see,
he did not understand you. He cornes from
India, and he recognized the words I spoke to
bim." After the stranger had gone the keeper
looked at the card, and saw that it bore the
narne "Rudyard Kipling".
In about 1900, at the time of the Boer war,
Rudyard Kipling wrote a poern cailed "The
Absent Minded Beggar," the refrain of which
was: "Pay, pay, pay." Well, this old world
bas been paying for wars ever since, in more
ways than one. Perhaps sorne day we shal
find a language that peoples everywhere will
understand, a language tbrough which statesmen o! ail nations will be able to reach men's
hearts and remove distrust and suspicion. If
that happens, there wiil be peace; but in the
meantime we must armn for the defence of
our lives and our hearths-bearing in mind,
bonourable senators, in these days o! high
tension, our responsibility as leaders of the
state.
The Address was adopted.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators
are aware that the main reason for our
meeting this evening was to facilitate, if
possible, the pas-sage o! supply. The interim
.supply bill was passed by the Senate on
Friday and is awaiting Royal Assent. It is
hoped that a further supply bull will come
over to us from the other house this evening.
In the circumstances I see no alternative but
to move that we adjourn during pleasure, to
reassemble at the cail of the bell.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

The sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators
are perhaps aware that discussion on the
supply bill in the other house is still going
ýon; therefore, there is little hikelihood of
this measure reaching the Senate tonight.
Under the circumstances, I move that this
bouse do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed, to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.M.

Prayers and routine proceedings.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the Acting Speaker informed the
Senate that he had received a communication from The Assistant Secretary to the
Governor General acquainting him that the
Honourable Patrick Kerwin, Judge of the
Supreme Court of Canada, acting as Deputy
of His Excellency the Governor General,
would proceed to the Senate Chamber today,

Assent to certain bills.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 94, an Act for granting
to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1952.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the
second time?
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: With leave
of the Senate, I move that the bill be read
the second time now.
Honourable senators will recall that the
interim supply bill was passed here on Friday
last. The bill now before us covers certain
supplementary estimates for the public
service for the financial year which ended
yesterday. The amounts of money to be voted
under the bill are in addition to those
originally voted, and are now required
because of various circumstances which could
not have been readily foreseen.
The total amount to be voted under the bill
is $246,542,813. I shall not attempt to explain
each of the hundred-odd items set forth, but
shall content myself by referring to some
six items constituting in amount about 86
per cent of the total, and perhaps by making
brief reference to a few of the smaller items.
If any questions are asked I shall do my best
to answer them.
I may say that I doubt whether it would
be possible to have any detailed discussion
of many items in the time that is at our
disposal in the present circumstances. Un-

doubtedly certain aspects of some items are
of very great and more than passing interest,
and I probably would not be in a position
to give full information about them. However, I did secure from the Department of
Finance an undertaking that if our Finance
Committee should in its wisdom wish any
further explanations than I am able to give,
departmental officers will be only too pleased
to answer questions and furnish information.
While of course most of these supplementary
estimates refer to specific items for the last
fiscal year, most of them are of a continuing
nature.
The items that are outstanding in amount
are Nos. 584, 585 and 586, totalling roughly
$103 million. These provide for government
contributions to the Civil Service Superannuation Fund, a deficit having been
revealed by investigations which were made.
Honourable senators will probably recall that
last year there was an item with respect to a
very material deficit in the fund. Yesterday
I tabled a report, copies of which are available for honourable senators, of the operations of the Superannuation Fund over a
period back as far, I think, as 1931, and up
to and including December 31, 1947. The
report set out on one side the liability of
the fund under existing circumstances, and
on the other side the actual cash reserves,
and indicated that there was a deficit of some
$250 million.
Honourable senators may recall that the
matter was considered last year, and it was
determined that when circumstances permitted, various contributions would be made
so as ultimately to put the fund on a sound
actuarial basis. The sum of $75 million was
appropriated for that purpose, and Item 586
now provides:
. . . for the transfer to the Civil Service Superannuation Account of the second instalment of a
special government contribution of a portion of
the amount by which the estimated liabilities exceed the balance of the account, $75,000,000.

That, I would point out, is the second $75
million to be applied on the old balance.
It is apparent that several factors contributed to this deficit; and the reason it
accumulated in the intervening period, as
shown by the report which I tabled yesterday
covering the period from 1931 to the end of
1947, is that these factors were not taken into
account in the matter of contributions. One
such factor is the steadily increasing salary
scale, and the fact that pension payments are
based on average income over the past five
or ten years. It is quite obvious that if the
increase in the rates of pay was not taken
into account and the necessary adjustments
made, a deficit was bound to result

APRIL 1. 1952
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question on
that point?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: After the transfer has been
made to this account, what deficit will
remain?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As far as I am able
to estimate it, as at the end of December 1947
there was a deficit of about $250 million. The
item before us refers to the transfer of a
second $75 million, and if my calculations are
right there will remain in the old account
a deficit of some $100 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that the superannuation is based on the average salary over
the past five years.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think so, but I am
not sure. As salaries have gone up the
obligations of the fund increased, while the
contributions by the government and the
individual remained on the original basis.
A further factor which may well have some
bearing on this problem is an increase in
life expectancy which was not anticipated
when the original basis was determined.
Further, I have no doubt that the interest
earnings on the fund are now considerably
less than originally contemplated.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is partly covered here.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
So this particular estimate covers a provision of $75,000,000 towards meeting that old
deficiency. Honourable senators will note
that under item 585 there is a further amount
of $23,000,000 by way of contribution to the
superannuation fund in respect of additional
liability consequent upon the salary increases
effective December 1, 1951. This represents
an attempt to deal with additional liabilities
as they arise. Apart from what outlays may
be incurred in respect of the increased salary
scale, a further liability falls on the superannuation fund.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The deficit should not be
increased any further.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No, and subsequent
contributions as and when circumstances permit would be aimed at putting the fund on a
self-sustaining basis. To answer my honourable friend's question, I would say that the
deficit is in the neighbourhood of $100,000,000.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why do we not pay off
the entire deficit? Why make a limitation of
out$75,000,000 and leave $100,000,000
standing?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I suppose the idea was
that if the government undertook to pay the
deficit from current revenues without having
the necessary funds, they would have to

borrow. Apparently it was thought to be
easier and simpler financing to adopt the
policy of ensuring that the old deficit was not
increased, and of gradually reducing that
deficit, the amount of which, as the report
indicates, was determined as at the end of
1947. The question is quite a technical one,
and I think it could well be given further
consideration by the Finance Committee. I
have done my best to explain the matter as
I understand it, but it is quite complex and
involves very large sums of money, not only
in respect of the civil service but of the armed
forces as well. I repeat that it will require
more consideration. Honourable senators will
recall that last year there was a good deal of
discussion about changing the terms of the
annuity legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask whether, if these
moneys are paid, all present and contingent
liabilities will be met? Will the fund then
be solvent, and can it be carried on without
any further liability? Also, over how many
years do these arrears extend?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: A special commission
of actuaries was assigned the responsibility
of making a report on this matter to the
Minister of Finance. I have not at hand a
copy of the report, and I speak from memory,
but I believe that it was submitted to the
Minister last August. In any event, it was
in the light of that report that parliament
appropriated the first $75,000,000.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No actual cash payment is
involved, merely a bookkeeping transfer to
this account of a portion of the surplus.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, but if there were
no surplus it would be necessary to borrow.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Quite so. But there is a
surplus.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Item No. 584 is to provide slightly less than $5,000,000 for a government contribution to the superannuation
fund in an amount equal to the estimated
current and arrears payments of individual
contributors in the previous fiscal year. As
I understand it, that is a yearly item. To
begin with it is only an estimate, and
apparently is required to take care of the
amount which the government must pay into
the fund.
So there are three items: a yearly of $5
million, one of $23 million to take care of the
incidence of increased salaries, and a third
one of $75 million. These stand against the
outstanding deficit of $250 million.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I understand it, the
fund is not bankrupt at all. I suppose that
in the judgment of the actuaries it is not
sufficient to meet its obligations as the years
go on.

mnade of the report, I arn sure honourable
senators would fl.nd that a discussion based
on it would be most illurninating.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are copies stili available?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes. I tabled it yesterday, and copies are available.
There are also specific contributions, for
instance, to the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, who apparently are treated separately.
Specific increases are provided for here.
The next largest item is No. 608, which is:
To provide for the transfer to the Old Age
Security Fund of the amount by which. the pension
payments from the fund exceed the receipts into
the fund during the fiscal year 1951-52, which is
,estimated at $57.000.000.
Honourable senators will recali that under
the Act setting up this fund there were three
sources of revenue, each based on taxes at
the rate of 2 per cent. While it is estimated
that the sum total of the revenue from these
sources in a year will be sufficient to take
care of the liability, some of the revenue
will not accrue to the fund in strict mathematical. proportion to the obligations, and it
has been understood from. the first that there
would have to be a temporary advance to take
care of the deficit until such time as the full
revenues are coming in. This item is an
advance rather than an expenditure.
I fear that I was perhaps only partly right
in the answer I gave to my honourable
friend frorn Halifax-Dartmouth. <Hon. Mr.
Isnor), with respect to item 584. This item is:
To provide for a governmnent contribution to the

Superannuation Fund in an amount equal to the
estimnated current and arrears payments of individual contributors in the previous fiscal yearFurther amnount required, $4,943,977.
I arn advised that in the past when civil
servants became permanent they were required to, pay a contribution for their service
as temporaries if they wished that temporary
service to count in qualifying them for pen-

sion. But the government did flot match any
made by employees in those
circuinstances. The purpose of this item 584
is to enable the government to match such
contributions for prior service. The minister
said that the governiment planned to make
contributions in the future as actuaries
advised it to do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Item 640, for slightly
more than $15 million, is the usual further
supplementary vote to cover the operating
deficit of the Canadian National Rallways
arising in the calendar year 1951.
Hon. Mr. Haig: How much does that make
the deficit in 1951?
contributions

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think that is the
amount of the deficit on current account.
Honourable senators know that a deficit
occurs each year, but it seems to me that
this is larger than the amount has been in
the last f ew years. During the war or just
after the end of the war there was, I think,
a time when the railway system had a
surplus.
Han. Mr. Lambert: Once.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Once or twice, and
since then there has been a deficit.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I amn not sure that I heard
what was said. Is this the total deficit of the
Canadian National for the year 1951?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think this is the
deficit on current account.
Hion. Mr. Euler: Does it include interest on
the funded debt?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Oh, no, not the
interest.
Item 654 votes the imposing sum of $37,999,966 in connection with the Polymer Corporation Limited. I amn advised that this is purely
a bookkeeping item, and flot an expenditure at
ail. AU the assets of the Polymer Corporation are vested in the Crown, but evidently it
was thought the part of wisdom to have the
corporation set up as an ordinary company,
with assets and liabilities, and, in place of the
assets which stand to compensate for the
advances, the total stock and capitalization of
the company are to be vested in the Crown.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Can the leader tell us
whether that corporation is making or losing
money, and to, what extent in either case?
Han. Mr. Robertson: I would not undertake
to state any amount, but I arn advised that
the operation has been a highly profitable
one. I believe the minister made a statement
about it, and a report has been issued. This
item results from. a change in the set-up.
I think the same comment applies to a
relatively small vote in connection with the
Atomic Energy Control Board. That is item
656. It is anticipated that this board is perhaps reaching the revenue producing stage
in an ordinary commercial way, and the intention is to have it placed in the category of
a Crown Corporation.
Some senators have asked me about the
vote to compensate Lieutenant Governors for
their expense accounts. The .vote is in item
658, amounting to, $21,500:
To authorize, effective from January 1, 1952, and
provide for annual expense allowance to, the Lieutenant Governors of the provinces of Canada, to
reimburse themn for costs of travelling and hospitality Incurred in the exercise of their duties, up
to the ainounts of not less than $5,000 and not more

SENATE
than $12,000 per annum in the case of any Lieutenant Governor and within those limits not more
than an amount of $5,000 per annum plus $1,000 per
annum for each 100,000 or fraction thereof by which
the population of the province at the last decennial
census exceeded 500,000.

As I understand it, applying this to the
larger provinces, Ontario and Quebec, and
perhaps British Columbia, the ceiling would
be $12,000. For some of the smaller provinces,
such as Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, the ceiling under this formula would be
$5,000; and for Nova Scotia, whose population was shown by the last census to be somewhere between 600,000 and 700,000, it would
be $7,000.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is this a new item, or is
it in addition to what has been paid?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is expenses, and
has nothing to do with indemnities.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But did the government
pay something for expenses in the past, and
if so, is this in addition to that amount or
is it entirely new?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It is new.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would think so.
I was asked a question about Vote 610,
under Post Office, which reads:
Transportation-movement of mail by land, air
and
water,
including
administration-Further
amount required, $1,614,000.

I am advised that this amount is made up,
first, of $914,000 increased rail expenses
caused by the higher rates in effect last year;
second, some $300,000 of an increase in the
cost of rural mail deliveries; and third, about
$400,000 the increased cost of carrying transatlantic mail. However, in the light of the
recent statement of profits on the operation
of Trans-Canada Airlines, this third item
is recoverable.
Perhaps I should offer some explanation of
Vote No. 653, under Citizenship and Immigration, in the amount of $6 million. This vote
is to provide for:
. . . a continuing Special Account . . . known as the

Immigration Revolving Fund, from which interestfree loans may be made to immigrants, towards
the cost of transportation to destination in Canada,
including cost of meals en route, under conditions
fixed from time to time by the Governor in
Council.

While this is a revolving account and is
supposed to be self-liquidating, I am advised
that the process of liquidation is slow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And is not permanently
liquidated.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is not rapid and the
department feels that a certain amount should
be available for this purpose.

I have covered, honourable senators, as
best I can the larger items. If there are further questions any honourable senators wish
to ask, I shall endeavour to answer them.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not intend to devote much time to discussing this measure now, because apparently
we are expected to have it passed by 5 o'clock
this afternoon. I do, however, wish to say a
few words about the $75 million item and
certain other amounts.
I am advised that the government superannuation system has not been on an actuarial
basis from the beginning. One reason for
this is that the life span has been increasing.
Further, the fund was expected to earn a
certain interest rate-say 4 per cent-whereas
today, as many of us know, the government
is offering bonds at from 2k to 3k per cent.
The loss of interest earnings affects the whole
structure of the system.
Many corporations with pension plans
similar to that of the government have found
that they have had to make additional contributions to meet deficits. Let us take an
average employee, who started out on a
salary of $2,000, on which both he and his
employer made an annual contribution of
5 per cent, or a total of $200. His salary
increased steadily, and when he retired at
the age of 65 his pension was based on his
high income period of the previous five years.
Now a plan cannot stand up under that
arrangement, because the contributions over
the many early years did not create a fund
sufficient to pay the higher pension.
I know of a leading banking institution in
this country which each year make a large
contribution to meet the deficit in its pension
fund. This year the bank authorized its
employees to continue at work until 65 years
of age rather than 60. Bank salaries increase
sharply in the last ten years of the employment and the pension which the employee
receives is based on his average salary over
those ten years.
Obviously, the average
wage earned by an employee would not be
as high between ages 55 and 60 as it would
be from 60 to 65 years. Corporations are
required to pay in large sums to keep their
pension funds healthy, and I understand that
the Income Tax Department is making allowance for such payments.
I can quite appreciate the sentiment of
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) when he asked whether
members of the civil service could afford
increased contributions. I cannot possibly see
how they could be expected to make up the
loss that has been building up over the years.
That is particularly true in the light of the
present high cost of living. Although I am

APRIL 1, 1952
not one who thinks that civil servants are
underpaid, I see no possibility of individual
employees being able to make greater contributions to reduce the deficit.
In 1905 the city of Winnipeg inaugurated a
systen of pensions for its school teachers.
A teacher who started out on an annual
salary of $1,000 .contributed so much towards
a pension, and as his salary increased so did
his contribution. Now the average starting
salary is perhaps $2,000, and the method of
making contributions towards pension at a
certain age is not today actuarially sound. The
school board has revised the scheme, and now
all teachers who have come on the staff within
the past few years are put on a plan which
is actuarially sound. But for those persons
who are under the old plan, the school board
has to put up so much money annually until
superannuation age is reached.
I think the proper procedure for us would
be to refer this subject to the Finance Committee of this house, and let it call the officials
who can explain the details and give the
facts. After proper investigation the government could at some future date, say January
1 next, establish the fund on an actuarially
sound basis, and all new employees would
enter under a proper system. If the facts are,
as bas been said, that the increase of salaries
in the year 1951 created a deficit of $23 million, then we have to provide for about four
years, and by that time the deficit, instead
of being $100 million, is more likely to be
$200 million. Also, I think the rate of interest
on money paid in should be equal to the rate
prescribed by the government. These are all
matters upon which I think the Finance Committee could make effective contribution.
I have a further thought which I should
like to express, and in this regard I would
ask Mr. Speaker's indulgence in not calling
me to order.
There has been much agitation about the
proposed extension of annuities. This pension
plan is much like an annuity scheme: it is
a promise to pay so much at the end of a
certain tern of employment. But the government has never done what insurance companies do every year, namely, go over their
statements and see whether in the light of
changing circumstances their scheme is actuarially sound. Two years ago we had before
one of our committees an official from the
Annuities Branch, and he pointed out that
they were trying to beat the table a little by
calculating that life expectancy had advanced
from 70 to 72 years and basing their calculation on that figure. Nevertheless, I think that
the whole matter of pensions and annuities
should be considered by the Finance Committee, which could call before it experts

from the life insurance companies and large
corporations like the Canadian Pacific Railway to tell us what they actually take into
account in arriving at an actuarially sound
pension plan. In that way we could determine
the basis on which the government system
should operate. That we have discovered only
in the year 1952 that our pension fund is not
sound is, it seems to me, a reflection on parliament. We as senators-and I am one of the
guilty ones-should have known of that condition long ago. Although I have been a
member of this chamber for sixteen or seventeen years, it never entered my head that
the system would incur a deficit of anything
like this aniount. Of course Canada can pay
it. Although there is only $85,000,000 in the
account to meet liabilities of $330 millions,
we can make up what is owing. But that is
not the way the country's business should
be run. These schemes should be on an
actuarially sound basis.
This bill contains many other items which
I am not going to discuss, but I must enter the
sarne protest which I have made every year
that I have occupied my present position in
this chamber. Something has been done by
the Finance Committee to minimize the force
of my complaint. But the fact remains that
this bill deals with no less a sum than $246
millions, that we meet this afternoon at
3 o'clock to consider lt, and that we are told
in no uncertain terms that the Governor
General or his Deputy will be here at 5
o'clock, so the bill must be passed at once.
No doubt all my confreres are men and
women of great abili.ty, but I do not believe
that even they can give adequate consideration to items of this size in so short a time.
I do not know what the solution is. I admit
that the Finance Committee is making a
determined effort to improve the situation.
But I do not like the system at all.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would not the solution be
to bring the estimates down earlier?
Hon. Mr. Haig: According to the Minister
of Finance, to whom I listened recently in the
other place, there are estimates which could
not be brought down earlier because the
minister did not know what the figures were.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In any event they are
only estimates.
Hon. Mr. Haig: While it is, I know, against
the rules to criticize what is done in the
House of Commons, I must say that I am
unable to understand the procedure there.
No subject with which that house has to
deal is more important than supply. Were
it not for the money it is empowered to levy
and to vote, the House of Commons would
not exist. For generations the Commons have
fought for their right, as representatives of

SENATE
the people, to say how money shall be voted.
But what happens? Members talk about
various items, but they do not get down to
actually voting the money until the last ten
days before a recess, and these bills come
to us three or four days prior to adjournment. When I go home I am asked, "Why
did you not object to this or that item?" My
reply is "We never had the chance."
A final word, and not by way of criticism.
I wholeheartedly support the proposed
increases of indemnities to the lieutenant
governors, and I do so more readily since the
lieutenant governor and his lady, in the
province from which I come, have given us
such wonderful service. On the lst of N6vember next the Lieutenant Governor of
Manitoba will have held office eleven yearsLet some of your backward provinces match
that record!-and nobody can be found to
take his place. The only murmur of criticism
I have heard is that if, on New Year's Day,
you go to the Lieutenant Governor's reception a sober man, you come out sober. When
his honour was a civilian and active politically, I was wholly in disagreement with him;
but in his present capacity he and his wife
have rendered magnificent service to our
province. I do not believe that any of their
predecessors were as well known as he and
his lady have come to be. Our present
lieutenant governor has covered every part
of Manitoba; be makes no distinction of
religion, class or race; he has imbued the
people with feelings towards the Crown
which may be equalled in other provinces
but which, I venture to say, have never been
surpassed. And let me add that with all his
entertaining and other official obligations he
cannot be getting rich very fast on an allowance of $9,000 a year. Either we should
abolish the position and have the duties
performed by the chief justice or some other
functionary, or we should provide for it in
such a manner as to make it worth while.
In Manitoba about 50 per cent of the population consists of immigrants from continental
Europe and their families, and it is a fine
thing to have, in Government House, a fitting
social centre, and in the lieutenant governor,
one who inspires these people and the rest
of us with the feeling that we are all one in
trying to carry on worthily for the good of
the province and of Canada as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My friend has mentioned the figure of $9,000. Is income tax
charged to a lieutenant governor?
Hon. Mr. Haig: He has to pay it.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Then be does not
actually get $9,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He is in the sane position
as a member of the Senate. When a senator

receives $6,000 he has to pay tax on it. The
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) would insist that we pay taxes on
our indemnities.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Absolutely. I have some
doubt, though, whether income tax is paid
by a lieutenant governor, as ordinarily the
representatives of royalty are not subject
to it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The income tax law does
not exempt them. I don't think the government trusts lieutenants governor any more
than senators: tax deductions are made
before cheques are issued.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
may I say at the beginning that lieutenant
governors are in the same position in this
matter as are the honourable members of
this body; that is, the salaries or emoluments
they receive for the high office they occupy
are subject to taxation.
When one looks at these supplementary
estimates one ceases to wonder at the wide
variety of taxation and the skill of the tax
imposers and tax collectors in reaching everywhere to get a little money.
First I make an observation on this further
supply for His MajestyHon. Mr. Beaubien: Her Majesty.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -Her Majesty, which
applies to the fiscal year that closed yesterday. It is a great joy to have so near to me
my honourable friend, to keep me on the
straight and narrow path! I have forgotten
the precise amount, but I draw attention to
the fact that our main estimates a year ago
were of the order of three and a half billion
dollars. Before the end of the session last
year, supplementary estimates amounting to
about $200 millions were brought in. At the
close of the financial year we find these
further supplementary estimates, totalling
$246 million, being brought in. Is it not a
matter for some reflection that we are voting
nearly
$450
million in supplementary
estimates for the fiscal year that ended
yesterday?
What are supplementary estimates for? I
want to deal with this because a bad practice has grown up which should be stopped.
Supplementary estimates had a very different
place in the old days when the conduct of
public business was not so free and easy as
it is today. Honourable senators are familiar
with the procedure of preparing estimates.
Towards the end of the calendar year, somewhere around November, the Minister of
Finance notifies all his colleagues that he
wants them to prepare and submit to Treasury
Board the estimate of expenditures they think
they will require in the next fiscal year.

APRIL 1, 1952
Those estimates are finally gathered together
in what we call the Blue Book, and are tabled
in both houses of parliament shortly after
the session begins.
The main estimates
should cover the requirements of the individual services for the fiscal year, unless something extraordinary and unforeseen should
arise. This was so in the old days; but nowadays we have drifted into the easy and careless habit, apparently, of not estimating
accurately when the main estimates are
brought down. As a result we are forced to
crowd in supplementaries in huge amounts
as the fiscal year draws to a close, and thus
we have today's spectacle of almost a quarter
of a billion dollars being required for last
year.
This is bad in an administrative way,
because the officials of the various departments tend to grow careless. They say,
"Weil, it's all right. If we want something
and there is a fight about it now, we will put
in a supplementary for it". In my judgment
this practice in the handling of the fiscal
business of the government is growing to an
alarming degree, and it should be stopped.
The Finance Minister is too tender with the
departmental heads. He needs to be stern
and tell them that their main estimates must
be in by a certain date, and that they are not
to prepare them on the expectation of getting
several hundred millions of supplementaries
within the next fiscal year. If this were done,
parliament would know what money it had
to vote. Just what value have estimates got
if they do not accurately reflect what the
government proposes to spend in the year for
which they are voted?
Turning now to an examination of the
bill before the house, I would say that the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
was quite in order in discussing annuities,
because there is an item in these estimates
dealing with annuities.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, I know.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not intend to make
any extended contribution to the discussion
on the superannuation fund. The honourable
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) mentioned a few of the factors that had
changed the basis of the superannuation calculation. A person entering the service some
forty years ago contributed so much out of
his salary towards his superannuation, and
the government contributed the rest. In
other words, the total of both these contributions theoretically provided a fund that
would meet the superannuation payments.
But life expectancy has increased. At that
time many people thought that a man reaching sixty-five would probably die at seventyfive; but it is quite a different matter if he

is going to live until he is eighty. If any
criticism could be offered here it is that this
fund was not put upon a sound actuarial
basis years ago.
There are a few items in these estimates
to which I should like to refer. One has to
do with the Department of Labour, and I
am quite in order in discussing it. Vote 593
deals with the Annuities Act. There appears
a long description in rather small type, and
an item of $1 is provided for something or
other. When I see a provision for an item
of $1 in the estimates I always think it is
worth a good second look.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have had only very
limited time to examine this item, and so I
do nothing more than draw it to the attention
of the house. In vote 611, under the heading
of Post Office, there is apparently an item
of $1 to bring an employee of the Post
Office under the superannuation fund. I do
not know what that means. Probably it is
quite in order, but it is one of those things
that members of parliament should take a
look at.
Vote 636, under the heading Marine Services, reads:
Construction or acquisition of vessels and new
equipment-capital-further
amount
required,
$948,550.
If in the main estimates the authorities
in the Department of Transport under-estimated this expenditure for marine services
by close to a million dollars, then they were
not on the job. This unfortunate practice
of doing things will tend to increase if we
do not check it.
Next I would refer to vote 65b. Here is an
item for the External Affairs Department of
$600,000 to provide, subject to regulations of
the Treasury Board, for working capital advances. Now, if we were not under the
necessity of getting these items through this
afternoon, I think this is a vote which should
be explained. Why does the External
Affairs Department require working capital
advances? "Working capital advance" is a
term used for the advance of money as, for
instance, to the Canadian National Railways
or the Polymer Corporation or any other of
the Crown companies. But from a hasty reading of this, one gathers the impressionwhich of course may be quite wrong-that
the money is to provide a sort of revolving
fund within the department. If that type of
fund is to be set up, should we not be told
a little more about it? It may be that my
criticism is quite unjustified. I merely draw

SENATE
attention to this item as one of those about
which additionai. information should be
becured.
These votes will go through, but it is a
matter for concern that the main estimates
submitted a year ago were so far short that
the government has had to come along and
ask for an additional sum of practically $450
million to cover the twelve months. That, in
my judgment, is not good housekeeping.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Honourable senators, I
wish to ask the leader of the house a question regarding item 653, under Citizenship
and Immigration. During the past year I have
been interviewed by a great many intending
emigrants from the Old Country, and I was
asked a number of questions which unfortunately I could not answer. As I understand
it, under the present regulations an emigrant
to this country from Britain is required to
put up £10, or something under $30 at the
current rate of exchange. Is this vote of $6
million intended for the establishment of a
fund out of which to lend money to emigrants
to cover the balance of their ocean fare and
their railway fare to point of destination in
Canada? If so, can the leader tell us what
method is used for keeping track of the
emigrants after they arrive here and collecting the money back from them?
I recently crossed the ocean in a ship carrying about 500 persons emigrating to this
country; I talked to a good many of them
and am convinced that they will make good
citizens. I am just wondering whether out of
this vote moneys will be lent to such people
to enable them to pay the balance of their
transportation expenses; and, if so, what
method is used for seeing that the loans are
repaid.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am afraid I cannot
answer the question as to what machinery is
used for collection of the amounts lent. This
vote is in addition to the $3 million provided
under item No. 648 in Appropriation Act
No. 2 of 1951, which was exhausted some time
last fall. The purpose of this vote is to
provide for a continuing account known as
the Immigration Revolving Fund, from which
interest-free loans may be made to immigrants towards the cost of transportation to
destination in Canada, including cost of meals
en route, under conditions fixed from time to
time by the Governor in Cou-ncil. I can only
presume that the money is collected back
from immigrants through the labour organization offices and employment agencies throughout Canada. I do not undertake to say that
every dollar advanced will be repaid, but I
believe that by and large the experience up
to date has been reasonably good.

Hon. Mr. Horner: The minister said in
another place that 200 immigrants had disappeared and there was no hope of getting
any money back from them.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The number was larger
than that. Thousands have disappeared.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The department has no
trace whatever of such people, and no doubt
there will be a lot more of them.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
perhaps I shall be pardoned if I say that
this discussion seems to me rather futile,
because of the fact that we cannot do much
about this bill. It has never been recognized
in the past that the Senate has the duty of
scanning and perhaps rejecting certain estimates. In general practice the Senate is not
supposed to take any action with regard to
the appropriation of moneys. I do not agree
with that, but that has been the practice.
I say that the discussion is more or less futile
because the questions asked about some items
could not possibly be answered by any one
person. I do not blame the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for saying
that he cannot give answers, for much of the
information asked for could be obtained only
in conmittee. Now, as I understand it, it
is not intended to send this bill to committee.
Instead, I believe, we are supposed to pass
it by five o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Euler: So we must make up our
minds either that we will not pass these
items until we have an opportunity of
examining them in committee, or that we
shall pass them this afternoon without obtaining any real information about them.
I also wish to refer to what was said a few
moments ago by my colleagues from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). He bas had some experience in the preparation of estimates-and, as
a matter of fact, so have I. He said the
Minister of Finance is too easy. I do not agree
with him on that. At least, that was not true
of any Minister of Finance with whom I came
in contact. My experience was that when the
Minister of Finance asked his colleagues in
the government for their estimates he constantly urged that the amounts be kept down.
And, under that pressure, ministers do endeavour to keep their estimates down to some
extent, perhaps often knowing that it will
be impossible to get through the year on the
amount of money asked for. The inevitable
result of this system is a demand for supplementary supply. It may be argued that whatever amount the Minister of Finance asks for
in the main supply bill is all that he should
get. Yet, it would not be quite practical to
limit him in this way, for departments can

APRIL 1, 1952
hardly avoid incurring expenditures that
were not foreseen at the beginning of the
fiscal year.
However, I do think there is something to
my colleague's point that the amount of
money asked for in a supplementary supply
bill should not be as large as $250 million or
$300 million. Indeed, I believe he said that
the total of the supplementary estimates for
the fiscal year just closed is about $450
million. I may be criticized for what I am
going to say, but I will say it. I feel that we
are spenling entirely too much money in this
country. We have just about reached the
point where the people will not stand for
these heavy expenditures any longer. I say
that advisedly, because of what a great many
people have told me. It is my opinion that
most people are just about fed up with the
large amount of taxes they have to pay. I
think it might be pretty difficult to justify
some of the expenditures at this time, even
for what we call defence, I say that with a
certain reluctance, but I believe it to be the
fact.
Now I come back to this supply bill, which
we are supposed to pass by five o'clock.
Under what necessity are we to approve these
supplementary estimates? I know that if a
sufficient amount to -cover civil service salaries to the end of the fiscal year is not appropriated there will be a delay in the payment
of some salaries, and that would cause a good
deal of dissatisfaction and injustice. But this
bill has nothing to do with civil service salaries at all. For the life of me I cannot see any
reason why these estimates should not have
been brought down in time for us to have
referred them to a committee and obtained
information from departmental officials. Had
we done that we could have dealt with the
items intelligently, without feeling, as we
must now, that we are acting like a set of
rubber stamps.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I should like to direct a question to the honourable leader. While I am not quite in
accord with the remarks just made, I realize
that the leader is not in a position to answer
all questions.
My attention is drawn to one item which
I think should be viewed with a sense of
humour. Vote No. 587 reads:
Contributions towards the National Wornen's
Organization Program in connection with the
prosecution of a thrift campaign, not to exceed

$10,000.
True, the amount is not great in these days
when provinces are spending by the hundreds
of millions and the federal government by
the billions. But I am wondering where this
thrift campaign has taken place, and what
province benefited by it.

I realize that al expenditures cannot be
foreseen. For instance, Item 629 pertains to
the visit to Canada of Her Royal Highness
Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh.
But I turn next to Item 607, which has to
do with Indians and Eskimos health services,
and provides for an additional $1 million.
Surely, the department concerned could have
estimated within a million dollars what its
costs would be. My opinion is that although
the Minister of Finance may be severe when
the estimates are down, the departments have
found a way of getting around the situation
by making extraordinary expenditures and
bringing them down at the last moment.
I should like some explanation in reply to
my question about the thrift campaign.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I presume the explanation is that the funds were used to educate
the public as to the need for thrift in all
matters.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We should have given them
a million dollars, if it would have helped any.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Of course we are
directing our efforts toivards the curtailment
of spending and not the increase of it. Perhaps when the main estimates are brought
down my honourable friend's suggestion will
be adopted. But I am unable to give him
any realiable explanation of that item at this
time.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I understand that the
explanation for this item is that a number
of women undertook a campaign to encourage
people to economize in their buying and so
on. Some money was spent on travel and in
other ways, and a contribution of $10,000
was made towards meeting those expenses.
I hesitate to ask, but could this organization
have been composed of Liberal ladies?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perish the thought!
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) referred to Item 642, and as it is of
interest to the province from which I come,
I should like to comment on it. The item
reads:
Canadian National (West Indies) Steanships,
Limited-To authorize the write-off from NonActive Assets to Consolidated Deficit Account of
the balances of advances or loans ($3,618.505.74)
made to the Canadian National (West Indies)
Steamships, Lirnited. Notwithstanding any other
Act, Interest shall cease to accrue on this amount
on and from January 1, 1952 ...

The report is ýabroad that these ships are
to be sold. They are getting old, and perhaps
they are a bit outmoded, but I am interested
in knowing if they are going to be replaced.
If not, will the money received from theii

SENATE

sale go into the Consolidated Revenue Fund
or will it go to reduce the deficit of the
Canadian National Railways?
I note that the deficit of the Canadian
National Railways is $15 million odd; to that
amount there is added $1,280,000 and $85
million for the Prince Edward Island car
ferry and terminals deficit. Then it is proposed to write-off the assets or loans to
Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships.
The total of these three amounts is considerable. We must not lose sight of the fact that
when the Canadian National Railways writes
down its assets, the public has got to pay.
This may be a convenient way of financing,
but such a public enterprise as this does not
face the tests and trials of private enterprise.
This is a good example of the difference
between a public enterprise and a private
venture.
The member from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) also referred to Item 636, under the
heading of Marine Services:
Construction or Acquisition of Vessels
Equipment-Capital-Further
arnount
$948,550.

and New
required,

For anybody to say that this is evidence of
inefficiency is, to my mind, not justified. Those
who know about the shipping business and
the cost of repairs at the present time know
that it is impossible to estimate operating
costs. Even in the matter of house building,
the owner may find that the construction cost
him one-third more than he estimated. We
must not lose sight of the fact that we have
recently taken over Newfoundland, and as a
maritime province it has no doubt required

extensive marine services; it may be that
more ships were purchased, or refrigeration
was installed in some ships, and that this
was not considered necessary when the
original estimate was made. Criticism of
such items as indicating inefficiency on the
part of the Finance Minister, it seems to me,
must come from an uninformed mind. We
are today in difficult times, and it is hard to
estimate what expenditures will be. The
Minister of Finance is criticized because he
underestimates his revenue and overestimates
his expenditures; but I have been in public
life long enough to know that one does not
worry about surpluses, the problem is the
deficits.
It seems to me that while our economy is
buoyant, as it is at the present time, we
should create surpluses, and they will stabilize
us in times of depression. We must realize
that we have paid off a considerable portion
of the public debt of this country. Does
anyone suggest that this should not be done
in good times? We can recall previous wars
which were fought on borrowed money, and
that we were years reducing our debt. Now

we are in a position to almost pay as we goa most enviable position.
If there is one field in which Canada has
excelled, it is in the financial field. Her
financial structure is the envy of many
countries. It must be said that down through
the years the public servants who have been
in charge of our fiscal arrangements have
done a splendid job. For instance, if one
goes to the bank today to buy American
money one no longer pays a premium but gets
it at par. It is a great day for Canada, lying
as she does alongside the United States, to
find that her dollar will buy as much as
the American dollar. That situation is something the Minister of Finance can be proud
of; and to say that he should be able to
estimate his expenditures more closely than
he does is, in the light of the times, unjust
criticism.
There was a time when we could legislate
by statute; a bill was passed, and it became
law. Then we found that we could not
legislate by statute, because what was good
law one day might be bad law the next, or
vice versa; so we resorted to legislation by
order in council. The same applies in matters
of finance. The old method of estimating
requirements until the end of the year and
insisting that all expenditures be held within
the amount estimated is outmoded.
We
are on a new road, and we have to adopt new
ways. To criticize the government because
it has too large a surplus and cannot spend
all the money it has collected seems to me
unrealistic.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) argues that taxation is so
high that the people cannot stand it. As a
matter of fact, it is lower than in most countries. Furthermore, I do not believe that
the people of this country, notwithstanding
what they have to pay, ever had a more
abundant life than they have at the present
time. While all of us hate to pay taxes, and
we know that governments are extravagant,
and what they do is less carefully done than
is the business of private enterprise, our
over-all condition is one with which we can
be very well satisfied. My only word of
criticism is that we should have a little more
time to intelligently inform ourselves through
our Committee of Finance as to the subjectmatter of the estimates.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
if there is no further discussion I should like
to comment on one or two remarks that have
been made. I agree with those who feel that
there has not been enough time to consider
the public estimates. So far as I know, there
never has been. But I repeat what I said
at the beginning, that a good many of the

APRIL 1, 1952
matters comprised in these items are continuing expenditures, and that the Finance
Committee is in a good position to consider
them in principle with an eye to the future.
Few of them are in the category of nonrecurring items.
In the course of the discussion I ventured
to give the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) my recollection
of the amount of the deficiency at the close
of the year 1947. What I said was approximately correct, but it may be well to state
what is contained in the report of the
actuarial examination of the superannuation
account and the consolidated revenue for the
period March 31, 1931 to December 31, 1947.
I tabled this report yesterday. The conclusion of the compilers in respect of the
fund as it then stood was: reserve required
to meet future obligations, total value of
benefits, less total value of future contributions-because, of -course, some claims would
accrue for some time-estimated,
not
$341,149,000; balance in account, December
31, 1947, $89,544,000; leaving a deficit of
$251,605,000.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Before my honourable
friend leaves that point, can he tell us on
what rate of interest that is computed?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The original basis, of
course, was 4 per cent: I do not recall whether
it has been changed.
As to future earnings, I am advised that
contributions of 6 per cent by civil servants
and by the government, with interest at 4
per cent, will support the fund so long as
there are no changes in the general level
of salaries, and contributions for past service
are made both by employer and employees.
The normal increase in the salary scale during
the career of the civil servant is taken into
account. If at a particular time a general
over-all increase in the salary structure
takes place, specific provision will have to
be made if the account is to be kept on an
actuarially sound basis.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the reason for the
$23,000,000 item?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes. Perhaps I was
not entirely accurate in intimating to the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that since 1947 the account had been
maintained on a sound basis actuarially. That
may not be so, because the deficit at the
end of 1947 was about $250 millions. I am
informed that the Minister of Finance
estimated the deficit as of December 31, 1951
to be $312 millions. That, of course, antedates any of these appropriations.

I will refer only briefly to one or two other
points which were brought up. An honourable senator referred to vote No. 593 in the
Department of Labour, under the Annuities
Act. The practice of inserting an item of $1
is one which I find confusing, and I usually
try to obtain an explanation. The explanation
with respect to that dollar item is that the
department was advised that, pending an
amendment of the Annuities Act, contracts
between employers and employees must be
changed by Act of Parliament whenever there
is a transfer of employees to new employerswhose names are specified in the details of
the estimates. An amendment to avoid the
necessity for this proceeding was introduced
in the other place last year, but was not
then proceeded with.
The other $1 item, which will be found
in the Post Office group, has to do with a
change of attitude towards a certain employee
of the Department who was discharged for
some irregularity and who in consequence
lost his superannuation benefits. It was considered that in view of the somewhat technical character of his offence, this treatment
was harsher than should have been meted
out to him, and this procedure has been
adopted to make it possible to deal with him
in a less severe manner.
As regards vote No. 655 of $600,000 under
the Department of External Affairs, as my
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) indicated, this is a revolving fund. It
provides for advances to officials going to
foreign stations and requiring, for instance,
tropical clothes: from this account moneys
can be advanced to them, to be repaid over
a period of years. Whether any better method
of providing for such expenditures could be
evolved is a matter of detail into which,
perhaps, the committee may have an opportunity to inquire.
The bill was read the second time.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2
SUPERANNUATION FUND

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should like to refer
to the discussion of the Civil Service Superannuation Fund that took place yesterday
during the debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill 94, dealing with supplementary estimates. Certain statements
were made about the period prior to retirement during which the average salary is taken
as a basis in determining the amount of
superannuation to be paid. It was said-and
I did not disagree-that in some cases this
period was five years, and in others ten
years. The facts are these: The superannuation of all employees who contributed to the
Retirement Fund prior to 1924 is computed
on the basis of their average salary during
the last five years of their service; the superannuation of those who have come under
the Act since 1924 is based on their average
salary during the last ten years of their
service.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.

RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

APRIL 2, 1952
are proposing to extend to the Japanese
the favoured-nation trade policy which shc
enjoyed before entering the war.,
I would point out that Canada depends
more than any other nation on her export
trade, and that over the years trade polidies have changed considerably.
In 1939,
40 per cent of our export trade was with
Great Britain and 37 per cent with the
United States.
In 1951 the picture had
entirely ýchanged, and only 16 per cent of
our export trade went to Great Britain and
59 per cent to the United States. When I
look over the export trade figures, I arn
flot Sa enamored of sending the greatest
portion of our goods across to the United
States. The outbreak of the foot-and-mouth
disease and the embargo against Canadian
,cheese has shown us how trade arrangements with that country can and do change
overnigaht.
I arn wondering what the Canadian people
are going to say when they discover that we
have extended the favoured-nation policy to
Japan and that ber goods are starting to
corne to this country. Are we goîng to, shut
them out because they are cheap? Let us
flot f orget that we have stripped Japan of
bier possessions,. that we, need her strength
in the Orient against the present regime in
China and the threat of the Soviet. Are
our 'businessmen goîng to cry to high heaven
against trading with the Japanese because
some Canadian factory cannot meet the
competition?
I would remind honourable
senators that in 1939 we sold to Japan some
$30 million worth of goods; and I need
bardly say that trading should be a twa-way
arrangement, th-at we cannot expect a country to buy from us if we are flot prepared to
buy from. it.
In passlng I should perhaps say a word
about those nations that have recently been
trading with Soviet Russia. It would be
interesting to know just what nations are
doing such trading.
While Great Britain
has restricted her trade with us because
of a lack of dollars, I believe Canada did
not go far enough in her representations
last year when Russia was allowed to ship
huge quantities af grain to Great Britain in
exchange for important machinery.
I mention this because of samething which
it will take the Canadjan people a littie while
ta live down. Recently, shipload after shipload of automobiles, in ail about 10,000 cars
which had been sent i good faith by British
manufacturers to this country, were returned
ta Britain because of credit restrictions
imposed here. That is a fact which should
be borne in mind when we refer ta the
exehange of British-made machinery for
55708-11i4

Russian grain. We in Canada migbt have
faund a way of encouraging reciprocal trade
with Britain, not anly in aur mutual înterests,
but for another reason which should not be
averlooked. There are in this country Communists who decry the statement that but
for Britain the whole af Europe would today
be dominated by Hitler's Germany. I have
heard them extolling the performances ai
Russia during the Iast war, but there is no
man who can successfully contradict the statement that, had Britain collapsed wben France
callapsed, Germany today would dominate
the whole of Europe. Had it been possible
for Germany ta turn hier full armed might
against Russia, that great country would have
been beaten; but the United Kingdom in
holding the gate against the Hitierite hardes
for herseif, held it also for Soviet Russia and
for this country, and for the United States
as well.
With regard ta matters comprised in the
trade treaty, I should like ta take a minute
ta speak about immigratian. At this Urne,
I understand, there are awaiting approval
same three thousand applications from
Japanese to enter Canada. I arn not naw
going ta repeat what I have saîd i days
past in the other place with regard ta
Japanese immigration. But let me say this:
it is an very weil for people living fifteen
hundred or three thousand miles fram the
danger zone, and naw that the war is aver,
ta decry what was done during the war years
in removing the Japanese fram the British
Calumbia caast. But think af the situatian
at that time. Japan was a powerful military
enemy. No ane knew where she would
strike. Exposed ta invasion was a coastline
extending from the Yukon ta the Mexicati
border, and it is naw known with certainty
that but for disagreements on strategy among
the Japanese authorities, their armed forces
wouid have launched an attack on this continent. It happened that the dispute ini the
high command was won by the air farce and
the navy, and as a cansequence the enemy
struck at Pearl Harbour. Meanwhile, we ini
British Columbia were living alongside
thousands af Japanese. Many of them openly
admitted that they were there in the interests
af Japan; some boasted that they wauld soan
rule this country; and tbousands af their
boats were scattered along aur entire coastlime. Witbout doubt many ai these people
were spies or spotters. Living under candi..
tions af blackout, nat knowing where or when
Japan wauld strike, could we afford ta leave
the Japanese where they were? Yet, because
they were removed ta the interior and ta
eastern points, for the safety af the nation,
those ai us who favoured that mavement
have 'been held ta blame.

SENATE
I repeat that it is easy at this distance of
time and place to say that that was a terrible
thing to do; but it is rather amusing to note
that among some of the most vociferous
critics of our treatment of the Japanese in
British Columbia are people who are parties
to regulations and arrangements which prohibit Jews and coloured people from owning
property or settling in certain areas where
these same people live or own property. So
it seems that while it was all wrong for us
to do something to protect ourselves against
the Japanese, it is quite right for others to
discriminate against Jews or members of the
coloured races. I have often wondered how
people can hold such contradictory points of
view.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable
senator a question. I can understand his
attitude with regard to the Japanese during
the war, but does he think that the treatment
Japanese property-owners received after the
war was fair and honourable?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am glad that the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) has asked me that, because it gives
me an opportunity to cover the question a
little more fully. The government at the
time was faced with the problem of what to
do with the property which these Japanese
had vacated. If in the interests of the national
safety it was right to move these people, they
had to be taken away from their homes and
their properties. Two considerations were
before the government. The boys and the
parents of the boys who offered theniselves
for our defence were asking: "Are you going
to allow the Japanese to carry on and retain
their properties while Canadian soldiers are
overseas hazarding their lives,-many of
them, perhaps, never to return?". Also, as
soon as the occupants vacated their properties,
deterioration began. Some of the damage was
caused by mischievous people who are always
ready to do harm to any vacant property,
whether Japanese or not. We all know that
if a house is left empty for a week, one or
more windows will be broken, and if it is
unoccupied for a month, the window frames
and the doors probably will be gone. So, of
course, this property deteriorated when the
Japanese vacated it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But not through their fault.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am about to deal with the
matter of price, because I know that is
regarded as all-important. The government
appointed a commission of, I believe, five to
value the properties. Again, now that the
era of fear has passed, there will be those
who would discredit what was done. But at
the time this property was valuated and
bought by the Canadian government for our

soldiers, you could have gone into the Fraser
Valley and purchased better property for less
than the government paid for the Japanese
holdings. I state that without fear of successful contradiction. In the year 1940 property
in British Columbia sunk to the lowest level
in my experience. Not only Japanese land,
but any property, and as far back as the
interior of the province, was to be had for
from half to a quarter of its original cost.
The government valuators were men of
experience, and they paid for the property
more than it was really worth at that time.
In other words above the market value at
that time. Of course, when Japan capitulated
and the war ended, property values increased
-and they are still increasing. As I have
said, one must realize the conditions at the
time the Japanese were moved and the properties sold, and I repeat that it cannot be
denied that the prices paid were more than
the properties were then worth.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Why, then, did Canada
provide another quarter of a million dollars
from the federal treasury to increase the
purchase price?
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is another story. It
was just done to placate certain interests. I
could have purchased better property in the
interior of the Fraser Valley than the Japanese
property, and for less money than the government paid in 1940. That is something I know
about.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I know something about
it too.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I want to put something on
the record nowHon. Mr. Euler: I do not like to interrupt
my honourable friend, but I would like it
understood that when I made reference to the
Japanese people I had in mind those Japanese
who were born in Canada and are Canadian
citizens.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If honourable senators want
to spend the whole afternoon on this subject I
would be delighted, because these are questions which I can easily answer. I believe that
the Japanese, including those who are
Canadian born, are the only race who have
claimed and enjoyed dual citizenship in this
country. Until the outbreak of the last war
every Japanese born in Canada had his
birth registered in Japan and was claimed
as a Japanese citizen. As a matter of fact
all Japanese fishermen employed in British
Columbia were listed in Japan's year book
as nationals of that country.
I understand that at the present time half
of the 3,000 prospective Japanese immigrants
were born in British Columbia and left our

APRIL 2, 1952
country ta take up arms against us. Now that
their country has been defeated are we
gaing ta welcome them back? I disagree with
those who would allaw this class ta return.
Persanally 1 feel that you cannot mix whites
and Orientais any mare successfully than you
can mix the white and black races. I holdthat ini the case of intermarriage the Oriental
absorbs the Anglo-Saxon. We could neyer
absorb them. Previaus ta the war, when a
Ja-panese died in British Columbia his death
certificate was sent ta Japan. This is further
evidence of the fact that Japan had a particular interest in the Japanese Canadians in
British Columbia. Why is it that before the
war those Japanese who were born in Canada
woulcl not renounce their Japanese citizenship? Not one of them would get up and say
'II arn a Canadian, and I want nathing at al
ta do with Japan." 0f course, they will do
it now because Japan is defeated. There is
no doubt that the Japanese wanted ta gain
control of the North American continent, and
had it nat been for the Americans they might
have achieved their ambition. I say that
when we are in committee we should ask the
government about these things. Is Canada
again gaing ta allow a mixture of races ta
be built up on the Pacific coast? I do not
know the answer, but I should like to hear the
view point of the government in connection
with this part of the treaty. I understand
that the government is awaiting the passing
cf this treaty before it will decide upon the
entry into Canada of these 3,000 Japanese.
I arn willing ta hazard the guess, however,
that the whole 3,000 will settie in British
Columbia.
No mention is made in the treaty about
Japan's attitude towards the fur seal fishing
industry. At one time a sealing agreement
was reached to presýerve the great seal herd
off the Pribilof Islands. This treaty, with
only two signatories, is still in, existence.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Is Russia a signatory to that
agreement?
Honourable
Hon. Mr. Reid: Not now.
senators wîll recali that just before Japan
struck at Pearl Harbour, she signified her
intention of withdrawing from this sealing
treaty. At one time the seal herd was greatly
reduced as a result of the ruthless slaughter
of the seals; and so I should like ta know
towards this
attitude
present
Japan's
agreement.
There are other matters affecting the
Japanese Peace Treaty which should be discussed in committee. For instance, many
Canadians have substantial dlaims for property damages, and I for one would lîke ta
know what has happened ta the hundreds of
thousands of prisoners af war. The Canadian

public should know something about these
things. Canadians living in the central provinýces and in the Maritimes have looked
towards Great Britain and Europe for centuries naw, and perhaps they are not as
intersted in what happens in the Pacific as
they might be; but 1 arn one who holds that
we had ahl better take more notice of what
happens in the Orient.
I wonder how many honourable senators
are aware that Soviet traders are now offering goods which are in short supply in India
and Japan in trade for other goods. As a
matter of fact, the Soviet is flooding western
Germany, and even Britain, with propaganda
expressing willingness to trade in goods that
bath these countries lack. Russia is even
offering ta sell coal to Japan at $10 per ton as
against United States coal at $30 per ton. It
shauld be noted that in 1951, as part of the
Soviet 'cold war, we had a Soviet-inspired
peace signature campaign. Honourable senators wil recali how many thousands of
Canadiang were duped into signing these
sa-called "peace" cards, only ta find that they
were Soviet inspired. This year there is a
Soviet world wide economie drive for trade,
and Stalin hapes ta undermine the unity of
the allies by ex.ploiting the present unbalance in world trade. Russia is ready to
furnish raw materials ta war-weakened
Europe and the Far East, and ta buy their
capital goods in return.
Attention should also be paid ta the World
Trade Conference ta be held in Moscow on
April 3. It has been said that the conference
will seek ta improve the living standards of
through peaceful
peoples
world's
the
co-operatian, but in reality the conference
aims ta split the countries of the free world
and extend the ruble bloc. The Soviet,
although not a signatory to the Japanese
Peace Treaty, nevertheless maintains a seat
on the Allied Council and keeps hundreds of
its trade officiais and other members of its
staff in Tokyo. If the Soviet signs a bilateral
trade treaty with Japan, it might make the
present Japanese Peace Treaty abortive ta
quite an extent. As I have already pointed
out, the Soviet was given Sakhalin Island,
and this brings Soviet guns close ta the Island
af Hansu, the capital city of which is Hokkaido. It was decîded at Yalta ta strip Japan
of these islands and af its coal reserves, and
fisheries, and of its sources of supply of milk
and manganese on the Island of Honsu.
Now I want ta caîl attention of honourable
senatars ta the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance
and Mutual Aid which was entered into by
Soviet Russia with the peoples Republic of
China on the 14th of February 1950. This
is of interest ta the Canadian people,

Just this morning I received in the mail
a copy of the Vancouver Sun of Monday,
March 31, in which I noticed an interesting
report of an interview with Hon. W. C. Woodward, president of one of the large department stores in Vancouver, who bas just
returned from a world tour. I shall read
just a sentence or two from the report:
"We have to open up a market here for Japanese
goods," Mr. Woodward said. "If there's no market
in the free world for their goods, 82,000,000 Japanese
will go over to the communist market. It's as plain
as that."

That substantiates the point that I have
been making here this afternoon. When
Japan is ready to start shipping goods to
us, we in this country should see to it that
we trade as freely as possible with her. In
the past we have tried to hamper J'apan in
her efforts to build up a bigger foreign trade,
but now it is in our interest to encourage
ber development, for we need her help

Too 'long we have been looking at only

that the new spirit in the Far East bas made

importance to Canada and all ber people.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I had not intended to make any remarks
at all on the Japanese Peace Treaty, but
I am rising because I believe the discussion,
while very interesting, has wandered far
afield from the subject of the treaty itself. I
am concerned, as is the senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), to see that
we treat the Japanese people properly. If
I remember rightly, my honourable friend's
former complaint was that the Japanese in
British Columbia were willing to work such
long hours that other people could not compete with them.
Let me mention just one incident to
show how the Japanese were sometimes
treated on the Pacific coast. Having had
some personal experience with the clearing
of land and the building of a bouse, I think
that I know something about the value of
property. On one occasion I was travelling
in the west within perhaps a mile of the

APEIL 2, 1952
honourable senator's own city, and I was
talking to a man whom I have known for
f orty years and who himself has been on
the land for ten years longer than th-at.
In my opinion he is a good judge of property
values. He took me to see a house that
had been taken away frorn a Japanese, a
hard working man who had caused no
trouble. My friend told me that the property was then worth $7,OO-it would be
worth a good deal more today-but that
the Japanese had been allowed only $1,700.
A thing like that causes me a great deal of
concern.
I endorse every word that the senator
said about our need to build up trade with
Japan. But, as I said the other day, I think
we are becoming over-industrialized, and
are not paying sufficient attention to the
economics and development of what is and
must be for years to corne our chief and
Cerbasic industry, namely, agriculture.
tainly we ought to produce enough milk and
butter for our own consumption, so that it

industrialized. We are now exercising certain prohibitions against Japan in the shipbuilding industry, when it is obvious that
she could build ships for a third of what
it would cost us to build them. At the same
time we are preventingc the importation of
certain British-m-ade automobiles. AUl this
is being done to protect and stirnulate Canadian industry.

The Japanese people who emigrated to
Canada have been kept, for the most part, on
the west coast. There they have made their
homes, and they know little or nothing about
making a living in any other part of Canada.
Yet, when some o! them, were forced to go
to the sugar-beet growing area of Alberta,
they were content to settie and make their
living there. If we are seriously considering
friendship with the Japanese and intend to
live up to the terms of this treaty, we should
encourage trade ýbetween the two countries
and a'llow them to migrate to and settie
anywhere in Canada.
The resolution was agreed to.

THE SENATE

APRIL 3, 1952
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I do not know if what my
honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) bas just said was meant to be a question or a statement. If it is a question, I
should have the privilege of replying to it.
I am quite sure that such a good businessman
as the honourable gentleman from WaterlooHon. Mr. Euler: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: -would be quite prepared
to pay 2 cents on the dollar to an American
market of 175 million people, if it meant
bringing into this country millions of American tourist dollars-and that is what it would
mean.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There is another aspect to
this question. It can work two ways. Up
until the time the coalition government was
dissolved in British Columbia, American
tourists in that province did not enjoy any
premium on their dollar when crossing toll
bridges or dealing in government-controlled
stores. This was true even when our dollar
was at a 5 per cent discount. The Americans
resented this treatment, and now that their
dollar is at a discount they will not like it if
they have to pay a premium.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is a case of "heads I win,
tails you lose".
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I wonder if the
honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) has endeavoured recently to
get American funds from a Canadian bank.
If he bas, I should like to know whether he
was given the advantage of a 2 per cent
premium.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He certainly was not.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am rather inclined to
think that it was far from being a 2 per cent
premium.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Orders of

SECOND READINGS

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, with
leave, I move that these bills be now read the
second time. I would ask honourable senators
to pass these bills today so that they may be
sent to the other bouse before we adjourn
for the Easter recess. I am afraid that during
our absence the members of the other place
may run out of work.
The passing of these bills today will mean
that in the last three weeks we have sent
over to the other house a total of 160 divorce
bills. That ought to be enough to keep honourable members over there busy for a while.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: An Easter egg for them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am anxious also that they
should send us some legislation, but apparently they do not realize that that is
necessary.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the second time, on division.

consent of the bouse I now move that these

SENATE
on his re-election, in 1932, he was appointed
Minister of Public Works and Chairman of
the Newfoundland Highroads Board. For
many years he served as a district magistrate,
and in this capacity travelled extensively
throughout Newfoundland and Labrador. In
1943 he was seconded from the Department of
Justice to the Department of Public Health
and Welfare, to organize a system of local
government, and from 1943 to 1946 was
Director of Local Government Affairs. In
1947 he was appointed Commissioner for
Public Health and Welfare, and continued in
this office until the Commission of Government terminated, in March 1949.
Our late colleague was an influential and
outspoken advocate of confederation with
Canada, and became the first Minister of
Health in the newly formed provincial government, later assuming the Finance portfolio.
In 1949 be was created a Companion of St.
Michael and St. George in the last Newfoundland Honours List. He was summoned to the
Senate on the 24th of January, 1951.
On behalf of the members of this house,
and particularly those on this side, I extend
to the widow and the family of the late
senator our sincere sympathy in their
bereavement.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I join with the leader of the government in
expressing our sympathy to the widow and
family of the late Senator Quinton.
Like the honourable leader, I regret very
much that I was not better acquainted with
our deceased colleague. Many of us will now
realize that his presence here gave us an
opportunity to know a man who had the
unique record of having been a member of
the Assembly of what I might term Old Newfoundland, a member of the Commission
Government that followed it, a member of
the first Assembly of the Province of Newfoundland, and a senator for Canada. For a
man of his age, our late colleague indeed had
a remarkable record, and Canada has suffered
a great loss in the passing of one whose
knowledge of the affairs of Newfoundland
was so comprehensive.

On behalf of the senators on this side of
the bouse, I wish to express sympathy to his
widow and son. They must surely know that
their husband and father contributed much,
not only to his native province of Newfoundland, but to the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, a
short time ago I was at the bedside off Herman
Quinton, and I realized then that he was
approaching the end. Today I regard it as
a great privilege to offer a word of comment
and regret upon the passing of a most distinguished Newfoundlander.

My memory goes back over many years of
the deceased senator's career. I knew him
as a young soldier in France, fighting with
his back to the wall in a regiment that was
described by Field Marshal Earl Haig as
"better than the best". I saw him receiving
recognition for service to his country at the
hands of our late sovereign King George VI,
who conferred on him one of the highest
honours available, the C.M.G. I knew him
as a great patriot, a man who loved his country and who was noted for his integrity and
sound judgment. His long years in public
life will leave in his native province a profound respect for his memory.
I think I can say without hesitation that
our late colleague achieved his greatest ambition when he became a member of this body.
His early passing is a great loss to this chamber, and to those of us who knew Herman
Quinton personally, but it is a far greater
loss to his native province of Newfoundland.
I take this opportunity of conveying to
his wife and son my deepest sympathy. We
mourn the passing of one of Newfoundland's
illustrious sons.
Hon. Vincent P. Burke: Honourable senators, as one who knew the late Senator
Quinton very well, I should like to say just
a few words about the splendid service
he rendered to Newfoundland. As a member of the Commission Government he played
his part well; indeed in every role he
assumed during his extensive public life,
he served his province well.
I am sure that all of us in this chamber,
who mourn his passing today, would wish
to express to his widow and son our sincere
sympathy.
Hon. Michael Basha: Honourable senators, yesterday was indeed a very sad day
for me when I learned of the passing of
my room-mate, Senator Quinton, for I had
known him not only since he became a
member of this house, but since 1915, when
we were boys together, and I had followed
his activities in various phases of both public and private life.
There is little that I can add to what has
already been said in tribute to the late
senator, but I wish to join most sincerely
with the other speakers in expressing my
deepest sympathy to his wife and son.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
in the passing of Senator Quinton this bonourable body has lost a valuable member,
and many of us who knew him well have
lost a good friend.
I first met the late senator some years ago
when he was one of the Commissioners in
the Commission Government of Newfoundland.

APRIL 3. 1952
As has already been said, when Newfoundland entered confederation, our late
colleague became a member of Premier
Smallwood's cabinet. Subsequently he was
appointed ta the Senate.
Our late friend was a fine hast, and any
businessman who visited him on the island
always enjoyed bis hospitality.
Senator Quinton's 11f e was devoted ta
public service, and the record he achieved is
an enviable one. He will be greatly missed
in bis own province, which. he served so
well. Although his time with us in the
Senate was short, he will be remernbered as
a man who was bath congenial and earnest,
and who gave the best of service ta the
people who during bis public career put
their confidence in hlm.

In the meantime I should like ta point
out ta honaurable senatars that the ather

and will return before the date at which the

honourable senators who live some distance
from Ottawa will govern tbemselves accordingly. I arn hopeful that by the time aur

I should like ta again draw the attention
of honourable senators ta the invitation 'wbich

Speaker ta issue on aur behaif to our distinguished American visitors who will be

May 1. On the previaus evening, Wednesday,
April 30, a dinner will be given in the Parliament Buildings to, the Honourable Guy
Gillette and the Honourable Owen J. Roberts,
an ex-Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States. The exact place bas not yet
been decided upon; it may depend on the
number of those who express a desire to,
attend. In the absence of the Wbips during
the recess, my office has assumed respansibility for distribution of tbe tickets. While
I shahl make it my business ta write persan-ý
ally ta every honourable senator, I hope that
those of aur members who are able ta do
50 will signify to my office before they leave
Ottawa whether they wish ta attend, and,
how many tickets tbey will require.
I hope the Senate will be well represented,
not only because of the personal distinction
of aur guests, one of whom is.,a member of
the United States Foreign Affairs Committee,
but because their attendance is in the spirit
of tbe resolution introduced here two years
ago by the honaurable senator from. Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Eu'ler), looking to further co-operation among the parties ta the North Atlantic
Pact. It will be a very interesting occasion.
Both of aur distinguished visitors will speak.
Ail bonourable senators who can do so will, it
is hopecl, not only attend themselves, but wil
bring tbeir wives as well. It is not expected
that the limit of accommodation will be
reached unless the demand is extraardinarily,
large.

to His Honour the Speaker.
Hon. Senalars: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: We welcome them, not
only because of the prominent positions they
occupy in their own country, but in recognition of their efforts to bring about ever dloser
co-operation between the countries of the
western world, on the success of whose joint
efforts the fate of mankind so largely depends.
The presence of these distinguished visitors
is of particular interest to members of thîs
chamber, since two years ago we ourselves
passed a resolution approving the calling of
a convention of representatives of ail political
parties of the demnocratic world which sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty, with others,
to explore ways and means by which, within
the framework of the United Nations, there
might be a dloser co-operation in ail matters
of common interest.
The events of the last two days have borne
ample evidence of the awareness of our distinguished visitors of the urgent need of
furtber co-operation among our respective
peoples.
We congratulate them on the leadership
they are displaying, and the inspiration of
the message they bring. During recent years
the negotiations leading to the creation and
maintenance of the Nortb Atlantic Treaty
Organization have resulted in the members
of the governments and permanent officiais
of the countries concerned achieving a degree
of personal friendship and understanding that
bas accomplished much in the past, and will,
I believe, accomplish much in the future.
But, as bas been so clearly demonstrated
duùring the discussions, no such relations exist

the great contribution that the -people of
the United States have been making for
several. years now in the interests of peace
and good will tbrougbout the world. We as
Canadians can proudly say ta the civilized
world that we have lived aiongside the United
States for some one bundred and twentyfive years withaut any dispute baving arisen
that cauld nat be settled by arbitration. We
are extremely deiigbted ta weicome you
gentlemen, botb as congressmen and as friends
and brothers in the cause o! freedom.
Honaurable gentlemen, on behaîf o! those
an this side o! the bouse I would ask aur
distinguished. guests, wben tbey return ta
the United States, ta tell their ýcountrymen
that we Canadians appreciate wbat tbey are
doing, -and that we join witb tbem in the
hope that the cause of freedom and peace
on this eartb will prevail in the years to
came.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hlear, bear.
Hon. Guy M. Gillette (U.S. Senator):
Mr. Speaker and honourable senators, I
should be somewhat less than human if I
attentpted ta s'ay that I was not particularly
happy at this time. I shouid. be less than
courteoius if I took advantage of titis concession, this consideration on your part in allowing us ta corne into your chamber as guests,
H-on. John T. Haig: Honourable mmes
I can rigbtly say "amen". I heartily agree with sbould I attempt ta abuse it by making a
everytbing the honourabie leader of this speech. I amn not going to do that. I apprecibouse <Han. Mr. Robertson) bas just said. ate your wonderful invitation to come uD to

distinguisbed ex-Justice of the Supreme Court courtesies that have been, ex-tended to us
of the United States, they can judge of aur here-culmlnating in titis unusual privilege

bouse receives tbem here today. It is the chamber-as courtesies extended not only ta
first occasion of the kind in eigbty-five years. aur country but te its legislative bodies, of
Neyer before have men from. another country wbich I and my colleague are members. We
been invited ta sit on the floor of this house accepted the invitation, and we appreciate
wbile parliament bas been in session. The it in the spirit in wltich you extended it.
May I just say one word in expression of a
Senate of tbe Cangress of the United States
set this parliamentary precedent, I think in thought that came to me as I waited, in the
1902, wben it received the two leaders of corridor? It bas been my privilege to attend
the Canadian Senate, the late Right Honourabie legisliative assemblies abroadý in London and
Sir Mackenzie Boweli and the late Right in Paris, and as a member of a legisiative
Honourable Raoul Dandurand. We are now body I am always ir.terested in observing the
retuTning that compliment to the Senate of ceremonies, the miles of pracedure, the vanithe United States.
ous metbols. that bave been adopted in variHonourable gentlemen, we have been en- ous countries. They differ in the respective
couraged and enlightened by the representa- countries, but there is one respect in which
tions that youi delegates have made to the tbey are absolutely sîmilar: they are simply
people of Canada tbrough these bouses of the instrumentalities of a philosophy of govparliament. I may say quite candidly that 1 ernment which recognizes the people tbernam not surprised that the Senate of Canada, selves as belng the repository and source of
one of the two bouses of pariament, should ahl power; and they are the agencies through
take a greater lnterest in this question than whicb that power is translated into rules for
any other part cf Canada. Our experience as thre goverament of the respective peoples,
legisiators and businessmen make us realize In that, as. 1 say, there is absolute similarity;

between the several legisiatures themselves,
although they in the final analysis must
approve ail decisions arrived at by the executive branches of their respective governments.
There are strong arguments in favaur of
early cansideration of what appropriate steps
could best be taken ta remedy this situation.
May I say to our distinguished visitars
how much we in this bouse appreciate the
leadership that their great country, the United
States of America, bas given and is giving
ta mankind the world over.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The road ta peace and
to a fuiler life for ail may be long and
difficuit. Many obstacles will be encountered,
and must be overcome. Nevertheiess, it is
our earnest hope -and firm belief that under
the leadership of your great country, of which
you, aur distinguished visitars of today, are
sucb outstanding examples, ail will in due
course be well.
We welcome you, we thank you for coming,
and we extend ta you aur best wishes for
continued success. You have done us a great
honour in accepting our invitation ta be
received by the Senate of Canada.
Hon. Senafors: Hear, hear.

SENATE
and differences in ceremonials-as, for instance, sir, whether you are addressed, as
"Mr. Speaker", "Mr. President", "Mr. Chairman", or by some other designation-are of
no importance whatever.
May I express another thought, and then
take my seat? I have listened to the very
gracious remarks of the leader of the government and the leader of the opposition. Now,
I see down here a corridor that separates the
government-those of you who represent the
majority point of view--and the oppositionthose of you who represent the minority
point of view.
An Hon. Senator: Not many.
Hon. Mr. Gillette: In the United States
Senate and the House of Representatives we
have a much narrower corridor separating
the majority from the minority. But notwithstanding the width of your corridor, you
senators, I am confident, have only one
thought in mind: the interest of your great
country. You may have different ideas as
to how that interest is to be served, but
regardless of that corridor which separates
you, you are working together. And I want
to say that between your country and ours
there is an imaginary line that has been
existing for a long time and will, undoubtedly,
exist for a long time yet; but over the years,
as the decades have gone by that imaginary
line has grown to mean less and less, and
I am convinced that it will mean still less and
less in the future-not that our countries are
going to be joined, but because the line is
simply a geographical one, not a line that
separates us as exemplars and advocates of
the political freedom that our nations stand
for.
Now, just this in closing: on behalf of the
United States Senate, of which I have the
honour to be a member, I thank you for all
the gracious courtesies that you have extended
to us, and I assure you that I shall carry
back to the Senate of the United States a
report as appreciative as I can express it of
the wonderful kindnesses you have shown us.
And if any or all of you will visit Washington
and call at the office of the Senator from Iowa,
who is now speaking to you, Senator Gillette,
it will give me extreme pleasure, on behalf
of our country, to show you at least some
of the courtesies that you have shown to us.
I thank you.
(Applause.)
Representative Leroy Johnson: Mr. Speaker,
honourable senators, this is a very unusual
occasion for me, for as far as I can see into
the future, this is the only Senate that I shall
ever talk to. Senator Gillette is a member of
the United States Senate, something that I am

confident I shall never be. Now, for an indication of how human you Canadians are, I only
have to look at the second item in your
Minutes of Proceedings for yesterday, which
refers to a petition of the Garrett Corporation
of the city of Los Angeles, in the State of
California. I am from California, and, as you
know, Californians always advertise their
country.
It is hard for me to express the pleasure,
and more, the knowledge and the information
that I have gained during my several days
here in Ottawa. We appreciate tremendously
your invitation to come here to consider
some serious problems with the members of
your parliament. You are just like we are,
under a cloud. The world is still divided,
despite the fact that we tried to unite it in
1945; and we, like you, are probing and studying and thinking and questioning to find a
way to unite the world so that we may have a
rule of law instead of a rule of force. That is
what we are trying to do; and representative
government all over the world, no matter
what its particular mechanics may be, is
struggling for the same thing-to find a way
whereby human beings, great populations
with diverse backgrounds, conditions, interests, and whatnot, can settle their problems
as Anglo-Saxons do, namely, by submitting
them to a court or other tribunal for decision
on the basis of evidence, equity and merit.
You are trying to do that; we are trying to
do it; but we cannot do it in a compartment
by ourselves. I have come to the conclusion,
as many other Americans have, and as you
people have, that the world is too small for
compartments. As long ago as 1920, when
Alcock and Brown took a plane from Newfoundland to Ireland, anybody who thought
about the matter for a moment could see that
the world was gradually being compressed.
And as time has gone on and transportation
has become more speedy and weapons more
powerful, it has come to be imperative, in
my opinion, that the free nations-who represent the will of the common man, and in
whom resides all the sovereignty of their
respective peoples-should' find a way to
settle international problems by peaceful and
Christian means. That is what we came up
to Ottawa to talk about.
It has been a great pleasure to meet with
you parliamentarians, and on behalf of the
House of Representatives, which is the house
that is closest to the people in America, I
want to tell you that I tremendously appreciate your invitation. We in that house are
elected every two years; we cannot get away
from the shadow of an election. Our people
look to the members of the house-I have

MAY 1 1952
700,000 who look to me-to legislate for them.
I do not want to legislate just for pressure
groups, for those who have a selfish interest
and want to get something out of the
government or out of me. If I have the
ability and the vision, I want to do something
for the people, for their children and their
grandchildren.
Think of this, my friends! More than
half of the members of the United States
Congress, including Senator Gillette and myself, have seen military service. The senator
served in three wars; I served in one, the
First World War. We are a freedom-loving
and peaceful country, but half of our legislators have participated in the brutal art of
warfare. This condition of recurring wars
must end, and only the free peoples of the
world who understand that men can get
along together can bring an end to it. They
are the people who can solve their conflicts
and differences by peaceful means, in the
courts, by arbitrations, conferences and so
forth. That is the means by which we reflect
the Christian spirit-that every man should
love his brother as himself.
On behalf of my colleagues and myself,
may I say that we are pleased and delighted,
and :consider it an honour to be invited to
meet with the members of both bodies of
your parliament. I have learned a great
deal from the experience, and I presume
Senator Gillette has too. We hope that our
efforts will bear fruit that will bring everlasting peace to the world.
It is a great pleasure to be here, and I
thank you for the honour of permitting me
to address you.
(Applause.)
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before we proceed to consider the business

of the house, I may say that I have asked
the sponsors of the various items appearing
on the order paper to ask that they stand
when they are called, so that we may have a
further opportunity of meeting personally
and talking with our distinguished visitors,
who are shortly to leave by train for their
homes.

The motion was agreed to.
RULES OF THE SENATE
ENFORCEMENT

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, I should like to point out that in my
opinion this bouse has fallen into the habit

of forgetting some of its rules. Rule 23 (f) of
the Senate provides, among other things, that
two days' notice must be given of a motion for
the second reading of a bill. I can understand
an honourable senator moving, in the case of
emergency, that certain rules be suspended in
order that a bill may receive first and second
reading without delay, but I object to this
practice in ordinary cases. If Rule 23 (f)
is improper, let us amend it.
At present, when a bill is read a first
time, His Honour the Speaker asks when it
shall be read the second time, and quite frequently the sponsor of the bill moves that it
be placed on the Order Paper for second
reading the next day. This means that the
debate on second reading often takes place
just one day after honourable senators have
first had an opportunity to look at the bill.
Most of the bills that have been placed on my
desk tonight are simple, consisting of only
one section, but when a bill has ten or twelve
sections it is an entirely different matter. I
would suggest that in future any member who
asks for second reading of a bill the next day
should give some reason for so doing. I would
make an exception in the case of divorce bills,
because it is necessary to get them to the other
house so that there will be no delay in their
progress. We shall certainly be here for a
couple of weeks yet before this session is
overSome Hon. Senafors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -and
therefore there is
no great rush to get on with the second reading of ordinary bills. In the future I am going
to object to any request that a bill be given
a second reading the next day unless its sponsor gives some good reason for it.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: I have no objection
to postponing the second reading of my
bill until Thursday.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

DIVORCE BILLS
SECOND READINGS
Hon. Mr. Aseltine, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Divorce, moved the second
reading of the following bills:
Bill W-6, an Act for the relief of Ismena
Archange Labatt Chipman.
Bill X-6, an Act for the relief of Rose
Larocque Crawford.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall these bills be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In view of what the
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) has
said about bills in general, with no special
reference to the bills which I am introducing from time to time, as I presume
there is no real emergency involved in these
bills, I shall not move their third reading
until Thursday next.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Stanley S. McKeen moved the second
reading of Bill R-6, an Act respecting the
Burrard Inlet Tunnel and Bridge Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the statute
incorporating this company was passed in
1910 and amended in 1924 and again in 1931.
The company was authorized by the Act to
build a tunnel under the First Narrows of
Burrard Inlet and a bridge over the Second
Narrows. The bridge was delayed for some
years, and then the charter was turned over
to the City of North Vancouver, the District
of North Vancouver, the District of West
Vancouver and the City of Vancouver, and the
bridge was placed in charge of a board of six
directors, consisting of the Mayor and a member of the council of the City of North Vancouver, the Reeve and a member of the
council of the District of North Vancouver,
the Reeve of West Vancouver and the Mayor
of the City of Vancouver.
Section 1 of this bill proposes to change
that, so that the Board of Directors shall

consist of two members nominated by resolution of the council of the City of North
Vancouver, two by resolution of the council
of the District of North Vancouver, one by
resolution of the council of the District of
West Vancouver, and one by resolution of
the council of the City of Vancouver.
Section 8 of the present Act makes the
Railway Act applicable to this company, and
the Railway Act authorizes the charging of
tolls; but it is necessary to amend this section in order to clarify it and ensure that
the company has authority to charge tolls
on the vehicular and pedestrian traffic which
crosses on a roadway on either side of the
railway bridge. Section 8 (3) of the bill
spells this out, and of course puts the tolls
under the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners, and section 8 (4) provides that the company may make rules and
regulations governing that vehicular and
pedestrian traffic. These rules also would
be subject to the orders and regulations
of the Transport Board.
Section 14 of the Act names certain railway companies and public utilities with
which this company may make contracts.
Two of the companies were misnamed, and
the bill contains an amendment correcting
the name of one of these to "The Canadian
National Railway Company," and of the other
to "The Pacific Great Eastern Railway Company". The bill also strikes out the name
"Vancouver Harbour Commissioners" and
substitutes "The National Harbours Board",
which has superseded the former body.
If there are any questions I shall do my
best to answer them.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to ask my
honourable friend whether the tolls chargeable are to apply to pedestrians walking
across the bridge.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: According to my
information, this bill will authorize the
,charging of the tolls which now are applicable to both pedestrian and vehicular traffle.
The Railway Act has to do only with tolls on
railways; therefore, it is necessary to clarify
the question of tolls by this present measure.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What bridge is it, the
Second Narrows Bridge?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: This is the Second
Narrows Bridge.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my friend if
there is any time limit on the charging of
tolls, or if when the bridge is erected the
tolls will continue to be charged forever?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I may say to my honourable friend that the bridge was erected in
1925, and is owned by the municipalities in

SENATE
that area. I believe that when it is fully paid
for the municipalities may be prepared to
free it from tolls. The municipalities which
own the stock in this company are the City of
North Vancouver, the District of North Vancouver, the District of West Vancouver and
the City of Vancouver. They put up the
capital and issued $700,000 worth of bonds.
When they are paid off the municipalities
will own the bridge.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is there not some talk of
turning this bridge over to the Canadian
National Railways?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: This clears the way for
action. The bridge has suffered under some
difficulties in the past. The waterfront people
thought that the draw was in the wrong
place, and suggested that the opening span
should be in the centre of the bridge. Ships
quite often hit on the bridge, until finally it
tipped over and fell into the water. The
municipalities did not have money enough
to repair it, and the Harbour Commissioners
took over the structure at a cost of $900,000.
The opening span was put where it should
have been in the first place, and the Harbour
Commissioners operated the bridge until last
year when this sum of money was repaid.
The bridge has now been turned back to its
owners, the four municipalities.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That still does not answer
my question.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: What is the question
again?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is it not true that the
municipalities are contemplating turning the
bridge over to the Canadian National
Railways?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I understand that
negotiations are under way, and almost conpleted, by which the Canadian National
Railways will take over from the municipalities the operation of the bridge.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a further
question about tolls, as I do not think the
explanation in that respect was very full?
Does the bill provide any limit on the time
during which tolls may be charged, or the
gross amount that must be collected to satisfy
the indebtedness? Is there any set profit to
be made out of it by the municipalities, or is
there any limit as to how much the public
must pay?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: There is no limitation
as to the length of time that tolls may be
charged. The fixing of tolls is within the
jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Conmissioners. Before the bridge was damaged
it showed a profit; I think one dividend of
3 per cent was paid to the municipalities.

But primarily the bridge was constructed to
assist in the development of the north shore,
opposite Vancouver, and to provide transportation to that area. I do not suppose the
municipalities concerned are interested in
making big returns from the operation of the
bridge, but they would like to have it paid
for and to reduce the tolls as much as possible. The only other means of transportation
to the area is a ferry, which is not very
satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What has been said may
be true of the municipalities, but what will
happen to the tolls if the railway takes it
over? They might be continued for a long
time.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I understand that the
railway is taking over the rail operation. The
tolls chargeable will still be set by the
Board of Transport Commissioners, and not
by the Canadian National Railways.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill T-6, an Act to amend
the Supreme Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
provides for a purely administrative amendment, designed to facilitate the conduct of
business in the Supreme Court.
In the past few years the February session
of the Court bas been found to be not long
enough for the disposal of the appeals on
the list; therefore, it is considered advisable
to advance the opening day of the first session in each year from the first Tuesday in
February to the fourth Tuesday in January.
By this means the working period of the
first session in each year will be enlarged,
and the conduct of business will thereby be
facilitated.
I am advised that this change bas the
approval and active support of the Chief
Justice and of the members of the Court
and the officials connected with it. I belïeve
the change is advisable because of the

MAY G, 1952
increased volume of work now coming before
the court, and I commend the measure to
your favourable consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If there is no demand
that this measure be referred to committee,
I would ask that it be given third reading
at the next sitting of the house.
INTERPRETATION BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Donald MacLennan moved the second
reading of Bill U-6, an Act to amend the
Interpretation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, many provisions in the statutes require that reports and
other documents be laid before parliament.
Provisions of this nature, which are usually
found in departmental statutes, follow a
fairly uniform pattern, but they were evidently prepared originally on the assumption
that there would be only one session of parliament each year. Because of the two sessions
of parliament in each of the past few years
difficulties have arisen in the interpretation
of these provisions.
For example, section 16 of the Government Annuities Act is as follows:
There shall be laid before both bouses of parliament, within the first thirty days of each session
thereof, a return containing a full and clear statement and accounts of all business done in pursuance

of this Act during the fiscal year next previous to
such session.
A return to the end of the fiscal year would
probably not be ready until some months after
the 31st of March. If the report is completed
in August, and there is a full session in
September, it would be laid before both bouses
of parliament at that session. If another session of parliament were to begin in January
of the following year there would be no new
report to file at that session, because the fiscal
year would not end until March 31, and the
report would not be ready until the summer.
The section, however, requires that a return
be laid before both houses of parliament
within the first thirty days of each session.
There is a similar provision in the Department of Trade and Commerce Act, section 7.
This amendment simply means that if the
reports or other documents required to be
laid before parliament are submitted at one
session in each year, that will be sufficient.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? He says that the
Acts are now drawn on the assumption that

there will be only one session each year, and
that the Interpretation Act is to be amended
accordingly. Is it, then, a fair assumption
that hereafter there will be two sessions each
year? Does it mean that we are to have
another session this year?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I am sorry, but if
my honourable friend wants an answer be
will have to speak a little louder, I did not
fully understand his question. The proposed
amendment will not do away with the requirement to submit material to both houses of
parliament. As I said, it simply means that
when one report or document or ordinance of
any kind has been submitted to both houses
of parliament at one session, the same report
need not be laid before the houses at a second
session.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I would suggest
Thursday. I do not suppose it will be necessary to refer this amendment to a committee.
However, if it is the wish of the bouse that
it be so dealt with, I will move accordingly.
Some Hon. Senators: No; next sitting.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: With leave, I move
that the bill be read the third time at the next
sitting.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Vincent Dupuis moved the second
reading of Bill V-6, an Act to incorporate the
Great Eastern Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
similar to a large number of other measures
which have been presented before this bouse,
both last session and this session. The promoter of the bill is Mr. Gerald MacIsaac, of St.
Lambert, a well known insurance broker
who bas had long experience in this type of
business; Mr. Harold McLaughlin, secretarytreasurer, of Montreal, and Mr. Rene Labelle,
Q.C., of Montreal. Mr. Labelle is a member
of the firm of Labelle, Robert, Martel and
Provost, and is a son of Mr. Edouard Labelle,
a very distinguished Montreal lawyer and
businessman who is President of Canadian
Vickers Company.
The purpose of the bill is to enable this
company to write a great many types of
insurance contracts, some twenty-six in all,
including contracts of fire, accident and aircraft insurance. The capital of the company

SENATE

shall be one million dollars, divided into
ten thousand shares of one hundred dollars
each. The company shall not commence
business until at least $250,000 of its capital
has been subscribed and at least $100,000
thereon has been paid.
Al the other sections are in accordance
wi.th the Companies Act, and are those
ordinarily inserted in a bill of this kind.
I have only to add that the bill is in accordance with the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I inquire whether
it has the approval of our Department of
Insurance?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I am glad the honourable
member called my attention to this point. It
was suggested, I understand, that there was
some ambiguity about the bill in that the
name might cause confusion with the titles of
some other insurance companies. The promoters communicated with the Superintendent of Insurance on this and other points.
They also wrote to the Great Western Life
Insurance Company, who replied that they
had no objection, as the company to be incorporated will not be engaged in the same type
of insurance business as theirs. The Superintendent of Insurance has permitted the use
of the name, the Great Eastern Insurance
Company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And has he approved
the text of the bill
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: He has.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if subsection (1)
of section 6 is something new in insurance?
It deals with falling aircraft insurance.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: This is not new. Almost
all insurance companies of this kind issue
that type of insurance. It is now permitted,
and the insurance companies generally take
the risk.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Dupuis moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
VICTORIA DAY BILL

SECOND READING
Hon. J. H. King moved the second reading
of Bill 2, an Act to amend the Victoria Day
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the honourable leader (Hon. Mr Robertson) has asked

me to move the second reading of this measure. This bill comes from the House of
Commons, where it was introduced by a private member and was unanimously accepted
in its present form after running the gauntlet, a process that all such bills are subject
to in that chamber. The bill proposes to
amend the Victoria Day Act, so that Victoria
Day, instead of being celebrated on May 24
would
be governed by the following
provision:
Throughout Canada, in each and every year, the
first Monday immediately preceding the twentyfifth day of May shall be a legal holiday and shall
be kept and observed as such under the name of
Victoria Day.

If this amendment is agreed to, it will not

go into force until January, 1953.
What I have just read clearly indicates the
purpose of the bill. Victoria Day is the oldest declared holiday in Canada. Many years
ago, as honourable senators can recall, the
people of the countryside regarded the
Queen's birthday as the one holiday of the
year which was almost equal to Christmas.
In those horse and buggy days a holiday was
confined largely to the village or countryside, and celebrations were carried on
within each district. Things have changed
much in the last fifty odd years, and the
development of rapid transportation has
altered the whole holiday picture. We know
from experience how gratifying it is to our
people that Labour Day is celebrated on a
week end. It is proposed under this measure
that Victoria Day be celebrated on the first
Monday preceding the twenty-fifth day of
May, so that it will come on a week end.
I may say that this proposal has received
considerable publicity and has been well
received throughout Canada. The idea has
been favourably commented on by the
Victoria Colonist, the Vancouver Province, the
Vancouver News-Herald, the Financial Post,
the Montreal Gazette and the Montreal
Herald. It has also been well received by
such public bodies throughout Canada as the
Edmonton
Chamber of Commerce, the
Toronto Board of Trade, the Brantford Board
of Trade, the Commercial Travellers of
Canada, and the Halifax Board of Trade.
Needless to say the labour organizations
throughout the country are unanimously in
favour of it.
I do not think I need stress the importance
of this legislation, which will affect every
man, woman and child in Canada. Undoubtedly it would be to the advantage of our
people to have a week-end holiday instead of
a single day in the middle of the week, and
therefore I have much pleasure in moving
the second reading of this bill.

MAY 6. 1952
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, it was only a few years ago that somebody introduced a bill in this house which
tried to monkey with Dominion Day. Now
we seem to be trying to submerge the 24th
of May. I take it that if the 24th of May
came on a Saturday Victoria Day would be
celebrated on the previous Monday. This
would completely divorce this holiday from
the day that some of us are still young enough
to remember as one of great significance in
the life of Canadian people. For my part I
do not propose to support this measure.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
the thing that bothers me is that this is the
first attempt to change a holiday by statute,
and I am not in favour of this policy. If
you can change Victoria Day, there is no
reason why you cannot change Christmas
or Thanksgiving or the holiday that now
comes on the lst of July. As I recall it,
when this bill was introduced in the other
place it proposed to change the date of both
Victoria Day and Dominion Day.
Hon. Mr. King: We are dealing with the
bill that is now before us.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but that is a signal
of what might happen. To most of us in
this chamber Victoria Day means something.
To my children and my grandchildren it
has no meaning at all. To them it is just
a holiday. I can quite understand that.
Elizabeth II is going to celebrate her birthday in June, the month in which the late
King George VI celebrated his, and we have
I
become accustomed to that procedure.
think the majority of Canadians would enjoy
a holiday on a Monday rather than on a
Wednesday or Thursday. I can understand
that too. In these days of rapid transportation people can easily travel eightly or a
hundred miles to their summer homes to
enjoy a good weekend, especially when it
is a long one. But the nation has always
celebrated the Queen's birthday on the 24th
of May.
The other day somebody referred to the
old rhyme:
The Twenty-fourth of May is the Queen's birthday,

If you don't give us a holiday we'll all run away.
That was the first rhyme I learned as a schoolboy, and it meant a lot to all of us in my
generation. We learned it when we were
about five or six or seven, and as we got
older, say around fifteen or sixteen, and
started to study history, the rhyme came to
have a greater significance for us. It paid
tribute to a woman whose empire maintained
peace in the world for nearly sixty years.
Maybe she was not responsible for that-I
do not know-but, at any rate, that is the

idea we got from reading history. We saw
that she was the first great woman ruler
of our times.
I was brought up as a Conservative, and
I always have to be careful lest my Conservative principles may run away with my
judgment. Maybe it is because I am so conservative that I do not favour changing the
date of Victoria Day; but, honestly, I do not
like the suggested change at all. It seems
to me that if we are going to honour the
great reign of Queen Victoria we should do
so, as we have done in the past, on the date
of her birth. Suppose the bill is passed and
we celebrate, say, the 19th of May we might
have difflculty in explaining to our grandchildren-and some of us have grandchildren
-why we are celebrating that day.
Hon. Mr. King: As Victoria's birthday.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But that was not her birthday. They know it was on the 24th of May,
and they will correct us.
Of course, the legislation is not important
at all. If you want my honest opinion, I
really think it is nonsensical to take up the
time of parliament in considering legislation
of this kind when we have so many other
urgent problems to deal with. The only
reason the proposal stirs up any interest is
that the dates of important historical happenings stick in our minds, and if we are to
commemorate those happenings we would like
to do so on the correct dates.
I do not intend to call for a division on the
bill, but if there is a division I shall vote
against the measure.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
hope sincerely that the few words I am going
to say will not sound a discordant note in
this little debate. I have just been wondering
why we should have this holiday at all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I can remember very well
that in my boyhood the Queen's birthday was
celebrated, and we liked the holiday. But
I leave it to anyone in the chamber to say
whether Victoria Day now means anything
more than another holiday. In my opinion
it does not commemorate anything. The
late Queen Victoria was born more than one
hundred years ago, and most of her reign was
marked by peace-in which respect it was
no different from that of some other of our
sovereigns whose birthdays we do not intend
to commemorate for all time. My point is
simply this: I feel that the 24th of May really
means nothing more to most of us than just
another holiday. If that be true-I hesitate
to suggest this-why should we not discontinue it altogether?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Farris: That would not be popular.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It might not be popular,
but it would be practical. I apologize for
making the suggestion, if an apology is necessary, but I should not be surprised to learn
that a good many people in this country have
had the same thought. We here cannot
abolish the holiday at this time, but we might
raise a doubt in the minds of the public as
to whether we should continue to celebrate
the birthday of Queen Victoria while ignoring
the birthdays of the many sovereigns who
succeeded her.
Here is another thought. We are going
to have three holidays very close together,
and the abolition of one of them might be
in order. We shall have the 24th of May;
and, with all due respect to my very good
friend from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)
you cannot say that the 24th of May is any
other date than just that. For my part,
I am not in favour of the suggestion to
celebrate Victoria Day on another date. If
we are going to continue the holiday, I should
prefer to have it on the 24th of May, which
was Queen Victoria's birthday. Then, we
are going to have a holiday to celebrate the
birth of our present Queen. With that I
have no fault to find; I think it is a good thing
to celebrate the birthday of the reigning
sovereign. Then we shall be celebrating the
lst of July, which is quite a proper holiday
for us in Canada.
I apologize again for throwing into the
discussion a suggestion that may meet with
the disapproval of a good many people, but I
have expressed my own feeling.

could dispense with the 24th of May as a
holiday. I rise to support that suggestion
warmly. But if we are not to dispense with
it, certainly it will lose all significance-if
any significance still attaches to it-if the
date of the holiday is shifted from the 24th
of May to the 19th or any other date. But
bas not the celebration of the 24th of May
ceased to have any significance with the
great majority of the Canadian people? I
believe that to most Canadians it has come to
be just another holiday.
Most of our holidays have some significance, and it is rather interesting to note the
number of statutory holidays that we now
celebrate. I should like to enumerate them.
We have Good Friday. No one will question
that.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why not have that on
Monday?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: You overlooked New
Year's Day.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We have now the present
Queen's Birthday, which is to be celebrated,
I believe, on the 9th of June.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why not have that on
a Monday too?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Of course. And why not
have Christmas Day on a Monday, and Dominion Day? There is just as sound an argument for always having each of these holidays on a Monday as there is for always
having Victoria Day on a Monday.
But let me continue with the list of statutory holidays. We have Victoria Day, and
shall have it as long as the present legislaHon. A. C. Hardy: Honourable senators, tion remains in force. Then we have the

over the country.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
my friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
has no occasion to apologize for his suggestion that the time bas been reached when we

An Hon. Senator: Let's make every day a
holiday.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Are we not approaching
the stage where we will have as many holidays

MAY 6, 1952
as work days? I think the time has come
when we should look realistically at the question of holidays.
When the 24th of May was first set aside
as a holiday it had some significance. It
commemorated the birthday of one who during her lifetime was regarded as a great
sovereign, but who has been dead almost
fifty years.
By the way, I should have asked the sponsor of the bill whether May 24 is celebrated
as a holiday in Great Britain. My honourable
friend indicates that it is not. Then I say,
are we to be more loyal to the memory of
Queen Victoria than are the people of the
British Isles among whom she lived? Is Victoria Day celebrated in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the other countries of
the Commonwealth? I do not think it is.
I would support the very sensible suggestion made by my desk-mate (Hon. Mr. Euler),
who usually makes sensible suggestions.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think that instead of
passing a bill for the celebration of 24th of
May on a Monday, we should repeal the
Victoria Day Act altogether.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
in my opinion this important matter requires
careful consideration. I agree in part with
what the senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) and the senator from Churchill Hon.
Mr. Crerar) have said, but I am one of those
who are in favour of Monday holidays, so
that I can go fishing over the long week-end.
That is important to me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Still young.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Nevertheless, I am
willing to give up my fishing for one week-end
rather than have the birthday of Queen Victoria changed.
To me, like the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), the 24th of May
has always been a great day. I recall that
in my boyhood days in Ontario the young
people would celebrate this day by singing
patriotic songs, Rule Britannia and others.
If we are goin-g to keep the 24th of May
as a holiday it should be celebrated on that
date. On the other hand-, if it is decided that
we should do away with the practice of having
a holiday on that date, I will not object.
My suggestion is that we celebrate the
holiday on the 24th of May.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Ionourable senators,
until this moment I had' not intended to speak,
but I feel that I should say a few words on
behalf of this measure sponsored by my
friend the senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King).

First, I can scarcely understand the -argument of my friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig), when, he says that parliament has no
authority to deal with this billHon. Mr. Haig: Pardon me. I did not say
that. Parliament has a legal right to make
the proposed change, but I do not think it
should exercise that right.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That is the point. We
did exercise the right in 1927, because this bill
proposes an amendment to legislation passed
in that year, called the Victoria Day Act.
I am one who believes profoundly that we
should continue to celebrate the reign of
Queen Victoria, for she meant much to
Canada. I need not tell honourable senators
that it was during her reign that our parliamentary system was born, and we were
started on our way towards the position we
now hold in the British Commonwealth and in
the world at large. I do not think that we
celebrate the 24th of May merely because it is
the day upon which a late sovereign happened
to be born, but I believe that the passage of
this amendment would add to our reverence
and respect for Queen Victoria and what she
meant to Canada.
I rise to support the motion of the honourable senator from Kootenay East for second
reading of this bill.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, the
bill contains no provision for the abolition of
Victoria Day as a holiday, and to discuss that
question seems to me to be beside the point.
For my part, I am opposed to the suggestion that Victoria Day should be rolled up
with some other holidays, thereby detracting
from its importance. We are fast approaching the time when most industries will regard
Saturday as a holiday; and Sunday is, cf
course, a holy day. If these two days are
followed by a Monday holiday, it means
that for three days there is no mail service
in this country, because the postal employees
want holidays too. The sports fishermen will
stay home over Sunday if they do not get a
Monday holiday. It means also that the
mothers, for instance, will have their schoolage children on their hands for a longer weekend than usual. When Sunday is followed
by a public holiday everybody is in holiday
mood, and the Sabbath is not observed with
the reverence it deserves.
True, the reign of the late Queen Victoria
was the longest and most glorious in British
history. For that reason Victoria Day has
always been recognized. The 24th of May
comes at a time of year when the people
of this country have their first opportunity to
get out into the open, and they look forward
to it as a special day. In my opinion the

SENATE
rolling up of these holidays in a long weekend would be a mistake. For economic
and many other reasons, and I am in favour
of Victoria Day being celebrated on the 24th
of May.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
I share the views of some of my friends who
have spoken against this measure. We cannot properly say that the 24th of May can
be changed to the 19th or the 20th of May.
For one hundred and fifteen years we have
celebrated the birthday of Queen Victoria
on the 24th of May. What is the object of
coming here after all that time and asking
us to change the date to any other day of
the month, be it the 19th, 20th, or any other
time, merely to satisfy a lot of people who
are opposed to working?
The trouble today is that we are not
working hard enough. There are too many
holidays. I think we should give more consideration to encouraging people to go to
work rather than providing them with more
holidays. I shahl vote against this bill.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: I had not intended
to talk about this bill. However, I called to
mind that when I was in college we had,
apart from the summer vacation, only three
days' holidays a year, and certainly we did
not find that that was enough. When my
father was at college he had one day's holiday in the whole course of the year, and he,
too, certainly did not think it sufficient.
Today our children have fifteen days' recess
at Christmas and four or five days at Easter,
and in my opinion they will go out into the
working world just as well prepared as we
were.
We should not think of ourselves alone.
Thousands and thousands of people in Canada
are glad to have a holiday. If Victoria Day
signifies anything, it means a lot to me; but
for the mass of the people of Canada it is
immaterial whether that day is celebrated on
the 24th or the 19th or the 21st. What
matters is that they get a holiday, and if the
most suitable day for working people is a
Monday, why not give it to them? We who
are members of this house can take a vacation any Monday we like, but let us have
regard to the great numbers of people who
work from day to day for a salary and are
not free to take a holiday any Monday they
choose. There are a few opportunities in
the course of the year for them to enjoy two
or three consecutive days of leisure. Why
should not Victoria Day be one of them?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: What about the farmer
and the fishermen?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The farmer or the
fisherman can take his holiday whenever he

likes. As a matter of fact I do not know of
a single farmer who celebrates either Victoria Day or Labour Day as a holiday. So
I repeat, why should not those who want to
take a holiday have the opportunity of taking it on a Monday and, if they want to, go
fishing over the week end?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why not have a holiday
every Monday?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Well, at the present
time the preference seems to be for Saturday. The working class is demanding a fiveday week. I am opposed to this, but I
believe we shall be doing wrong if we deny
the people of Canada the opportunity of a
Monday holiday when there is the chance to
give it to them. As I have said, if I want
to take a Monday off I can do so, but the
working class have not this privilege. So,
if on a few occasions in the year we can
accommodate these people, let us do so.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask my honourable
friend whether he does not think in these
circumstances it would be better to change
the name from Victoria Day to Fishing Day?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It might be a good idea.
On the other hand, I think Victoria Day still
means something. Victoria Day was established to honour a great queen. In celebrating it I still feel that it bas this significance.
If we want to maintain the memory of Queen
Victoria in the minds of the Canadian people
let us retain Victoria Day, and whether it
falls on the 21st or the 22nd or the 24th, it
will still be Victoria Day.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: I have very little
to say about this bill, but I have been very
much amused at the debate. I listened to
one senator after another, men who have
passed the meridian of life-I will not say
they have grown old, but they are not very
young-whose memories of the lovely times
they spent in the old days on the 24th of
May are still fresh in their minds. "Fond
memory brings the light of other days"
around us.
The sponsor of the bill said that it was
popular throughout the country; and I think
he is right. On the other hand there are
many who, like honourable senators who
have spoken-with the exception of the last
speaker and the sponsor-have "fond memories" of Victoria Day and of the queen whom
it was established to commemorate. This
difference of opinion illustrates how these
things hang on for a while and, as one generation succeeds another, the younger people
have neither the same memories nor the
same prejudices as their predecessors.

MAY 6. 1952
We have progressed, perhaps, far enougb
beyond the Victorian era and those who
loved that era ta give a proposition like this
a purely utilitarian and objective consideratian. I think the 24th of May, or the Queen's
birthday, as we cail it, had a utilitarian
aspect. It is a fine time of the year for a
holiday. Ail over Canada the crocuses are
out; in most parts, certainly in Ontario, the
wild fiowers are in the woods, the grass is
nice and green, and we are ail glad to, get rid
of the snow, and the boys and girls want
ta go out and play in the open. I remember
that, when I was young enough, it was a day
on which we shed our red woolen underwear. Same of us would also take off aur
boots and sboes without any great objection on the part of our parents; and if we
were hardy enough, we dived into the old
swimming pool. It is the time of year when
you want a holiday. Samebody said that it
is now just another holiday. That is true,
but aiso it is very well-timed, and I amrn ot
one of those wha believe we have too many
holidays. I think they are good things and
that they help ta develop the health and
growth of aur youth.
As for working,
surely we work long enough; and the school
children too, because the object of education is flot ta cram young people with a lot
of book learning but rather ta deveiop them,
and if they are to graw and expand their
pawers, halidays are essential.
You and I who remember the aid Queen's
Birthday as such wiil flot be bere very much
longer. A younger generation will corne
along, those who "1knew flot Joseph", and
who wiil look on this as just a spring holiday.
We might as weil get out of the way and
let the march af progress go on. It is a
good change, because it is justified by
utility. Of course, some of the sentiment
remains.
I received a protest from one
organization which does noît like the change.
That is a natural attitude among oid
people, but the f a-et is that utilitarian considerati-ons mnust be supreme. We may reject
this proposai, but before long we shail pass
away, and oithers who do flot share aur
memories wiil corne along and, make the
change. We can delay it for a while but we
cannot delay it long. I -arn in favour of giving
the people the holiday they desire, on a Monday. This is more -canvenient than the haphazard way li which it flow f ails, on the 24th.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I must confess that when this debate started
I was of two minds as ta how I should vote
on the second reading of this bill, but the
course of the debate has brought two ideas
ta my mind which I should like ta stress.
One- tbing that struck me about the bill
in the form in which it came before us was

that it did flot have on the opposite page, as
it should have had, the provision o! the present
statute which it proposes to replace.
Hon. Mr. King: It is a private member's bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I looked up the present
statute, which is chapter 204 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, entitled an Act respecting
Victoria Day. I was a good deal impressed
for some time by the arguments o! honourable
senators who said that the birthday of the
good Queen Victoria was the 24th of May,
and that na change should be made from that
date. As I say, I was impressed with that
argument until I read the present statute,
whicb reads:
Throughout Canada, li each and every year, the
twenty-fourth day of May, being the birthday of
Her late Mai esty Queen Victoria, shall, when flot a
Sunday, be a legal holiday and shall le kept and
observed as such under the name of Victoria Day.

The next section:
Whexi the twenty-fourth day of May Is a Sunday,
the twenty-fifth day of May shall be, in lieu
thereof, a legal holiday throughout Canada, and
shail be kept and observed as such under the same
namne.
I suggest to, my honourable friends that if,
since confederation, we have kept the 25th
of May as Victoria Day whenever the 24th
o! May has happened ta, fail on a Sunday,
there is no particular reason why we should
flot keep the 19th or the 21st or 22nd of May
as Victoria Day.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Ta not such a provision found
in every statute which provides for a public
holiday?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have no idea; but it
daes flot affect my argument li any way.
Thase who tell us that we have got to celebrate Victoria Day an the 24th of May are
faced with the fact that every few years we
celebrate it on the 25th of May.
Honourable senators, I think the memory of
the great Queen Victoria deserves a place in
the history of this country, and that a day
should be set aside to celebrate ber memory.
I suggest ta my honourable friends, bowever,
that over the course of years what bas happened bas been this. We no longer commonly
speak of "Victoria Day". We talk about the
24th of May as a holiday. If this bill is
passed, Queen Victoria's birtbday wili not
necessarily be ceiebrated on the 24th of May
but on a day witbin a certain number of days
of this date which will be known as Victoria
Day. I suggest that that wiil be a much better
way of commemorating the reign of the great
Queen tban by merely celebrating it on a
fixed day which bas become known as "the
24th of May".
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, bear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I simply advance these
suggestions as thoughts which came into my
mind during the course of the debate, and
as reasons why I intend to vote for the second
reading of this bill.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
it seems that most of those who have taken
part in this debate would have no great
objection to completely discontinuing the
celebration of Victoria Day; but that is not
the question before the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are correct.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The question before
the house is whether Victoria Day should be
celebrated on a Monday if the 24th of May
should not fall on that day.
The amendment now under discussion was
unanimously adopted by the other house, and
the honourable senator for Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) has enumerated a great many
publications and public bodies which have
favoured the bill. I venture to say that the
vast majority of Canadians today celebrate
the 24th of May just as a holiday, and I
think that the celebration of this holiday on
a Monday would be greatly appreciated by
everybody.
As one honourable senator
pointed out, May is a time of year to enjoy
the beauties of nature.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Do the farmers get out to
celebrate a Monday holiday? I do not see
them.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: You don't see them.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I maintain that with
present farm machinery our farmers can
enjoy many holidays. With their up-to-date
equipment they can work under headlights
at night and take a holiday the next day if
they wish.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: What about milking cows
three times a day?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They do not milk cows
any more since my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) introduced his
Margarine Bill.
Some Hon. Senator: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I intend to support this
bill.
Hon. Calveri C. Pratt: Honourable senators, it has become obvious to me while
listening to this debate that the 24th of May
has far greater significance in the Province
of Newfoundland than it has in other provinces represented by various senators who
have spoken. I know of course that the 24th
of May was Queen Victoria's birthday, but
in Newfoundland it is never referred to as
Victoria Day. It is celebrated as Queen

Victoria's birthday, although it has been
referred to as Empire Day, and latterly as
Commonwealth Day. Public functions are
held on that day, and it is a day of celebration of Empire and Commonwealth. It has
its roots, of course, in the fact that it was
Queen Victoria's birthday and the fact that
a great empire was developed during her
reign. I think it would be a great mistake
if that day were simply to become another
holiday.
Holidays are falling into the category of
very sacred institutions; they are losing their
original significance and they are becoming
sacred because of the mere fact that they are
holidays. I feel that we are laying too much
stress on holidays.
But that is not the point of the debate. The
point is whether we are to change the date
of an honoured day, Victoria's birthd;ay, which
in one province at least is adopted as Empire
Day and Commonwealth Day. I personally
think that we should retain the 24th of May as
the date of celebration of Victoria's birthday,
as provided for in the Act that has been read
here, and observe it as a day with its full
original meaning.
Otherwise, let it be
dropped.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Sone Hon. Senalors: Question.
Hon. Mr. King: Honourable senators, I shall
take just a moment. The discussion has been
most interesting. I was rather surprised that
my friend the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) should take the position that it
would be reprehensible to provide for celebration of Queen Victoria's birthday on any
other date than the 24th of May. The late
King, seeking to serve the convenience
of his peoples, did not hesitate to change
by decree the date of observance of his own
birthday from a day in December to a day
in June.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is different.
Hon. Mr. King: It seems to me that my
honourable friend's argument has not any
great force. Those who support the bill have
no intention of doing any injustice to the
memory of the great Queen. It is well understood in Canada that the 24th of May is one
of the delightful days in the break into summer. I remember that when I was a boy
Victoria Day was the day when we were
instructed to rake up the school yards. And
today home owners all across the country are
glad of the opportunity it affords them to
clean up their gardens. The celebrating of
the occasion on Monday would enable the
people to enjoy a three day week-end at the
beginning of summer, just as Labour Day
gives them a three day week-end at the end
of summer.

MAY 8, 1952
I do not think that there is any sound reason
for fearing that the celebration of Victoria
Day on the Monday preceding the 24th of
May would bring about any lessening of
the day's significance. It would become the
practice to signalize the occasion on that
Monday. As I remarked to this body, the
horse and buggy days have passed, and we
cannot think in terms of those days now.
Because of rapid means of transportation
large numbers of people are accustomed to
enjoy holidays by going on picnics and
friendly visits many miles from home, and
certainly Victoria Day would be more convenient for these purposes if it always fell
on a Monday. I cannot see why the sentimental idea should have been brought into the
discussion; for no one in parliament, I feel
sure, would do anything to detract from the
honour that has always been accorded the late
Queen Victoria, who was a great sovereign.
After the bill has been given second
reading, if it is desired to have it considered
in committee I shall move that it be referred
to the Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills, where the sponsors of the measure
would come to discuss it with honourable
senators.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is now on the motion for second
reading of this bill. Is it your pleasure to
carry the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Some Hon. Senators: No.
The Hon. the Speaker: In my opinion, the
motion is carried.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I am
sorry to interrupt, but what is the position?
We down in this part of the chamber are
unaware of what has happened. Was the
motion carried or not carried?
The Hon. the Speaker: I declared the
motion for second reading carried.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, if
there are four who will support me, let us
stand up and call for a division.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Why didn't you stand
when the motion was called?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) did not hear
what was said. I will stand for a division.
Hon. Mr. King: The motion has been
declared carried.
The Hon. the Speaker: If honourable senators wish a division, it may be had on the
motion for third reading.

Hon. Mr. King: I have no objection to a
division now, but there will be an opportunity for a vote on the motion for third
reading.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The advantage in having a
vote now is that all of us here have heard
the discussion.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think the objection
was raised too late.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. King: Next sitting.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
MONDAY SITTINGS

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I should like to notify the house that I intend,
unless something unforeseen happens, to
move on Thursday that we adjourn until
Monday night; and, until further notice, to
ask the house to reassemble after every weekend recess on Monday night instead of Tuesday night as we have been doing so far this
session.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Suppose Monday comes
on the 24th!
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think that no reasonable argument can be raised against our
reassembling on Monday evening, for it cannot be suggested that up to date we have
been overworked on Mondays. I wish to
point out that, though I may not have very
much business to bring before the house itself,
there is a great deal of committee work to
be taken care of. A large number of divorce
cases are still to be heard. And I hope to
have for introduction on Thursday a bill
to amend the Criminal Code. If so, I should
like to have it given second reading early
next week and sent to an appropriate committee, where it will require considerable
attention.
Members of the Committee on Finance will
know that if we were to adjourn every
Thursday until the following Tuesday evening it would simply be impossible to carry
through the program outlined by that committee. My purpose in asking the Senate
to resume on Monday evenings is to facilitate the work of committees by having senators available for this work early in the
week. And because of the relatively light
volume of legislation that the Senate itself
may expect to have before it in the near

SENATE
future, it may be possible to go on with
committee work some afternoons after the
Senate rises. I express that view just as a
matter of opinion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, the
steering committee of the Committee on
Finance agreed to meet at 10.30 on Thursday
morning. It wishes to submit its program to
the whole committee; and I think that program will prove to be a very interesting one,
especially if we can secure the attendance
of persons whom we are proposing to invite.
On behalf of the chairman of the committee
I would bespeak a full attendance at Thursday morning's meeting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has told us
of his intention to introduce soon the bill
to amend the Criminal Code. I understand
that this bill contains a complete revision
of the Code, and I should like to know if it
is ready for distribution now. It would be
helpful if we had a chance to study such a
lengthy measure before it is introduced.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am speaking now
subject to correction, but I think that when
the report of the commissioners was brought
down and tabled a certain number of copies
of the bill recommended by them were made
available. Certain changes will have to be
incorporated in the measure now being
printed, and I do not think it will be available until early next week. I assure honourable senators that I will not proceed with
consideration of the bill until copies are
available. I may say that while there are
many substantial changes, the principal purpose of the measure is the consolidation of
some seven or eight hundred sections which
remain exactly as they were.
In answer to the specific question as to
whether copies will be available on Thursday, when I hope to introduce the bill, I
must say I doubt very much that they will
be on hand before next week.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

VICTORIA DAY

BILL

THIRD READING

what may be termed hasty legisiation or
legisiation to which the other chamber has
not given the consideration which it deserves.
The bill now before us seeks to correct an
outstanding example of such legisiation.
,In the final days of the first session of
last year a government bil was introduced
into the Commons, where it carried with
practically no debate whatsoever. Many of
the members of that house were absent in
anticipation of early prorogation. This 'bill,
known as the Canada Dairy Products Bull,
then came to this chamber, where it was
also passed. As was the case in the other
house, many of the mem-bers of the Senate
were absent. But we did have a most interesting debate about certain parts of the bull
bef ore it was carried by a small mai ority.
Ostensibly the bull was intended to deal
with the regulating and grading of dairy
products and substîtutes thereof. To that
no one could make any serious objection. But
clause 6 of the bill contained one paragraph
that was decidedly objectionable. In fact, it
was criticized by some of us here as extremely
obnoxious and even unconstitutional. Certainly it was in direct confiict with the letter
and spirit of the British North America Act,
and to my mind it was clearly subversive of
one of the basic principles of confederation,
namely, the freedom of trade between the
provinces.
That clause 6 contained three paragraphs,
(a), (b) and (c).
Paragraphs (a) and (b)
empowered the Governor in Council to prohibit the importation into Canada and the
exportation out of Canada of dairy products.
Though I was not; particularly enthusiastic
about those two paragraphs, I am not dealing
with them in this bill. What the bull is
concerned with is paragraph (c), which
authorized the Governor in Council to make
regulations prohibiting the carrying of dairy
products and their substitutes from one province to any other. I will read that paragraph,
for I think it should go into the record once
more:
The Governor In Council may by regulation

on this motion for third reading, because
he said last night that if a. division were
called he would vote against this measure.
I am not going to speak further; but if
five members rise, I will ask that a vote be
taken on this bill.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, yes. Well, I will say
"unfortunately".
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is better.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I will say "fortunately or
unfortunately".
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You cannot have it
both ways.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In my humble opinion, the
part of last year's bill that I have just read
is in direct conflict with section 121 of the
British North America Act, which Act is
our constitution. That section says:
All articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from and
after the Union, be admitted free into each of the
other provinces.

To a layman like me those words mean
what they say. It seems to me tnat their meaning is entirely unmistakable; and if I am
correct in this they certainly forbid the government of Canada from prohibiting the
carrying of any products of any one province
products or any others-into any
-dairy
other province. It may be argued here today,
as I know it has been argued before, that
this section 121, which seems so clear to me,
has been interpreted even by a court as meaning that no province bas the power to erect
a customs tariff against the products of any
other province. But surely if that was the
intention of the framers of the British North
America Act, it would have been stated in
plain language. In any case, even if the
correct interpretation were that one province
could not erect a tariff wall against the
products of another province, the indication
is that there was no intention that the prohibition should be entirely exclusive. A tariff
wall, if it is not too high, does not prevent
some trading between provinces, but a prohibition may altogether destroy trade between
provinces.
I do not propose to argue the constitutional
side of this question; I shall leave that phase
of the debate to my many colleagues who are
well versed in the law. My reail argument
is that even if this narrow interpretation is
constitutional, the exercise of such a power
of prohibition is absolutely bad and vicious.
Further, if it is carried to its logical extension and conclusion it will make a mockery
of the federation principle, which is freedom
of trade between the provinces. If this law
is sound in principle and in practice, and, the
precedent is established that one province
can shut out the products of another, then
why could that prohibition not be made to
apply to all commodities? For instance, the
lumber, fruit and fish of British Columbia
might well be prohibited from going into
other provinces in competition with their own
products, or coal from Alberta might be

prevented from coming into Ontario. Such a
prohibition might also be applied to the shipment of feed grain from the Prairie Provinces
to Ontario, where it is so badly needed.
Under such an interpretation the fish from
the Maritimes and the factory products of
Quebec and Ontario might well be prevented
from going into other provinces.
Once this vicious practice is established we
would have virtually ten independent provinces within the Dominion of Canada, and we
would be on a fair way to the establishment
of what I think the senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) last session
described as a "balkanization" -of this country.
It would defeat the chief purposes of
confederation.
One may argue, and it has been said to me,
that no government would do such things as
I have mentioned. Probably that is true. But
why leave on the statute books a law which
permits a government to do a thing that is
so obviously wrong? Perhaps it is significant-I hope it is-that although this law
was passed almost a year ago it bas not yet
been implemented by order-in-council.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They are afraid.
Hon. Mr. Euler: One may hope that the
government has sensed the fact that a mistake
has been made, and has no intention of
implementing the authority. If that is so,
I hope the present measure will be permitted
to pass, and that the objectionable clause will
be deleted from the Act.
I am satisfied that no such law prohibiting
trade exists in any federation similar to our
own. I doubt that it exists, for instance, in
Australia or that great federation, the U.S.
Indeed, one of the foundation stones of confederation is freedom of trade between
provinces. I can understand the reason for
the erection of trade barriers between countries-although I do not always approve of
it-but an absolute prohibition of trade
between provinces is certainly subversive of
all that we have regarded as proper practice
within our federation.
We have to the south of us the great
United States, the oldest of the federations.
I am glad that most of the senators were
present last week at a gathering which was
addressed by that most eminent former jurist
of the Supreme Court of the United States,
the Honourable Mr. Roberts. He made a
speech that I wish he could make here today,
because he voiced exactly the arguments
which I wish to put forward. I had a talk
with him afterwards, and he repeated what
he had said at our meeting in the committee
room upstairs, that under the Constitution
of the United States-and I am not to be

MAY 7, 1952
understood as being a blind admirer of that
country-it would not be possible for the
federal government to prohibit the carrying
from one state to another of any kind of
commodity.
Then he declared that the
United States became the greatest industrial
country in the world because it was internally
a free trade area. The United States is frequently referred to as the greatest free trade
country in the world being composed of what
are practically forty-eight countries, each of
which can trade freely with any other.
If barriers are erected between provinces
-which is what this prohibitory clause gives
the government power to do--why cannot
the process be carried a step further, and
applied right down to our municipal and city
jurisdictions? It may be that a good many
merchants in the towns and cities would be
glad to see such great firms as the T. Eaton
Company and Simpson's prevented from
sending their goods to Kitchener, Waterloo,
Guelph, Ottawa, or elsewhere. In theory,
such a prohibition would be possible. We
might find city and town councils vying with
each other to prevent the selling of goods by
outsiders in their municipalities, and supposing that thereby they were doing a service
to their communities, though in fact such
restrictions woud cause serious loss of business and impair the prosperity of the country.
I have made some inquiries, and I know
that in the closing days of the session of a
year ago, when the bill was passed, many
members of the other chamber were busy
with other matters and did not realize the
implications of the measure. I also know,
that they are opposed to the principle
enunciated in section 6, subsection 1 (c),
and would welcome an opportunity to reconsider it.
The Senate now has an opportunity to discharge what I regard as one of its most
important functions,-the defence of the
fundamental principles of confederation. I
have introduced the present bill because I
believe this house has a very definite
responsibility. I hope the bill will be given
second reading, that it will be permitted to
pass, and that it will go to the House of
Commons, there to have the careful consideration which it deserves, and which the
principle involved has not yet received.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators,
the Dairy Products Act of 1951 was a masterpiece of restriction.
No sod was left
unturned, no word omitted that would restrict
the importation of certain products into
Canada, the export of similar products out
of Canada, their movement from one province to another- Then, in order to make the
55708-13J

meaning perfectly clear, it was restated in
section 6 in these tense words:
(3) No person shall
(a) import into Canada,
(b) export from Canada, or
(c) send or convey from one province to another,
a dairy product or other thing contrary to a regulation made under this section.

It took power not only over the dominion
but it clinched the whole field by restricting
movements within the provinces. These products included milk and related food products,
twenty-eight in all, winding up with malted
milk and sherbet.
One may freely admit that government
may enact laws to restrict or prohibit the
export of a product from the Dominion of
Canada, or-more likely-to restrict imports;
but I wonder if it has the power to prohibit
imports or exports from one province to
another-from Newfoundland to Nova Scotia,
Manitoba to British Columbia, Ontario to
Quebec. At least it may be said that it is
a rather strange attitude for a great dominion
to legislate for itself and then to set up barriers against exchange between provinces. But
if barriers can be erected between provinces
why not between countries? Many people, it
seems, object to a free world; but to restrict
trade between the provinces is going a long
way towards the denial of the very concepts
on which the dominion was founded.
What a lovely job that Canada Dairy Act
must have been for the lawyer who wrote
it! What a comprehensive mind he hadmilk, cream, butter, cheese, condensed milk,
evaporated milk, milk powder, dry milkprobably to the limit ice cream, malted milk
or sherbet that contains fat or oil. Then he
goes on to prohibit not only those products
but substitutes for them. Then comes the
climax. In section 6, subsection 3(c) we find
this:
No person shall send or convey from one province to another a dairy product or other thing
contrary to a regulation made under this section.

This is surely a bland pronouncement! I

like particularly the phrase "or other things
contrary to a regulation made under this
section." Here is the hope, well expressed,
that nothing should be left undone to make
assurance doubly sure. This is "prohibition"
new style, and when the lawyer who helped
create these restrictions read them over to
himself he must have added "Restrictions
are now complete, my work is finished'and rested on the Sabbath day!
Legislation of this kind balkanizes a nation.
We have too many restrictions. I am a Canadian: men and commodities should move
freely through the separate provinces which
constitute the dominion. I come from the

SENATE
province of Newfoundland and I am proud
of it. I love that old province, but I love
Canada too. Anything which injures my
province must injure the other provinces as
well. We are all part of one nation.
It is a simple matter to erect barriers. All
too often they are made by those who have
an axe or two to grind, and who too frequently get in their work before their real
objects are recognized. The guarded words
in which their purposes are expressed are
not clearly understood: they lead to
misunderstanding.
Let us never forget that Canada is one
nation.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I think I should say that this bill
seeks to amend legislation which I, in my
capacity of government leader, sponsored and
initiated, and which was passed during last
session. Before considering the question of
second reading, I should like to give thought
to what I would say in respect to the bill, and
therefore desire to adjourn the debate. There
is no particular reason why I should do so
at this moment, however, because there is not
much business on the Order Paper and other
senators may wish to proceed at this time.
I should like to reserve the right to speak
after those who may care to speak today.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
have listened with a great deal of pleasure to
the remarks of the sponsor of this bill (Hon.
Mr. Euler) and to those of the honourable
gentleman from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird).
I congratulate them on the clarity of their
submissions and on the objective manner in
which they have brought this matter to our
attention.
I am entirely in accord with the principle
of the bill before us. In my humble opinion the
legislation which it is proposed to amend
has always been categorically opposed to the
fundamental principle embodied in section
121 of the British North America Act, which
reads as follows:
All articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from and
after the Union, be admitted free into each of the
other provinces.

Thus, one of the fundamental bases of confederation was that there should be no barrier to prevent the free flow of commodities
from one province to the others. Mind you,
section 121 provides in the first place that
these articles shaH be admitted., and in the
second place that they shall be admitted free.
I should think, therefore, that this fundamental principle is a governing one which we
should always have in mind.

I am entirely of the opinion expressed by
Mr. Justice Roberts, and quoted by my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), that the United States would never
have reached -the present degree of prosperity, peace and happiness which exists as
between the various states of the Union had
they not had a similar principle in their own
constitution. As for Canada, I am sure that
the four original provinces, and those which
joined the union later, would never have come
into confederation had they entertained any
thought that any province or the Government
of Canada could at any time establish a
barrier or wall to prevent the free flow of
commodities from one province to the others.
I am pleased that the honourable gentleman
from St. John's adheres to that principle as a
cardinal principle of the Canadian Union.
This matter was brought to the attention
of the Supreme Court of Canada in 1949 and
it was heldthat the prohibition of importation of the goods
mentioned in the section is intra vires of parliament as legislation in relation to foreign trade.
Locke J.-

one of the Justices of the Supreme Courtfinds the whole section to be ultra vires while expressing no opinion as to the power of parliament
to ban importation by appropriate legislation, the
prohibition of importation being merely ancillary
to the other prohibitions.
Held, the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. dissenting,
that the prohibition of manufacture, offer, sale or
possession for sale of the goods mentioned is ultra
vires of parliament. It is legislation in relation to
property and civil rights which cannot be supported under any head of section 91. Nor can it
be supported as legislation for the peace, order and
good government of Canada.
Per the Chief Justice (dissenting): The Dairy
Industry Act is within the domain of the Dominion
as a law in relation to agriculture and this cannot
be discarded on the ground that the products here
in question are articles of trade or commodities
which are not directly the product of agriculture.
Therefore the insertion of section 5(a) being an
insertion in the Dairy Industry Act is nothing
more than the direct exercise of parliament's jurisdiction over agricultural matters or at least necessarily incidental and necessary for the effective
control of agricultural matters in respect of milk
and its by-products; and the mere contention that
they are not natural products but rather manufactured articles is not sufficient to remove them from
the domain of the federal government in respect
of agriculture.
The Chief Justice and Kerwin J (dissenting):
There is no ground on which it may be held that
the legislation here in question, on its true construction, is not what it professes to b, that is,
an enactment creating a criminal offence in exercise of the powers vested in parliament by head 27
of section 91.

I am altogether in accord with the principles that have been propounded by the
sponsor of this bill and by the honourable
gentleman from St. John's, and I intend to
vote for the measure.

MAY 7, 1952
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. C. Davis: Honourable senators, the
sponsor of this bill spoke about the constitution of the United States as outlined to
him by an ex-member of the Supreme Court
of that great country. He might very well,
however, have gone further back to discuss
the reasons and the manner in which the
United States of America gained the freedom
of trade between its various states. I would
draw attention to the fact that the United
States originated from thirteen of the old
British Colonies in North America. These
colonies, in a kind of loose confederacy,
fought and gained the so-called War of Independence, which was ended about 1781. Then
they began to carry on almost as separate
countries. Customs tariffs were imposed on
the movement of goods between one colony
and another, and indeed the colonies nearly
came to war between themselves over the
resulting restriction of trade.
But the great fact of having gained independence together was regarded by the
American statesmen as overriding all other
political considerations, and they convened
a new political body, the Constitutional Conference. Representatives of all the thirteen
insurgent states-not members of congress,
but independent representatives elected for
this definite purpose-were assembled in
camera for four or five months, drafting a

prescribed majority was obtained.
instrument was a compromise of the aspirations of the individual states, and among
other things it provided that the residuary
powers were to be left in the states themselves, with limited and expressed powers
given to the central government.
The institution of slavery, which made it
possible for one man to possess property in
another man's body, existed at that time in
the Southern States. Their economy was
founded on slavery. But a world-wide abolitionist movement among the white races
spread to America and caused deep concern
to the puritanical section of the North. The
issue became a very serious one in the
eighteen-thirties. Those who have read the
speeches of that great orator and statesman
Daniel Webster will recall the brilliant utterances he made in the United States Senate in
his debates with Calhoun and Hayne on the
questions of slavery and state rights.

The issue of state rights, with its accompanying propaganda on both sides, continued to be a very live and bitter question
from the eighteen-thirties onwards, and early
in 1861 the first shot in the so-called Civil
War was fired at Fort Sumter. The controversy in that war was whether the federal
union should be preserved, or whether a
number of individual southern states should
be able to declare themselves an independent
confederacy and maintain the institution of
slavery in their economy. The propaganda
carried on before the war broke out was most
violent. There are echoes of it at intervals
even now, for instance in the reading of that
old story "Uncle Tom's Cabin", or in the
presentation of it as a play.
The principle of state rights was contended
for by the southern states, whose population
totalled about 10 million; and the principle
of preservation of the union inspired the
northern states, with a total population of
about 20 million.
The opposing forces
arrayed themselves against one another and
a bloody war was fought for five years, not
so very far south of where I am standing at

the present moment. A few weeks ago in
an address I gave in this chamber I referred
to some of the great wars of history, but I
deliberately omitted any mention of this war
between the Northern and Southern States
on the issue of state rights. At the end of
five years of bloody fighting the North
triumphed, in 1865, but the price paid for
the abolition of slavery-in killed, wounded
and treasure-was enormous. In the South
its effects are still felt.
The point I wish to emphasize is that when
our own statesmen were endeavouring to
bring about a union of the Canadian provinces they had fresh in their minds and
immediately present the terrible results of
the war that had just been fought to preserve the United States federal union, under
whose constitution the residuary powers
were given to the individual states instead of
to the federal authority. In these circumstances the Fathers of Confederation felt it
wise to insist that in Canada the residuary
powers should be given to the federal
government.
That view was expressed by Sir John A.
Macdonald and others in the Debates on the
Quebec Resolutions of 1864. Sir John initially
wanted the unitary type of government in
this country, primarily to avoid the great
difficulties that had brought on internecine
strife to the south of us, but finally he compromised for the present Canadian type of
federal union.
In discussing constitutional questions under
the British North America Act I am aware

SENATE
that I, like one of the preceding speakers,
am not a lawyer however, I know something
of the decisions made by Lord Watson of the
Imperial Privy Council that have diminished
our federal powers.
The Act which this bill would amend provides that the federal government may prohibit the importation from one province to
another of certain dairy products or products
declared to be dairy products. - I foresee that
all this will be done either in the provincial
application or for provincial reasons. That
is an overemphasis of provincial rights, and
is distinctly contrary to reasons that led to
the Canadian type of federal government.
Obviously it was the wish of our own founding fathers that we should not blindly and
without looking for the reason behind certain
clauses in the British North America Act,
increase the powers of the provinces to the
detriment of the federal government. The
Act passed at the last session is a design to
get around some of those clauses; and also
I sec behind it an application from one
province which does not wish certain products admitted within its borders. Thus a
provincial application has for various reasons
been carried to the federal level for the purpose of prohibiting the export of dairy products from one province to another.
The passage of this Act indicates to me
that we are proceeding on very dangerous
ground, for we cannot tell what the future
holds.
I would stress the fact that we
should remain strong at the federal level,
for with our advance into the international
field we are being called upon to join large
and perhaps larger international units to
meet the threats of the present day. It is
very dangerous to weaken our unifying
federal strength.
I offer my support to the bill now before
us, not on the grounds of the transport of
margarine and not for free trade in other
dairy products, but on the general grounds
of the original causes and reasons for our
Canadian type of federation.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
am not ready to discuss the subject now
before the house; but as I may be away
from the chamber for some days, I should like
to say a few words at this time.
The explanation of the measure given by
the honourable senator fron Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), interested me very much, and I
think he should be commended for having
brought the subject before the house. I am
sure the discussion to follow will be
most enlightening and informative to us and
to the people of Canada. In the course of
his explanation he gave some information
which I thought might have a particular

bearing on the subject, and I should like at
this time to throw a point into the debate
so that those senators with legal training
may consider it as the discussion goes on.
My honourable friend made reference to
section 121 of the British North America Act
and said that the Act which the bill would
amend was a violation of that section. The
section reads:
All articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from and
after the Union, be admitted free into each of the
other provinces.
The wording of that section confirms me
in the opinion that free trade, as we call it
in Canada, is confined to the products of
Canada, and that under this section only
those products can be sent freely from one
province to another.
The thought cornes

to me that the centralized departmental
stores and brokers who import goods from
other countries and ship them into other
provinces of Canada could meet with difficulty under this section 121. Indeed, it may
be that the free admission of these products
to all parts of Canada is not included under
the British North America Act.
The question arises: How should we define
products of Canada? Does the Act of which
my honourable friend complains really violate
the provisions of the British North America
Act?
I am not prepared to give the answer to
these questions, but as I will not have an
opportunity to speak further on the subject,
I place these observations before the bouse.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancour±: Honourable senators, not being a lawyer, I should perhaps
refrain from discussing the various clauses
of the British North America Act. However,
my experience with lawyers is that when two
of them discuss the meaning of a section of
the law in Court, one argues that it is white
and the other is equally sure that it is black.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: I think we ought to
look at the situation as ordinary laymen. We
should appreciate the fact that before confederation there were in Canada four provinces. I am sure that if it had been known
that some day confederation would become
an instrument to destroy the economy of a
province, Quebec would not have entered
confederation; and if the spirit of the compact is to be violated, I will be ready to
take up the fight and tell my people that
confederation should be rejected. The federal government is here to protect the interests of every province, because, I repeat, the
Canadian
federation
was
built by the
provinces.

MAY 7, 1952
Next, let me point out that the act is not
applicable to al classes of trade, but only
to dairy products. Some provinces-Prince
Edward Island and. Quebec particularlyare primarily interested in agriculture, and
they want that interest to be protected. It
is hard enough to protect one's house against
fires without having people coming around
and spraying the walls with gasoline. So
far this law has been on the statute books
only one year, and it has not yet been applied.
I am not a lawyer and I do not discuss the
principle of the law; but I say that as a
matter of good sense it is the business of the
federal government to protect provinces
which ask for aid to save their fundamental
industry.
Some of my friends have referred to the
freedom which, in their opinion, characterizes
the United States, and last week we heard
visiting friends from the other side discuss
an organization to prevent war and promote
peace. But it is well to look at the other
side of the picture. We see the present plight
of the steel industry and other troubles of
the same kind. We know that in some of
the American States coloured people are
denied admission to hotels, clubs and other
places of public resort. Is that their conception of a free state?
That is practically all I have to say. The
honourable senator from St. John's (Hon. Mr.
Baird), who is from Newfoundland, said, "We
are al Canadians. I am a Canadian." So
also are we in Quebec. We live in that province; we have been Canadians for more than
three hundred years, and we built our country before any people from some other lands
came here. I warn my honourable friends
that if the basis of confederation is disturbed,
we may be forced to quit confederation.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Before the debate is
adjourned I wish to say a word or two. First,
let me compliment the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) upon having introduced this bill and say how pleased
I am at the tenor of the debate, in that we
are not discussing margarine, good or bad,
but the principle of restrictions as between
one province and another.
As the honourable senator from Waterloo
reminded us, the Dairy Products Act was
introduced in the dying days of last session;
and if it was not stated publicly in this
chamber, it was at least intimated that the
government wanted it put through as quickly
as possible. It will be remem'bered that the
Minister of Agriculture was not here at the
time to explain the bill to the committee.
Many members accepted the plea of urgency.
I can understand why some members of the
other place might heed these representations,

but I do not understand why the Senate
failed to give the "second look," which is
its function, and passed the bill so rapidly.
Of course we realize now that the provisions
of the Act have not been implemented.
Obviously there must have been some false
pretences about the urgency of the legislation;
and I for one am, shall I say, somewhat
annoyed, after having been told that story,
to find out now that the bill we were asked
to expedite has not been put into effect. Why
ah the hurry? ýIt is well known that it was
put through for the sake of one province.
It would be very unfortunate if in a debate
of this kind sectionalism should arise. As
far as I am concerned, speaking as one who
was born in the Old Land, I do not accept
thé idea that anyone is especially entitled to
talk about being "Canadian", because each
and every one of us is a Canadian. I come
from the province of British Columbia, which
organized itself and passed its own laws,
and has been peopled mostly by persons
from the British Isles. We are ah Canadians
now.
It seems to me that the voice of protest is
getting weaker and weaker, and that we
are accepting without objection almost any
law which is demanded by dominion or provincial governments. As a real Liberal, and
speaking not in a political sense but from a
democratic point of view, I hope that in this
chamber that voice of protest will never be
silenced.
This is not the first time that the restrictive
principle has been embodied in legislation.
I well remember a clause in the Fisheries
Act under which the government had the
right to prevent the movement, without a
permit, of canned salmon from one province
to another. At that time I raised the issue
in the House of Commons. Whatever personal feeling any honourable member may
have about the late Lord Bennett, I think
everyone will admit that he was no mean
lawyer; and when I drew attention to this
clause in the other place he said, "It is not
worth the paper it is written on"; and it
never became law.
A similar tendency to restriction is at
work in the provinces. We find that last
year British Columbia tried to stop the
importation of eggs from Alberta; and
recently it placed an embargo against the
entry of cattle from Alberta. I view these
things with alarm; they tend to provoke
retaliation. You put an embargo on certain
goods from another province, and its people,
being human, will seize the chance to do
the same thing to you in connection with
some other class of goods which you want
to sel to them.

SENATE
Honourable senators, we have an opportunity at this time to vindicate the good name
of the Senate; and I trust we shall not see
a repetition of what took place in the vote
last year in the dying days of the session.
I am pleased to stand in my place and champion this measure because there is a principle
at stake. As has been well pointed out,
these restrictions will be the beginning of ten
balkanized provinces. We can already see
evidences of this tendency in the embargoes
which certain provinces have imposed against
others. After all, this is really a matter for
the jurisdiction of the federal government,
but for political reasons the federal authorities were afraid to move in and tell the
provinces that this right did not belong to
the provinces.
Honourable senators, I will support this
bill, and I hope the Senate will pass it.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, if
permitted, perhaps I may speak from the
opposition's side of the house, which is a
strange place to me.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You may be on this side
some day.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My contribution will be
brief. The honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), with his unfailing
good humour, bas just mentioned the fact
that I may be sitting on this side some day.
That is quite possible. One never knows
what the future may unfold, but I may say
to my honourable friend that the signs at
the moment are not propitious for that event
happening to me.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Unfortunately, and quite
unavoidably, I was absent last year when the
discussion took place in the Senate on Bill
403, an Act to establish national standards for
dairy products and to regulate interprovincial
and international trade in dairy products. I
have no hesitation in saying that had I been
here I should have opposed the legislation
in the form in which it was introduced, and
so it may be inferred quite readily that I
am supporting the bill brought in by the
honourable member for Waterloo.
As I think is incumbent upon members of
this honourable house, I desire briefly to give
the reasons why I support his bill.
The legislation which we seek to amend,
by any rule that you may wish to apply,
was a rather remarkable production.
It
has been a cardinal principle in our history
since confederation that trade between the
provinces should move freely and unrestricted.

No one, so far as my knowledge goes, ever
thought of challenging that principle and
there was no wiser provision in the constitution as framed by those far-seeing men of
85 years ago than the provision that trade
between the provinces should be free and
untrammelled. I think the honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) has interpreted this section much too
narrowly, and I doubt if he will find much
support for the point he has raised.
I hold that the bill as passed last year
directly contravenes the practice since confederation, and directly opposes the principle
upon which the framers of our constitution
wrote section 121 into the British North
America Act. It is true that the section
which we seek to amend opens the door only
a little way; but it does open the door, and
it lays down the principle that the federal
government, by regulation entrusted to the
administration of the Minister of Agriculture,
may prohibit the passing from one province
to another of any dairy product that contains
fat or oil other than that of milk. This extends further than the matter of margarine. I
have been informed that in the manufacture
of ice cream; for instance, edible fats are
sometimes used when there is a shortage of
other material. This has no deleterious effect
on ice cream, with the wonders of modern
science, ice cream can be just as nutritional
and healthful when made with certain classes
of edible fats as it can be when wholly natural
products are used.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my honourable friend
mean vegetable fats when he speaks of edible
fats?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. I thank my honourable friend for his correction. The bill as
passed last year also imposes a ban on the
movement between provinces of any substitute for milk, cream, butter and other dairy
products. This would mean that once this Act
has been proclaimed-and it appears to me
rather significant that it has not yet been proclaimed-the federal government may proceed
to frame regulations prohibiting the passage
from one province to another of the commodity that it designates. Let us assume for
the sake of argument that this product is margarine. This establishes a principle in interprovincial trade to which I completely object.
If, under the legislation as passed last year,
we can empower the government to prohibit
by regulation the passing of a product of
this kind from, say, New Brunswick to Prince
Edward Island, what is to hinder a government using this precedent in order to bring in
a bill to restrict the passage of fish products
from one province to another? It is my contention that once you accept the principle and
admit that it has a certain validity in the

MAY 7, 1952
matter of interprovincial trade, you open the
door to vistas of which you cannot see the
end. That is why I am opposed to the bill
as passed last year, and why I support the
amendment moved by our colleague from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
It was precisely this sort of thing, I
submit, that the framers of our constitution
had in mind when they devised the Senate.
What was meant by the arguments in the preconfederation debates leading up to the inauguration of our constitution and favouring
the establishment of a Senate composed of
members whose appointment was for life, and
the membership of which was based on an
entirely different principle than the population of their respective provinces? Surely the
intention was that this body should guard
aganst just the sort of legislation that the
bill before us seeks to repeal. When Macdonald used the argument-and it was a very
illustrative argument-that
one of the
Senate's responsibilities would be to take
a sober second look at legislation, I am convinced that he had in mind just the kind of
legislation that we put through in the bill
passed a year ago.
I urge the Senate to place itself squarely on
record by supporting the bill that our colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) has
sponsored so ably this afternoon. It may
be said that the legislation which the bill
would amend is not of much importance, that
it affects only one commodity, and that there
is a good deal of controversy about that
commodity. But the commodity is not the
important thing. The important thing is
the principle that we sanctioned and accepted
when we passed the legislation a year ago.
That principle is a danger to the unity of this
country, and we should abolish it now, not
wait until after it has been applied to a
much wider field and done great and possibly permanent damage to our national
unity.
The framers of our constitution were farseeing men. As has often been said in this
house, the result of their handiwork in the
Canada that we have today is a supreme
justification of the vision, imagination and
wisdom that they proved themselves to possess when they drafted the British North
America Act.
My last words are that we should be very
careful before we throw out of the window
those safeguards that the Fathers of Confederation provided for .our national unity
when they framed our constitution.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable senators, I think it is very fortunate for the people
of Canada that the Dairy Products Act of last
55708-14

year, being as bad as it is, has never been
brought into effect, for we can say that thus
far we have suffered no ill effects from it.
I think that the excuse that honourable
senators did not have time for proper consideration of the bill last June, in the dying
days of the session, is a poor one. If our
purpose here is, as we say it is, to protect
the interests of the smaller provinces, we
should do that, and we should not excuse any
action that we take on a bill by saying that
the bill came to us too late.
To my mind, paragraph (c) of clause 6 of
last year's bill appears to have been aimed
largely at the provinces of Quebec and Prince
Edward Island, where margarine cannot be
legally sold. The senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has just said, in effect,
that it is unthinkable that any product could
not be shipped from, say, New Brunswick to
Prince Edward Island. Well, during the last
two years margarine could be legally shipped
from New Brunswick to Prince Edward
Island, but nobody wanted to ship any, for
the sale of margarine is prohibited on the
Island. You can give it away, or store it or
eat it, but you cannot sell it there.
Like the mover of the bill (Hon. Mr. Euler),
I am not a lawyer, but I venture to say that
if last year's Act were put into force some
eminent lawyers would arrange means for
having it brought before the courts for a
decision as to whether it is valid or not.
Canada Packers Limited are manufacturing
margarine in Toronto, let us sayi Well, there
is not at present, nor would there be even
if the Act were proclaimed, anything at '1l
to prevent them from shipping their product
to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia or any
other province where it can be sold legally.
The object of the Act, I imagine, is to keep
margarine from being shipped into the
provinces of Quebec and Prince Edward
Island.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my friend
from Prince Edward Island? I did not mention the word "margarine"Hon. Mr. Barbour: I know you did not.
Hon. Mr. Euler: -and it was not in my
mind. I am urging that last year's Act be
amended because it violates a basic principle,
namely-, free trade between the provinces of
this country.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: The sale of liquor was
prohibited in Prince Edward Island for a
long time, and common carriers would not
accept liquor for delivery in the province.
What happened? Some people got the idea
that they could open a liquor warehouse
there; and in fact two persons went there,
opened liquor storehouses, paid a licence fee,

SENATE
brought liquor into the province and shipped
it out. And it seems to me that under the
British North America Act margarine could
be shipped into and out of our province today. For example, margarine manufactured
in one of the plants of Canada Packers, at
Toronto or elsewhere, could, I think, be shipped to Charlottetown, stored there and reshipped to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.
The legislature has prohibited the sale of
margarine on the Island, but I do not think
that there could be any legal interference
with margarine in transit through Prince
Edward Island to another province.
The dairy business and the beef cattle
business in this country are going through
pretty difficult days right now, and we do
not know how many more difficulties they
will face in the future. Farmers are going
to have on their hands a lot of dairy cows
that they will not be able to sell in the
United States this year. Those cows will
have to be milked, if people can be found to
milk them, and our butter supply will be
larger than usual. Butter has already become somewhat cheaper; in Prince Edward
Island it dropped 8 cents a pound within the
last week. There is no overseas contract for
cheese, and Ontario is going to have an
abundance of this product. These are just
a few facts which make it appear certain
that dairymen will be confronted with quite
a lot of trouble this year. And since the
Dairy Products Act of last year bas not
been brought into force, and as we have had
no ill effects from it thus far, and probably
never shall, I suggest that until it does some
harm we leave it just as it is.
Hon. W. A. Buchanan: Honourable senators, as I may not be here for a great part
of the remainder of the session, I feel that,
ta be honest with myself, I should say a few
words on the measure before us.
I am completely in favour of the bill.
Like my colleague from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), I was absent from the chamber
last year when the Act which this bill
would amend was passed. Had I been
present, I would have opposed it.
I entered public life as a supporter of an
old theory, which I sometimes feel is regarded
as worn out: I believe in free trade.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I believe in free trade
in a much wider sense than its application
to the Dominion of Canada. Even in these
modern times we hear people say that we
need more of it, but we seem to be getting
less and less of it. I think it would be
very serious if we here in Canada were to
do anything to restrict trade within our own
boundaries. If I supported such action I

would be going contrary to the principle
that I was brought up on politically, and which
I confess I still believe in. If a measure of
the character of the one now before us can
be made to apply to one industry, certainly
another one can be brought in at some later
date to apply to some other industry. The
principle of the thing is wrong and I want
to go on record at this moment as saying that
although I do not expect to be in the house
when a vote is taken, I am in favour of the
measure introduced by the honourable senator
from Waterloo.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: Honourable senators, I
understand that it is the intention of the
honourable leader of the government to
adjourn the debate so that he may have an
opportunity of studying this measure and,
no doubt of consulting with his colleagues.
I presume that he does not intend ta prohibit further debate on the question. That is
all I have to say.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. D. Euler moved the second reading of Bill D-7, an Act respecting the Economical Mutual Fire Insurance Company.
Some Hon. Senators: Carried!
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I
gather that there are those in the house who
do not wish an explanation of this measure.
The bill is merely for the purpose of changing the name of the Economical Mutual Fire
Insurance Company by dropping the word
"Fire". The business of the company no
longer includes only fire insurance, and this
measure would make the name of the company more properly descriptive.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I support the bill; indeed,
I dare not take any other stand, because my
firm are the solicitors for this company in
Western Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

evident, even from an economic and safety
point of view, that drastic action is called for.
No less an authority than J. Edgar Hoover,
head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
in the United States, advises that filthy literature is the great moron maker, and is casting
criminals faster than his country can build
prisons to house them. Judges of Juvenile
Courts speaking from court experience offer
the same unhappy testimony.
The Canadian Justice Department reportedly is offering the suggestion that the problem is one that lends itself to law enforcement.
This is a view which is not concurred in by
majority thinking, nor has this suggestion
stood up under the hard strain of practical
experience. If the minister is correct, the
laws of Canada are held in the most supreme
contempt and their enforcement officers meet
with superlative defiance.
It is true that there are four sections of
the Criminal Code dealing with the features
under discussion-sections 207, 207-A, 208 and
209. Actually there are five, if we consider
section 1035, subsection 3, which provides
penalties by way of fines in the case of
corporations.
Section 207 deals with obscene or immoral
books and pictures, indecent shows, offering
of drugs; with provisoes regarding public
good and questions of determination. Section
207 (a) relates to offences arising out of court
proceedings. In this instance prosecutions
cannot be instituted except with the consent
of the Attorney General. Section 208 covers
immoral theatrical performances.
Section
209 refers to posting obscene publications,
letters and postcards, and letters to deceive
or defraud.
Under section 207, crime comics are covered
to a somewhat satisfactory degree; but the
term is the only one in the several sections
dignified by a proper definition. In all justice
it must be admitted that section 207 appears
on the surface to be quite conclusive, but the
acid test of its efficiency lies in the fact that
it is regarded in the main as a legal scarecrow under which literary birds of ill repute
shelter from the storm.
It is time to settle this question, to place
responsibility, to demand respect for our laws
if they are sufficiently enforceable, or to
strengthen them if they are deemed insufficient and ineffective. Protest upon protest
and aroused public opinion call for immediate
and unstinted effort. The time for letting
matters take care of themselves is past. The
future in this instance is no longer remote.
Yesterday's future is here today; today's
future will be with us tomorrow. Each brings
in regard to this matter the same relentless
problem. To do nothing towards its solution is one of the sins of omission for which

each of us must answer in conscience, and
for which governments must answer at the
bar of public opinion. Any waiting attitude
at this juncture indicates a lack of attention
or indifference to public demand. The latter
is neither local or parochial. The issue has
become nation-wide. Indeed, from every area
of Canada advocates of clean and sanitary
reading have given vocal expression of their
dissatisfaction over current trends.
In the province of New Brunswick the Most
Rev. P. A. Bray, C.J.M., Bishop of Saint John,
has called for a reawakening of the Christian
conscience in respect of the flow of indecency
and immorality from news stands, and has
sponsored a decent-literature crusade with an
appeal to readers, dealers and civic authorities. The response has been spontaneous. His
Excellency's supporters include the Lieutenant
Governor of the province, members of
the judiciary, provincial and civic officials,
church organizations and persons from every
walk of life. Under this gifted leadership the
campaign to shun indecent publications promises to be far-reaching and impressive. In the
province of Ontario the Parent and Teachers'
Association has voiced a vigorous demand for
remedial measures. At a recent meeting held
in Ottawa, Bishop John C. Cody of London
and Mayor Charlotte Whitton of Ottawa
expressed their personal indignation at the
vicious and pernicious aspects of factors
destructive of decency and morality. The
Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities states that a resolution will go before
its national convention in Calgary at the end
of June in protest against present laxities in
regulating the sale and distribution of salacious literature. Boycott schemes have received
wide support as deterrents and as instructive measures to news dealers who show reluctance to be guided by an awakened public
conscience. The Canadian Federation of Convent Alumni are joining a worldwide movement to dedicate Mother's Day of the present
year as an occasion for placing their views
on this vexed question prominently before
the public, and in particular to impress upon
dealers the economic dangers of continuing
in this type of sale and distribution.
It is unnecessary to say more. The elimination of publications morally unwholesome
should be the aim of every citizen. I appeal,
therefore, to every senator in this house, not
as crusaders but as respectable members of
society, to meet a civic and Christian duty.
I appeal to them particularly on behalf of
children, to co-operate in a plan designed to
protect them against a violation of their right
to live and grow in an atmosphere of mental
decency.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I am sure that the excellent and

SENATE
eloquent speech just delivered by the mover
of this resolution has dispelled any doubt
about the importance of this matter.
At this time I should just like to refer
to the technical questions involved in conducting an investigation into this subject. I
had hoped, after the honourable senator had
introduced his motion, to have a word with
him about the technical phases of this matter.
I do not want to discourage this inquiry,
because I have always urged honourable
senators to take an interest in questions of
public concern, of which this is an excellent
example.
I do not know what the honourable senator has in mind as to the organization of this
proposed committee, but as most committee
inquiries are reported, the work of this
committee would have a direct bearing on
our reportorial staff whose capacity, taxed
under ordinary conditions, will be taxed to
an even greater extent in the immediate
future. I think I have already mentioned
that one major piece of legislation coming
before us will be the revision of the Criminal
Code, and I have been advised today that
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
will come to this house to explain his important citizenship bill, which is certain to be
dealt with by one of our committees. I am
only drawing this matter to my honourable
friend's attention. I do not want to appear
to be discouraging his activities in any way,
but rather as applauding them.
The motion was agreed to.
NEW BRUNSWICK POTATO GROWERS
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

I therefore ask the Minister of Agriculture to
make representations to that firm, so that justice be
rendered to all those who were unable to market
their products.
Moreover, all potato growers were to benefit
equally, from the generosity of the government,
which had earmarked a rather large amount to
assist them and alleviate their losses.
Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Haig: I rise to a point of order.
I do not desire to stop the honourable gentleman from proceeding, but I doubt if the rules
of the Senate permit us to discuss in this
chamber a question raised by a member in
another place. I think this would lead to

turmoil between the two houses. My honourable friend can bring the matter before this
house by moving a resolution to authorize
an investigation and ask the honourable
member from the other chamber to come
here and substantiate his statement, but I do
not believe the matter can be the subject of

a question of privilege in this house.
The Hon. the Speaker: It seems to me
that the honourable senator from Victoria-

Carleton (Hon. Mr. Pirie) has not yet reached
the point of stating how he personally or
his firm is concerned with the statement
made in the other house. If that statement
attacked a general policy, then I think the
point of order raised by the honourable the
leader of the opposition (Hon Mr. Haig) is
well taken; but if the statement constitutes
wha-t the honourable senator from VictoriaCarleton considers a charge against either
himself personally or his firm, I take it that
he has a right to proceed.

Hon. Mr. Pirie: Honourable senators, I
do not read 5 per cent of the speeches that
are delivered in the other place, and this
particular one was made in French, so it
entirely escaped my notice at the time. It
does, however, reflect on a company of which
I happen to be president, and I think I
should have the privilege of defending myself;
and that I owe it to this Senate, as an
honourable body, to give an explanation.
Last year, I asked the Minister of Agriculture However, I am guided by the rules of the
(Mr. Gardiner) to give careful consideration to the
complaints and representations of the farmers of Senate and the rulings of His Honour the
my county in order to secure subsidies for their Speaker; and if at any time you rule me out

no satisfaction in this regard.
A delegation from New Brunswick came to to bow to your ruling. In his speech Mr.
Ottawa in order to ask the competent authorities Dubé, the member for Restigouche-Madaof the department, for subsidies to assist the waska, made certain assertions that I think
farmers who were unable to find markets for their
products. After some lengthy discussions, the it is quite proper for me to refute. He said-

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. F. W. Pirie: Honourable senators,

with I wish to rise on a question of privilege.
On March 18 of this year a speech was
delivered in the other place by the representative for the counties of RestigoucheMadawaska, Mr. P. L. Dube, in which he is
reported in Hansard as saying:

department decided to pay a subsidy of $300,000 to
those farmers who would deliver their potatoes to
the starch company. But, I am sorry to say, only

a few farmers were favoured. A farmer who had
failed to buy his fertilizer from that starch company was unable to make them accept his product.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, I rise to a
point of order. If I can get a seconder, I

move that Your Honour's ruling, which I
think is incorrect, should be appealed from.

MAY 8, 1952
The Hon. the Speaker: Is that motion
seconded?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) seconds
the motion.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
on a point of order, may I suggest that
instead of appealing from the ruling of His
Honour the Speaker it might be more practical-I am simply offering this as a suggestion to the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) -to request His Honour
to ask the honourable senator from Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr. Pirie) to state his
question of privilege. I think we are not
allowed to quote in this house speeches
made in the other houseHon. Mr. Haig: During the same session.
Hon. Mr. Vien: When an honourable senator wants to raise a question of privilege he
must state the facts which affect his privilege, but it is not permissible to quote from
a speech made in the other house. If it
is agreeable to the mover of the motion (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I would suggest that perhaps His
Honour should request our colleague from
Victoria-Carleton to state his point of privilege, without quoting the speech.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to make it clear
that I have every sympathy with the desire
of the honourable senator from VictoriaCarleton (Hon. Mr. Pirie) to make an explanation. In my opinion, what was done in the
other house was an awful thing to do. I
appreciate that the senator ought to be
allowed to defend his honour; but if we
start the practice of quoting from speeches
made in the other house during the current
session we are bound to get into a tangle
with that house, and contradictions will be
flung back and forth between the two chambers. That would be most undesirable, and I
do not think it is permissible under the rules.
However, so as to enable our colleague to
make his explanation, I am quite willing to
consent to allowing him to proceed. In that
way I shall be just as responsible as he is for
the procedure that we follow in this instance.
But I do want to keep within the rules whenever possible.
The Hon. the Speaker: As I understand it,
the honourable senator from VictoriaCarleton was about to read a few words
from the speech made in the other house, for
the purpose of setting out in as brief a way
as possible the basis of his point of privilege.
I gathered that he felt he could make his
point clearer if he repeated exactly what had
been said instead of attempting to give his

own version of it. He stated that the statement made in the other house affected himself and his company, and in my view he
has a right to explain to this house what
part of that speech he considers was untrue.
I agree with the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that it would be
desirable to state the point of privilege without quoting from what was said in the other
house, but I take it that the honourable senator from Victoria-Carleton felt that time
could be saved by making a direct quotation.
I trust that the Senate will give leave to the
honourable gentleman to continue his remarks,
but I would ask him to keep them within as
brief a compass as possible.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: Mr. Speaker, I do not wish
to embarrass anyone in this house, so I shall
postpone the matter until another occasion.
Some Hon. Senators: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators,
may I say a word? I seconded the motion of
my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig), but
I certainly do not wish to prevent the honourable gentleman from Victoria-Carleton (Hon.
Mr. Pirie) from stating his point of privilege.
He has every right to defend himself, but
I think he should say what his point of privilege is and then proceed.
Hon. Mr. Pirie: I wil refer to the matter
on another occasion.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt moved second reading of Bill F-7, an Act to incorporate the
Equitable Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Equitable
Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated by provincial charter in 1901 under
the law of the Province of Quebec. The
purpose of this bill is to incorporate a federal
company which will carry on the operations
of the present company and assume its
assets and liabilities.
I would point out that a number of insurance companies operating under a charter
from the Province of Quebec have been given
federal jurisdiction by the passage of legislation similar to the measure now before the
house. For instance, federal status has been
given to the following insurance companies: The Standstead & Sherbrooke Insurance
Company, 4 Geo. VI, ch. 51; the Canadian
Mercantile Insurance Company, 1 Geo. VI,
ch. 46; the Commerce Mutual Fire Insurance
Company, 17 Geo. V, ch. 90; and the Missisquoi and Rouville Insurance Company, 15
Geo. VI, ch. 72.
The new company when incorporated will
be subject to the provisions of the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
The present bill refers for the most part to
the operations of the company under the
mutual system, as governed by the insurance
law of the province of Quebec; about half of
the business of the company is carried on
under this system. As the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act, 1932, does
not provide for the selling of fire insurance
under that system, it is necessary in the bill
before us to make provision for such operations. The bill follows almost word for word
measures of a similar character passed by
parliament.

Honourable senators will note that the bill
provides that at least one-third of the board
of directors of the company must be elected
by the policy-holders of mutual insurance.
Such policyholders have the right to vote at
meetings of the company at a ratio of one
vote per $1,000 of insurance. This measure
would give to the new company the power
to purchase the rights and assets and to
assume the obligations and liabilities of the
Equitable Insurance Company.
I should point out that when this bill
reaches the committee stage an application
will be made to amend the title by adding
the word "fire". It appears that there are
already two or three insurance companies
known as the Equitable Insurance Company,
and to distinguish this company from the
others, it is proposed to call it the Equitable
Fire Insurance Company.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators.
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. G. Fogo moved the second reading
of Bill G-7, an Act respecting a certain patent
application of the Garrett Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
arises out of an amendment to the Patent
Act made in 1947 by which section 28A was
inserted. The effect of this section was to
give to persons who had filed applications for
patents in countries other than Canada, and
who during the recent war had had their
time for filing in Canada run out on them,
an opportunity within a limited period to
file their applications in this country. The
amendment extended the time- for filing such
applications to November 15, 1947, and a
rather strange feature of it was that it
required the applicant for a patent to make
application for an extension of time before
that date.
The petitioner in the bill before us is the
Garrett Corporation, which is the assignee
of one Max R. Brauns, 'an inventor. The
patent concerned in the measure has to do
with a certain gas turbine.
In 1944 this inventor obtained a patent in
the United States and assigned it to the

MAY 8, 1952
Garrett Corporation, with rights to apply for
a patent in Canada. Subsequently the Patent
Act was amended by the new section 28A; an
application for patent was quite properly
made in Canada, but inadvertently the
solicitors or patent attorneys acting for the
applicant omitted to include a request for an
extension of time. The time having expired,
the Commissioner of Patents in due course
ries that although the application was
otherwise in order, he was not competent to
consider it. Consequently, the effect of the
passage of this bill would be to permit or
direct the Commissioner of Patents to act
with respect to the said application in the
same way as if it had contained a request
for an extension of time as required by
section 28A.
Honourable senators will recall, as has just
been suggested to me, that there have been
two similar measures passed by this house,one in 1949, chapter 26, in the case of
W. Q. Beyer, and a similar Act in the statutes
of 1951, chapter 90, on behalf of one George
R. Hanks. I may say that the circumstances
here are similar.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Fogo moved that the bill be
referred to -the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADA

DAIRY PRODUCTS BILL
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Euler for the second reading of Bill B,
an Act to amend the The Canada Dairy
Products Act.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am not prepared to go ahead today with
what I have to say on this motion, and
therefore, under ordinary circumstances, I
would have askedi that it should stand. On
the other hand, at least one honourable senator, the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), would like to say
something about the bill, and as he will not
be here in the early part of next week I am
quite willing to stand aside at this time, upon
the understanding that I shall not forfeit
my right to adjourn the debate after he or
any other honourable senator has spoken.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Thank you,
honourable senators, and my leader. I cannot be here on Monday and Tuesday of next

191

week, and there are some observations which
I should like to make in connection with this
bill.
The subject of the bill is a matter of high
principle and, to be consistent with my past,
I think I should say something about it.
First, let me compliment very highly the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), on having introduced this biH, because
the principle involved is not a small matter
or one of passing moment, but one which
affects the nation to which we belong; and
in my humble opinion the honourable senator
has added lustre to an already distinguished
career and has left another footprint "in the
sands of time". If this bill is passed, and
in consequence we maintain what is a sound
principle in national affairs, the honourable
senator may be remembered in future years
for his contribution.
Also, by way of preliminary, I should like
to pass a compliment to the honourable
senator from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird) upon
what struck me as a very highly-finished,
very literary, and excellent speech. He is
one of the newer senators, and we of oider
standing may claim the right to congratulate
him and to express the hope that this will
not be the last time his voice is to be heard
in a well prepared and really splendid
address, such as he gave us yesterday. It
ran through my mind as he was delivering
that address that the new province of Newfoundland has sent to us something besides
its fish, good as they are. Its intellectual
contribution to our public and national life
is really worth while. One of the chief
benefits which Canada received when Newfoundland joined the confederation was that
we swept away the obstructions to trade
which then existed between that province
and the great country to which we belong.
I think I can also say with some assurance
that what Newfoundland gained most by her
entry into confederation was the clearing
away of the obstructions which Canada
imposed upon trade from that area. The free
and unrestricted intercourse, intellectual and
material, which came about by the union of
Newfoundland and the Dominion of Canada
was, perhaps, the greatest benefit which
flowed from that act.
I would also like to say a word of appreciation of the speech made by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg, who told us of the
experience along somewhat similar lines of
the great union to our south. I have -always
had in mind that the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 laid down certain
positive restrictions against interference with
trade between the states.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my honourable friend? When he spoke of the honourable senator from Winnipeg, I think he
meant the honourable senator from St.
Boniface.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I meant Senator Davis.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Most of the great men are

some interest a book from our library
entitled The Constitution of the United States,
Its Sources and Its Application, by a Mr.
Norton. On page 50 it gives the items of
the Constitution and then comments upon
them. One item in the Constitution is set
out as follows:

state imposes trade restrictions. The United States
throughout its wide territory Is a single commercial unit with full freedom of internai trade. In
this regard the United States is in marked contrast
with Europe, where racial and historical causes
have brought about the existence of many nations
each concerned with safeguarding its own internai
trade against the undue encroachment of the commerce of other countries.
Freedom of inter-state commerce has been as
great an aid to political success as to an economic
welfare. The commerce clause of the constitution
made a united country possible; in spite of sectional
divergencies and a civil war, the nation has been
held together and the states have grown into an
indissoluble union because industry, trade, transport
and communication have known nothing of state
boundaries or of political differences. The power
"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and
among the several states" is vested in congress by
the constitution which also stipulates that "No state
shall, without the consent of the congress, lay any
imposts or duties on imports or exports, except
what may be absolutely necessary for executing
its inspection laws"; also that "No state shahl, without the consent of the congress, lay any duty on
tonnage." The constitution provides that congress
shall levy no tax or duty "on articles exported from
any state," and that "No preference shall be given
by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the
ports of one state over those of another.

That is the clearest statement you will find
of the situation to the south of us. The
regulation of trade and commerce by the
United States Congress has led to a complete
freedom of trade over the largest free trade

perity, as an act prohibiting pipe-line companies
from transporting except between points within the
state.
After the constitution was adopted and while it
was before the conventions of the states for ratification, Washington wrote to Lafayette that his
own state had recently tried to pass "some of the
most extravagant and preposterous edicts on the
subject of trade" that had ever been written . . .
But with years and experience the belief has
grown that while the citizen of the state may naturally favour development at home, the same person
as a citizen of the nation must take into account
the welfare of al the states.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, certainly.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is it not a fact that the laws
of the United States, such as you have just
read, served as a guide in the forming of our
constitution?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Undoubtedly so, and
I intended to pass from the United States
Constitution to our own.
That was the
natural evolution which took place. The philosophy that I have expressed in these two
excerpts-the common sense of the people of
the United States and the loyalty they gave
to their country-resulted in free interchange and the maintenance of the rule
against any break in it. There have been

MAY 8, 1952
thousands of attempts to circumvent that
rule, but the courts and congress and even
state legislatures have set their faces against
it, and have maintained, as I hope we shall
in this house, the right of a member of any
state to trade freely with a member of
another state. The law and the principles
involved finally found legislative enactment
and codification in the ýInterstate Commerce
Act, which is now upon the statute books,
and which probably ends for ail time any
subversive attempt such as we find here.
I think it was the honourable senator for
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) who remarked
that the founders of our constitution, the
Fathers of Confederation, were very wise
men. But they had more than mere native
wisdom; they had the experience of the
people of the United States. As my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) pointed out, they were guided
by the American Constitution, with its commerce clauses. They also had the benefit of
the experience gained from the time of the
Philadelphia Convention of 1787 down to
the enactment of our own constitution in
1867. This was quite a period of time. During it there occurred the war between the
North and the South and the struggles
between the states over their boundaries.
But all these differences disappeared in the
harmony of a single nation.
The Fathers of Confederation knew all
about the struggles that interested parties
had put up to restrict trade and commerce
for tieir own selfish purposes, and that is
why they wrote section 121 into the British
North America Act-to provide that manufactured articles -as well as articles of growth
and produce should pass freely from one
province to another. There is no question of
their intention that there should be no tariff
barriers, no quotas and no private interests
hiding behind governmental legislation in
order to obstruct trade between our provinces,
and thus break up our country. The writer
Norton, whom I quoted, makes the observation that in the United States had it not been
for the rule of free intercourse between
states, the individual states themselves would
have wrecked the Union. I think I can
apply these words to Canada: Were it not
for the common sense of our people and the
statesmanship of our legislators, and the
fact that we have set our minds against
restrictions between provinces, the provinces
,could wreck our confederation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Act which we
passed last year is not of great importance
in itself, but it is the entering wedge. If

we allow it to stand on our statute books it
will be followed as a precedent many and
many times in the future.
Last night I entertained myself by browsing
through the Confederation Debates, which are
kept in the Parliament Library and are very
well worth any time spent on reading them.
I picked out excerpt after excerpt dealing
with free trade between the provinces, and
on this point the speakers were practically
unanimous, although the views expressed
by them on most other points having to do
with confederation were far removed from
unanimity.
I will just quote a few brief statements.
The Honourable A. Campbell, of Cataraqui,
who at the time was Commissioner of Crown
Lands, saidHon. Mr. Burchill: Where was he speaking?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The debate was in the
Legislature of Canada, prior to confederation,
and the members were discussing the Confederation Resolutions, which proposed that
Canada petition the Queen for an Act to
bring about union of the provinces.
Mr. Campbell said:
Honourable gentlemen say, where is the advantage to be gained by Canada from confederation?
Well now, can any honourable gentleman in his
senses believe that the removal of the obstacles to
intercourse between the provinces, the doing away
with the customs duties, and the development of
the trade of the St. Lawrence, is no advantage to
Canada? Can it be said that to open up the commerce with three millions of people along the
St. Lawrence and the lakes will be no advantage to
the people of the lower provinces?

He was enthusiastically in favour of confederation because of its economic advantages
through free trade among our provinces.
The Honourable the Solicitor General, Mr.
Langevin, of Dorchester, said:
There are also as many different tariffs as there
are different provinces, as many commercial and
customs regulations as provinces. It is true that
there are now many free goods, but it is also
correct to say that there are as many customs
systems as there are provinces . . . By this it
will be understood thgt it is almost impossible to
reconcile so many different interests, except by
uniting in one and the same legislature the representatives of those interests and of the people
affected by them, and this object we cannot attain
by remaining by ourselves.

Mr. Walsh, of Norfolk constituency, said:
We must necessarily consider the question in
connection with the more intimate commercial
intercourse which it is contemplated will resuit
from the construction of the Intercolonial Railway.
A new market for our commodities will be opened
up by the removal of the barriers to trade which
now exist between us. Believing, as I do, that our
commercial relations with our sister provinces
should be free and unrestricted, I am heartily in
favour of the construction of this railway.

SENATE
The building of the Intercolonial Railway
was part and parcel of the confederation
proposal.
Mr. Dorion, of Drummond and Arthabaska,
said:
That which built up the commercial prosperity of
the United States is their geographical positiontheir immense territory, in which is to be found
every climate imaginable; from the north, producing ice, to the south, producing the most
delicious fruits. An inhabitant of Maine may load
a vessel with ice, proceed to New Orleans and
barter his cargo of ice for rice, sugar, tobacco, etc.,
with which he may return home without paying a
single farthing of customs duties. It is this free
and continual exchange of their various products
from Maine to California which bas placed the
United States in the first rank of commercial
nations in so short a time.

Mr. M.

stated:

C.

Cameron,

of

North

Ontario,

We now have five independent, and I may say
hostile tariffs-

Honourable senators will realize that at that
time there were just the five original divisions, corresponding to what are now the
provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and the three
provinces in the Maritimes. He said:
We now have five independent and, I may say,
hostile tariffs-a different one in each of the
colonies; and we have five different governments.
We will then have one strong independent government and one system of customs taxation.

That was what appealed to him in the idea

of confederation.
As I read over those Debates I saw no
statement opposed ta free trade between the
provinces. I was, of course, reading superficially, looking for references to trade, but I
ran through the entire volume without finding a single expression of opinion opposed
to this most beneficent thing, free commercial
intercourse between the provinces.
My friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
said yesterday:
It bas been a cardinal principle in our history
since confederation that trade between the provinces should move freely and unrestricted.

Not only is that so, but we built the canals
of Canada along the St. Lawrence river, past
Niagara Falls, and spent great sums upon
them-at a time when Canada was a poor
country, not the rich country she is todayto the express and simple end that trade
should move more freely from one province
to another and from one municipality to
another. We built the Intercolonial Railway,
largely at government expense-perhaps altogether at governrment expense-in order that
the trade of -the Maritime Provinces should
be enjoyed by the central provinces, and
vice versa. As a concession for their agreeing to come into confederation the Maritime
Provinces required that their trade with the

central part of the country should be facilitated. We built the Canadian Pacifie Railway, at very large expense, in order that
the trade of the eastern part of the country
should move freely to the West, and that the
western provinces should be enabled to ship
their grain to the head of the lakes and on
to the markets of Europe.
And at the present moment we are building air strips hither and yon, at very considerable cost, in order to facilitate the movement of goods and of people. And now many
thousands of our citizens are hoping that in
the course of the next few months arrangements may be made with our great neighbour
to the south for its active support-or, if it
wishes to stand aside, for its consent and
approval-of a further development of the
St. Lawrence water powers and canal system,
so that ocean ships may pass up and down
these waters, carrying goods freely between
the various provinces.
In the light of these economic developments,
in the light of the experience of the nation
to our south, in the light of the absolute logic
which faces us now with regard to our own
confederation and its utter dependence upon
freedom of trade, can you fancy our passing

a statue which is the entering wedge of interference in trade between the provinces? Honourable senators are the older statesmen of

our country, and know something of its history and the basis upon which it operates.
Need there be any doubt in the mind of any
one of us as to how we should vote at this
particular juncture? I grant to otheus the
right to do their own thinking; nevertheless,
I hope that with a striking unanimity this
measure will be passed.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I desire to ask the
honourable senator a question. Did I understand him to say that there are no restrictions
on trading between the various states in the
United States?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is too broad a
question for anyone to answer, but I do not
think there is a positive restriction such as
we have here. The trade restrictions between
the various states are few in relation to the
vast area concerned; however, some states
have secured restrictions, to their own detriment.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I do not see that it
has any bearing on the present discussion, but
I know that it is illegal to ship maragarine
into the State of Oregon.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interject a point
in connection with the so-called restrictions
between the various states in the republic to
the south of us? True, restrictions have been
practised as between states for a long time,

MAY 8, 1952
but they are largely for heaith and sanitary
reasons, rather than for commercial reasons.
Anyone who has had the experience of
motoring through the United States haýs no
doubt been stopped at the bound-aries of
certain states and had his car searched to
make sure that he was not carrying corn,
or some other grain, which was barred from
the state he was entering because of some
infection. The same principle I think applies
to margarine. The ban against it is imposed,
flot for commercial reasonis, but because of
some provisions in the pure food laws of
certain states.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I shouid like to extend my congratulations to
the senator who has just spoken, and also
to the senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
who brought this subject before the bouse.
I take this opportunity to thank the honourabe senator from Toronto-Trinity (H-on. Mr.
Roebuck) for his kind references to the
Newfoundland. senators, and particularly to
my colleague from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird.),
who was flot present in the chamber at the
time. We appreciate the senator's gracious
remarks.
I have reviewed the discussion which took
place last year in the other house on the
legisiation which this bill seeks, to amend,
and I note that the same criticism was expressed'there as has been voiced in this house.
It is notable that a measure of such momentous consequences, was debated for only an
hour or so. Members complained of flrst
having seen the bull when it was placed on
their desks just before tbey rose to speak
to it. Honourable senators had a similar
experience.
I dlaim, as others dîd in the debate hast
year and in their remarks on the bill now
before us, that the Act itsehf contains features which are a denial of federal union
and undermine the basis of confederation.
The federal government bas assumed the
right to set up inter-provincial trade barriers.
Why? Is it to meet the economic needs, real
or imagînary, or the political needs, perhaps
very real, of any particular province or provinces? Regardlless of party no federal goverument, which is ehected to represent ahh provinces, has the rigbt to do that. Let us
assume for a moment that such an enactment
is economicahhy sound for any .provincethough I arn convinced that it is not, and I
shahl endeavour to give some reasons why I
tbink so. Sucb an enactment, or a series of
tbem, would make us a nation of hawbreakers? Is it intended to police the boundaries of the provinces? It just cannot be done,
and no right-tbinking person or government
would for a moment contemplate it. If a haw

is passed and no provision is made for its
adequate enforcement, 1 would, say in, my
simple way that parliament is giving a licence
to haw-breakers. But the matter does not
end there. Disregard for one haw creates
disregard for another, and this process
gathers momentum and keeps rolling on.
The measure passed last year cited the
dairy industry as the one to be affected. It
was an out and out dairy bill, and was so
named. The dairy industry, wbicb is a great
industry, is absolutely vital and essential to
the welfare o! tbe Dominion of Canada, and
shouhd be given every encouragement; but if
the encouragement it receives is restrictive
rather than constructive and progressive it
will do more harm than good.
We are living in a scientific age wben tbe
advantages of science reach down to everyone, whether on the farm, in tbe flsbing
boats or in the forest. Science is producing
great nutritional values from many sources;
it affects ail industries, as it does all peophes.
Margarine bas been injected into this
debate; althougb it has in some instances
been brushed aside, and perbaps righthy so.
I for one arn not going to apologize for mentioning it, alhough admittedly the underlying
prmciphe goes far deeper than and transcends
the importance o! one commodity or industry.
I would, however, hike to deal briefly witb
the economic side of the picture.
Whale oul is produced in Newfoundland
and is used extensively in margarine. Treated
scientiflcally it is pure, wbohesome and ricb
in food value. Why should it, or tbe product
wbich it enters, not flnd a market in otber
provinces, provided tbat government food
standards are met? Those who catch wbahes
are as much entitled to a living as are those
who tend cattie. They are ahh Canadians.
Newfoundhand and Nova Scotia both produce cod hiver oul; in vitamin value it is at
the top of the list but synthetic products
have hargehy taken its place. Shouhd those
two provinces ask the federal govemniment to
put a ban on the interprovincial trade in
competitive products from the haboratory?
Sucb a demand might wehl follow the impiementation of the Canada Dairy Produ-cts Act
Honourable senators, in my opinion the
economics of this wbohe business are wrong,
and a denial of scientiflc achievement.
Mention bas been made by the bonourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) o! the free trading of the fortyeight States o! the Union to the south of us.
That, I think, is one of the greatest object
hessons o! the world. Wbat would bave bappened if the cattle-raisers bad asserted
enough influence to retard the development of

SENATE
cottonseed oil and soy bean oil? At one time
within the memory of most of us, animal
fats were predominant in manufacturing fields
now largely occupied by vegetable oils.
Edible oils from products of other than the
cattle areas in the United States have not
displaced the dairy farmers, but have simply
augmented the supply of oils and fats necessary to meet the needs of the growing population. Cottonseed oil is a principal ingredient of many salad dressings and is also used
in margarine and shortening. The pressings
make the cotton seed cake or meal which provides food for the farm animals, and by-products are used for fertilizer on the farms.
Perhaps some of the cotton bags which our
farmers use for their feeds are another byproduct of the competitive article.
The
advantages of scientific progress encircle us
all.
Again, what would have happened in the
United States and in Canada if the cotton
growers of the south and the sheep raisers
had rebelled against the use of the forests
for rayon and a thousand other articles which
replace to some extent the products of the
cotton belt? The growing population in the
United States needs all these things for
domestic and world trade; and the same
is true of Canada.
Ice cream is mentioned in this bill. Seaweed is coming into use in a large way in
gelatin, candy, pastry and ice cream. Irish
moss, a seaweed, is being used in desserts and
blancmange. There is any amount of unused
products along our coasts. Are our people
who live by the sea to be denied the right
to keep in step with modern science?
The world needs more and more food to
supply the rapidly growing population. Is
Canada or any of its provinces to build a
fence around its borders and say "We are
not interested in any more such developments
of science: we are going to live within ourselves"? It just cannot be done.
Why pick one industry for such restrictive
protection when those engaged in that industry must, in order to live, avail themselves of
other products of scientific research and
development?
The dairy farmers themselves, if there
is a surplus of milk, can find encouragement
from scientific research and development.
As we know, casein made of milk has innumerable uses. Parts of ships and parts of
aeroplanes are stuck together with casein,
and cloth resembling wool is made from it.
I do not want to labour this matter, but I
have enlarged somewhat on this point of
view to illustrate that life in this world has

to be a process of give and take. Such action
as was taken last session by the passing of
the dairy bill as it stands is, to my mind,
retrograde and out of step with the times.
I shall not deal with the constitutional
aspect. Those of the legal profession, who
are more conversant than I with that standpoint, have referred to it, and others will, I
am sure, cover the ground thoroughly.
I am convinced, however, that if this bill
is not adopted, and the existing Act remains
unchanged, the precedent so set will be
remembered as the one which started an
avalanche of similar demands. For instance,
why should not Newfoundland, to protect its
fishermen, exclude salmon from British
Columbia; and why should it admit freely
Prince Edward Island potatoes when our
potato raisers are finding it very hard to
meet the competition? Newfoundland accepts
from the other provinces of Canada ten times
as much as other provinces buy from it.
Furthermore, provincially-owned industries
are not unknown in some provinces. The
precedent of the Dairy Products Act may
usefully be invoked if and when demands for
similar protection are made on the federal
government. I cannot think of a shorter cut
to the destruction of the unity of Canada
than to allow such a measure to remain on
the statute books. If we are going to be
Canadians, let us be Canadians from Cape
Bonavista,
Newfoundland, to Vancouver
Island.
Reference has been made in this debate to
a setting up of ten balkanized provinces. That
implication is quite accurate except that the
number may prove to be wrong. If it is to
be a legal offence, punishable with fine and
imprisonment, for the people of one province
to trade with those of another-and it is distinctly so laid down in the Act-the only
thing wrong with the reference to balkanized
provinces is the number: it is anyone's guess
whether there will be nine, eight, seven, six,
or less. The provinces cannot live to themselves. Unquestionably there will be someand a person does not need to be much of a
prophet to predict that there will be more
than one-that will want to be added to the
number of states to the south of us, where
trading intercourse can be freely carried on.
That will be the cold logic of events if this
vicious system is allowed to run its course.
I am sure -that Canada means too much to
Canadians for that to be permitted to happen.
Apparently the government bas not yet
decided to implement, or at least bas not
implemented, the Canada Dairy Products Act
which was passed last year. It was an illadvised Act, and I hope that parliament will
remove the offending clause by passing the
bill before us.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson presented Bill H-8, an
Act respecting the Criminal Law.
The bill was read the first time.
NOTICE OF SECOND READING TOMORROW

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
a short time ago the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) quite properly called attention to the necessity of adhering to the rule
requiring at least two days notice of a motion
for the second reading of a bill. I quite
agree that this rule should not be waived
unless some excellent reason is advanced for
so doing. For having myself occasionally
lapsed into carelessness with respect to this
rule I apologize to the house, and promise to
try to observe the rule more faithfully in the
future.
Under the circumstances, however, I feel
justified in asking for the unanimous consent
of the house to place this bill on the order
paper for tomorrow. My earlier intention was
to introduce this measure last Thursday and
move second reading tonight, but because of
the delay in receiving printed copies of this
voluminous bill I later decided that when the
bill was introduced tonight I would ask that
it be set down for second reading on Wednesday, which would have been in accordance
with the rules of the house. I am now
informed that the Minister of Justice, who
will explain the bill on second reading, is
unable to be with us on Wednesday or Thursday, but can be here tomorrow. Therefore,
unless the second reading is left over until
Friday, or some time next week, the only
alternative is to ask the leave of the house to
proceed tomorrow.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
as I raised a question the other day on the
observance of the rules of the house, I feel
that I should say a few words at this time.
I am most anxious to hear the minister's
explanation of this bill, and then to have it
considered in committee, where it can be
dealt with clause by clause. I understand
that a great many sections of the law have
not been changed, that many have undergone

minor changes in the wording without-the
revisors say-any alteration of meaning, and
that many more sections have been completely redrafted, with changes in penalties
and so on. This is a measure which, in my
opinion, must be considered clause by clause.
The bill now before us is the result of the
work of a committee under the distinguished
chairmanship of the able Chief Justice of the
province of Saskatchewan, who has worked
on the amendments for some three or four
years. One member of the committee is an
able and experienced criminal lawyer from
the Province of Manitoba, having been for
ten years Crown Prosecutor in the city of
Winnipeg, and later Deputy Attorney General.
I feel that the sooner the bill is explained
on second reading, the earlier it will go to
committee, and the more time we will have
to consider it in detail. I am pleased, therefore, to consent to second reading tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
leader if copies of the bill will be distributed
by tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am quite sure that
the printed copies will be available tomorrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it the wish of the house that the honourable
leader of the government be permitted to
have this measure placed on the Order Paper
for second reading tomorrow?
Sone Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
COMMITTEE
ADDITION TO PERSONNEL

Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move that the

MAY 12, 1952
depend upon my addressing this house. However, there are one or two thoughts which I
wish to leave upon the record, and I know
of no other way of doing so than to speak to
this motion.
I am very anxious that the committee as
proposed should be set up and start to function at as early a date as possible. There
is no question of doubt that at this stage of
the session the time limit is a most important
factor. Every co-operation has been promised; nevertheless, the honourable leader of
the government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) intimated on Thursday last that
time is not elastic, and that the facilities
and services accorded to special committees
take on this characteristic. It is therefore a
matter of real concern to everyone who is
interested in the proposed inquiry, and fear
has been expressed that because of the time
limit the investigation may bog down.
Let me give a definite reassurance on this
point. The unanimity of opinion as to the
need of inquiry leaves no doubt as to the
temper of this house, and that opinion will
prevail. Irrespective of what the time factor at the moment may be, the proposed
committee will hold as many meetings as
soon as possible, and will facilitate the hearing of all possible representations and recommendations from interested individuals and
organizations. Should time and facilities during the present session prove too limited for
the committee to complete its inquiries, or
should the session run over into a fall sitting, I give the solemn undertaking that I
will recommend that the proposed committee reconvene or resume, whichever may be
the proper measure. There is one certain
factor.
It is this: the inquiries raised
through the resolution of Tuesday last will be
prosecuted, not in any anaemic fashion, but
with a relentless energy to a definite and,
I hope, a satisfactory conclusion.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to ask the
honourable senator from Charlotte (Hon. Mr.
Doone) a question. I shall do my utmost to
carry out my duties as a member of this
committee. Realizing the seriousness of the
SALACIOUS AND INDECENT
subject and the amount of work that will be
LITERATURE
involved, I wonder if the honourable gentlePERSONNEL OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE
man has given consideration to whether
"salacious and indecent literature" entirely
Hon. J. J. Hayes Doone moved:
covers the subject matter which he has in

mind? When we get to committee we may
pointed to examine into all phases, circumstances
and conditions relating to the sale and distribution find our inquiry restricted by these four

He said: Honourable senators, I realize to widening the language in order to cover
that the adoption of this motion does not the subject matter he has in mind?

Hon. G. H. Ross: Honourable senators, I
had not intended taking part in this debate,
but after listening to the many interesting
speeches delivered, I felt that I could not
remain silent when so fundamental a principle as the prohibiting of interprovincial
trade was at stake. I feel that we owe
a debt of gratitude to the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) for bringing
the matter up.
The object of the bill before us is to
delete from the Canada Dairy Products Act
of 1951 the powers it confers upon the
government to prohibit the importation from

one province to another of oleomargarinous
and certain other foods other than unadulterated milk.
When the Canada Dairy Products Bill was
before the House of Commons last year, the
Right Honourable Mr. Gardiner said, as
reported in unrevised Hansard, 1951, page
4683:
My understanding is that if any provincial government desires to prevent the manufacture and
sale of oleomargarine within its own province it
had the right to do so.

A state in the United States bas similar
power. (Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S.,
678.)
That being the case, what is the reason
for the legislation? I very much enjoyed the
speech of the honourable senator from St.
John's (Hon. Mr. Baird), who in logical
and eloquent language denounced the vicious
principle of enacting a law prohibiting interprovincial trade. I regret that I was not
present when the Dairy Products Bill came
before the Senate last year. I should have liked
to have the privilege then of voicing my objection to it and voting against it. Apparently

Island are opposed to the importation into
their provinces of oleomargarine. All they

other provinces.

MAY 12, 1952
In the Gold Seal case, 62 S.C.R. 424, three
of the five judges who heard the case in the
Supreme Court of Canada held that the
purpose of section 121 is only to ensure
that articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any province shall not be subjected
to any customs duty or tax when carried into
any other province. It does not apply to trade
generally. Neither of the other two judges
expressed any opinion on this point.
Atlantic Smoke Shops v. Coulon, 1943 A.C.,
550, was decided on the question of whether
or not a tax imposed by New Brunswick on
tobacco was a direct tax within the meaning
of section 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act, and
constitutional. Yet a dictum of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in that case
approved the holding of the Supreme Court
Judges in the Gold Seal case. I do not
think we can very well quarrel with that
holding.
However, I am of the opinion that this
objectionable clause in the Canada Dairy
Products Act is ultra vires. I shall now set
forth my reasons for saying so.
Section 91 of the B.N.A. Act gives parliament legislative authority to regulate trade
and commerce; it does not give authority to
prohibit trade or commerce. Prohibiting trade
is an entirely different matter from regulating
it.
The bonourable senator from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Davis) discussed with clarity and
precision the provision in the constitution of
the United States dealing with commerce, and
the similarity of our constitution to it.
The constitution of the United States provides:
Congress shall have power to regulate commerce
with foreign nations and among the several states.

Section 91 (2) of the B.N.A. Act reads in
part:
. . . the exclusive legislative authority of the
Parliament of Canada extends to ...
(2) the regulation of trade and commerce.

It will be seen that the provisions are very
similar. In 1867 when the Fathers of Confederation were framing the B.N.A. Act they
had before them the constitution of the
United States, and also many cases interpreting the commerce clause in that constitution.
So a reference to United States cases may be
of value in interpreting our constitution.
Although Congress has the power to regulate commerce, that power has been limited
and restricted by the courts to what their
judges refer to as "police power". Police
power is defined in 16 Corpus Juris Secundum, 537, as:
The power inherent in a government to enact
laws. within constitutional limits, to promote the
order, safety, health, morals, and general welfare
of society.

It further states:
The police power is subject to the limitation that
the exercise must be reasonable and for the public
good.

Cooley in his text on Constitutional Limitations, 572, says of the police power:
It embraces . . . those rules of good manners and
good neighbourhood which are calculated to prevent
the conflict of rights and to ensure to each the uninterrupted enjoyment of his own, so far as is
reasonably consistent with the right enjoyment of
rights by others.

The Dairy Products Act cannot be said to
be "consistent with the right enjoyment of
rights by others". It protects the dairymen,
and does not allow poor, needy persons to
have a cheap spread for their bread.
The Supreme Court of the United States
said that the power of Congress to regulate
commerce was never intended to prevent the
states from legislating on all subjects relating
to the health, life, and safety of their citizens,
though the legislation might indirectly affect
the commerce of the country. (Louisville v.
Kentucky, 161 U.S., 701.)
Let me now give you some of the holdings
of the courts in the United States under the
police power.
State quarantine laws, prohibiting the entry
of persons or cargoes which might bring contagious diseases, are constitutional; and the
national government also has jurisdiction in
quarantine to prohibit improper immigrants
and injurious traffic between the states.
(Morgan's v. Board of Health, 118 U.S., 464.)
Again a federal appeal court in the United
States held that under the police power Congress may enact a law forbidding the importation of liquors from one state into another
which prohibits the sale of liquors; but it
cannot prohibit the importation into a state
which does not prohibit the sale. (U.S. v.
Sutton 185 Fed., 253.)
So too, the Supreme Court of the United
States held that Congress has the constitutional power to prohibit the shipment from
one state into another of lumber manufactured by employees whose wages and hours of
employment did not conform to standards
prescribed under the Fair Labour Standards
Act, as one of the purposes of the Act as set
forth in the Act itself is to exclude from
interstate commerce goods produced under
conditions detrimental to the maintenance of
the minimum standards of living necessary
for the health and general well-being.
(U.S. v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100; 132 Am.
L.R. 1430.)
The Supreme Court of the United States has
also held that oleomargarine is a recognized
article of commerce, and cannot be wholly
excluded from importation into one state from

SENATE
another state where it is manufactured,
though the former state may so regulate the
introduction as to insure purity, without having the power totally to exclude it. (Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania 171 U.S., and
Plumley v. Massachusetts 155 U.S. 461.)
This holding is inconsistent with an earlier
judgment of the Supreme Court delivered in
holding that oleomarthe year 1888,
garinous substances other than those produced
from unadulterated milk are within the police
power of the state as being dangerous ta
health. (Powell v. Pennsylvania 127 U.S.,
678.) From what scientists tell us of margarine, no court could very well so hold today.
Hence, Congress or a state may prohibit the
entry into one state of commodities from
another, only if in so doing they are exercising a police power.
Our courts have interpreted our constitution in much the same manner as the courts
in the United States interpret their constitution, by allowing parliament and the provinces
ta interfere with trade and commerce among
the provinces when it is necessary to do so ta
promote the order, safety, health, morals
and general welfare of society. Our Canadian
Courts do not refer ta such legislation as
being an exercise of police power. But
Canada or a province may prohibit interprovincial trade in any product deemed ta be
of a general or injurious nature which should
be abolished. I think this is the principle
the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien), for whose opinion I have the
highest respect, had in mind when he spoke.
I think the court had that principle in mind
when it decided the Prohibition case (1896
A.C., 348), for it spoke of the "liquor evil" and
referred ta the federal law imposing restrictions on interprovincial trade as a safeguard
"against something of a general or injurious
nature ta be abolished or removed."
An examination of the proceedings and
debates of a constitutional convention is a
valuable aid ta the construction of a doubtful
provision. Such an examination should be
entered into much more freely than in interpreting the proceedings of a legislature in
preparing an ordinary statute, as in the former case it is the intent of the people
through their representatives that is sought,
while with a legislature it is the intent of
the representatives themselves that is sought.
As pointed out by the honourable senator for
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), a perusal
of the Confederation Debates should be very
helpful in interpreting "trade and commerce"
in our constitution.
Parliament clearly has the right ta regulate
trade and commerce among the provinces; but
I respectfully submit that neither parliament
nor the legislature of a province has authority

to enact a law prohibiting interprovincial
trade, unless it is necessarily enacted ta promote the order, safety, health, morals or
general welfare of society, or what the courts
of the United States refer ta as the exercise
of police power. I further submit that oleomargarinous foods do not come within that
category.
Consequently, parliament may
regulate, but it has no authority ta prohibit
the interprovincial trade in margarine.
The framers of our constitution intended
that the different provinces should be united
as one nation. Such legislation as the Canada
Dairy Products Act-which I understand has
not yet ýbecome law-will have the effect of
weakening and ultimately destroying the
unity of Canada. I suggest that before it
it proclaimed it should be referred ta the
Supreme Court, so that its validity may be
determined. It is not fair ta expect individuals ta test its validity at their own
expense.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Mr. Speaker, may I rise
on a question of privilege? The last speaker
referred ta me as the senator from St. Boniface, and just the other day another senator
tried ta give me that designation. I draw
ta the attention of honourable senators,
through you Mr. Speaker, the fact that I
am the junior senator for Winnipeg.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I should like ta say just a word in connection with this bill. I was not in the
house last session when the Canada Dairy
Products Bill was considered.
As honourable senators know, I have taken
quite an active stand in the house against
the manufacture and sale of margarine; but
had I been present when that bill was passed
I would have voted against it. It is my
intention ta vote in favour of the bill now
before the house, and I shall state my
reasons for doing so.
I have listened with interest ta the remarks of my honourable friend from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Ross) who has just spoken. True,
there is a great deal ta be said on both sides
of this constitutional question, but that is
a matter for the courts. Unless the case
is an open and shut one, no member of this
Senate should cast his vote on the basis of
his own individual opinion of what the
constitutional question should be. Ta my
mind the problem is a far wider one, namely,
the spirit of the constitution.
I agree with my friend from Calgary that
the measure passed last year providing that
the Dominion shall have the power ta prohibit
the free importation or transportation of certain commodities of trade from one province

as to whether they work along lines similar to
those pursued by the Auditor General of
Canada in preparing his report.
Before doing so, may I refer in a general
way to railway matters as affecting the Maritimes. I was very pleased when, on March 20,
the honourable senator from King's (Hon.
Mr. McDonald) drew attention to the
slight improvements in railway service in
that area and expressed the hope that there
would be further improvements in the train
service between the Maritimes and Montreal.
There are three trains leaving Halifax for
Montreal within a space of seven hours, and
none in the remaining seventeen hours. Conversely, the three trains running from Montreal to Halifax arrive in our city within a
period of five and a half hours, so that for
some eighteen and a half hours there is no
eastbound train service between these cities.
This matter has been repeatedly brought to
the attention of officials of the Atlantic
Region of the railways in the hope that sorne
change for the better would be made; and I
now wish to support the statement of the
honourable senator from King's, and to
express the hope that the leaders of the
government will see fit to place our position
before the Minister of Transport, and that
as a result the service will be improved. I
recall that four years ago, in 1948, I wrote
a letter on this question and asked that the
train service be improved to the extent of
cutting down the running time. I was then
advised that work was proceeding on the
roadbed and that this would result in a more
rapid service.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must draw to the
attention of the honourable senator that he is,
in my opinion, very far from the subjectmatter before the house, which is a bill for
the appointment of auditors of the National
Railways. I listened to his remarks for a
short time, expecting that they would be
brief; but his discussion of railway service
is not relevant to the bill, and I would ask
him to refrain from pursuing it.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you very much, Mr.
Speaker. I had no thought of embarrassing
the leader of the government by any question
on the subject, but I think my remarks have
a direct connection with the duties of the
auditors. I have been wondering whether
they made any worth-while recommendations
such as one finds in the reports of the Auditor
General. That is the point I was leading up
to. I certainly will not go further in that
direction.
Could the leader of the government explain
to us what is represented by the item in the
auditors' report to parliament of $23,347,000

shown as interest due to the government. How
is that amount made up; over what period
does it extend, and what further information
can he give us about it?
I would also like him to turn to page 4 of
the report, which I believe has a direct bearing on the bill, and explain why the sterling
currency rate of exchange is shown at the
former par figure of $4.86g to the pound. That
is how they have shown their assets in so far
as the United Kingdom holdings are concerned. In my opinion we wou-ld have a
truer picture if we took last Friday's rate of
$2.763. In that case the dollar would be
worth about 57 cents, as compared to the rate
which is being shown in their statement. As
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
is well versed in all financial matters and is
capable of dealing with all angles of a
financial statement, a simple question like this
should not be difficult for him to answer.
My third question is the one I mentioned
a moment ago. Do the auditors ever make
recommendations-such as are made by the
Auditor General of Canada-in respect to
measures of savings.
As I am not permitted to speak further at
this time on the matter of improvements to
the railway service between Montreal and
Halifax, perhaps I shall be allowed to pursue
that subject at some future time. I hope
the honourable leader has been able to grasp
the three simple questions I have put to
him and will be able to give us the desired
information.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: While I would not for
a moment admit that I was not in a position
to provide this information, perhaps in the
interests of greater accuracy I might regard
my honourable friend's remarks as a notice
that he intends to ask these questions, and
on some suitable occasion I shall be only
too happy to supply him with the complete
answers.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read a second time.

on was carried on by a committee which was
subsequently appointed a commission, and
was instructed to prepare a draft bill for the
consideration of the government.
The commission, in accordance with their
instructions, prepared the draft bill which I
tabled in the House of Commons along with
their report on April 7, and which my colleague, the honourable government leader in
this house, has tabled in the Senate.
The bill now before you is a redraft of the
commission's draft containing changes in
some minor respects made by the Department of Justice, under instructions of the
government. In the preparation of their
draft bill, the commission had, of course, the
benefit of the work already done, and their
draft bill can be said to give effect in large
measure to the views of all groups engaged
in the work from the time it was commenced
at the beginning of 1949.
The terms under which the commission
were asked to enter upon the last phase of
the work, namely, the preparation of their
draft bill, were as follows:
(a) revise ambiguous and unclear provisions;
(b) adopt uniform language throughout;
(c) eliminate inconsistencies; legal anomalies or defects;
(d) rearrange provisions and Parts;
(e) seek to simplify by omitting and combining provisions;
(f) with the approval of the Statute Revision Commission, omit provisions which
should be transferred to other statutes;
(g) endeavour to make the Code exhaustive
of the criminal law; and
(h) effect such procedural amendments as
are deemed necessary for the speedy and fair
enforcement of the criminal law.
The main principle of this bill which we
are now discussing on second reading, is that
the Criminal Code of 1892, which has been
in existence for 60 years without having had
any major review and overhaul, should now
be revised and consolidated.
The wisdom, and indeed the necessity for
this step are so obvious that I shall not
detain the honourable senators with any
justification of it.
Honourable senators will note that under
the terms of reference the purpose of the
revision was not to effect changes in broad
principles, but was to evolve as simple a Code
as possible by the elimination of unnecessary
or obsolete provisions, the correction of errors
and the removal of inconsistencies, and to
effect such consolidation and rearrangement
as was deemed necessary to facilitate

reference. The work involved was arduous
and required great care. I am sure that
honourable senators will agree that the commission have performed their work in an
admirable way.
The report which was tabled deals with
the number of meetings which were held and
points out certain matters to which the commission felt attention should be drawn. It
is not my intention to review the report of
the commission, but to deal with the bill as
a whole, pointing out general matters as
well 'as certain specific matters which are
thought to be of importance. It is neither
appropriate nor possible for me to deal with
every matter in which there has been change,
so I shall con-fine my remarks to those things
which can be considered of major importance.
I therefore propose to deal with the bill
under the following heads:
(a) Matters of a general nature.
(b) Changes in substantive law.
(c) Procedure:
(1) Indictable offences(i) Extension of jurisdiction of
magistrates;
(ii) Method of election;
(iii) Sentences.
(2) Summary conviction offences(i) Inclusion of more than one
offence in an information;
(ii) Appeal to be on evidence.
Under the general heading I shall deal first
with the matter of rearrangement and conI have pointed out that the

commission were not charged with the task
of making changes in broad principles, but
were asked to evolve as simple a Code as
possible, and in doing so to make such
consolidation and rearrangement as was
thought necessary to the accomplishment of
this end.
Honourable senators will have observed
that there has been considerable consolidation and rearrangement. This phase of the
work has contributed to the marked reduction
in the number of sections in the bill as compared with the number of sections contained
in the present Code. It is obvious that this
feature of the work of the commission will,
prove of great advantage to those who are
called upon to interpret and administer the
criminal law; and as a noteworthy example
of this branch of the work I would direct
the attention of honourable senators to Part
XIX, in which are consolidated all clauses
providing for the calling of witnesses in all
proceedings to which the Act applies.
I would like now to deal with the extent
to which the present bill is exhaustive of the
criminal law.

shall exercise his own judgment, and if the
accused has been guilty on more than one
occasion of the offence charged, he shall take
the fact into account and punish the man
accordingly.
In so far as minimum punishments for first
offences are concerned, the recommendation
of the Commission has not been accepted
in toto by the government. The instances in
the present Code in which a minimum sentence must be imposed on conviction for a
first offence are few in number. Had the
Commissioners retained the principle of minimum punishment, the following offences
would have carried minimum terms in the
bill: or, putting it in another way, the
offences I am now going to name are the
only ones in the present Code for which
minimum terms are provided:

However, in view of the recommendation
the Commissioners, minimum punish-

ments for these offences were not continued
in their draft bill, which is attached as an
appendix to their report.
In the bill now before this chamber
minimum punishments have been restored
in respect of offences relating to the Post
Office and in respect of drunken driving or
driving while ability is impaired. Upon a
purely pragmatic basis we think it is better,
in relation to these specific kinds of offences,
As
to maintain the minimum penalties.
there will be full opportunity for detailed
discussion in committee I will at present
say only this, that while there may be some
merit in the recommendation of the Commission, we think that because of their
deterrent effect, minimum penalties should
not be entirely abolished, and it is for this
reason that we propose they should be
retained in respect of the offences I have
just mentioned.
I should now like to discuss changes
in the substance of law, and in doing
so will attempt to discuss, as one can
appropriately do on second reading, the principles of certain changes in the substantive
law which the Commissioners regarded as
properly part of the task assigned to them.
In accordance with rules I shall confine my
remarks to such principles, and the relevant
sections can be considered in greater detail
when the bill is in committee.

It will be observed that the definition of
treason has been redrawn. The effect of this
revision is, in my view, to place somewhat
greater emphasis on those phases of this
subject which relate to the security of the
state.
In respect of the offences of sedition, the
Commission included in the draft bill which
it submitted a definition of "seditious intention". No doubt the Commission was moved
to do so by reason of the fact that the question
of what constituted a "seditious intention"
had, recently been dealt with by the Supreme
Court of Canada in Boucher v. The King
(1951) S.C.R. 265.
We examined the judgments, of the various
members of the Supreme Court in that case
and we came to the view that it would be
wiser to leave that decision itself to govern
what constitutes a "seditious intention" and
to have the advantage of future judicial pronouncements as to the effect of that judgment before attempting to reconcile and
codify in a few short passages what constitutes
"seditious intention" as laid down in the
reasons for judgment in that case. Sometimes
it is difficult to codify reasons for judgment.
Another change to which I feel I should
at this time direct the attention of honourable
senators is the creation of a new offence
designed to meet those cases of perjury where
it is impossible to determine which of two
sworn inconsistent statements is false. Cases
arise where in preliminary proceedings a
witness will swear to certain facts and
later at the trial will give contrary evidence.
In such cases, there cannot possibly be any
doubt that perjury has been committed, in
respect of one or other of the statements.
However, it is impossible to establish which
statement is false because the person testifying is sometimes the only person who can
establish this. It is to meet situations such as
this that clause 116 of the bill has been
inserted. I would point out that this provision
is confined to testimony on a material issue
and provides safeguards in cases of honest
mistake.
In Part IV of the bill, which is the part
dealing with sexual offences, there is one
matter to which I wish to direct attention,
namely a change made in connection with the
offence of carnal knowledge of girls under
fourteen years of age.
The simplest way of dealing with this
matter would be to quote what is said by the
Commissioners in their Report at page 16 in
dealing with substantive changes:
One example is that under the present code on a
charge of rape or indecent assault, the evidence of
the complainant need not be corroborated. However, a rule of practice requires the trial judge to
give a warning as to the danger of convicting on

MAY 13, 1952
the complainant's evidence alone.
This rule is
codified and extended to cases of carnal knowledge
(clause 134) with the result that under the draft
bill corroboration of the evidence of the complainant is no longer required in cases of carnal
knowledge.

It was rather anomalous that it should be
required in that case and not be required,
for example, in rape.
The next matter I should like to discuss
is that of criminal negligence. The subject of
causing death or bodily harm by criminal negligence is one to which the Commissioners have
paid careful attention and which they have
dealt with at considerable length in their report. There is no purpose in my repeating here
what has been said by the Commissioners in
their report, but I would like to emphasize
that while a new offence bas been created
and a definition of criminal negligence inserted, this effects really no substantive change
in the law but is for the purposes of clarification and to bring the Criminal Code into
accord with judicial interpretation.
I now pass on to clause 365 of the bill. This
provision deals with breaches of contracts,
the result of which will endanger life, deprive
the public of essential services or prevent
the running of passenger or freight trains.
May I, for a moment, touch on the history
of this section. The provision was first
enacted in the Breaches of Contract Act
passed by the Canadian Parliament in 1877.
In introducing the bill, Mr. Blake (later Sir
Edward Blake) said:
The bill did not profess to deal even with a
strike, or to interference with the freedom of the
employee to leave the service of his employer at
any time when his contract expired. It professed
in general terms te say that, save under special

circumstances, breach of service was not a crime.

It professed to define certain breaches of contract,
or in the event of certain breaches of service, when
they involved consequences of such moment and
were connected with such results as might in the
opinion of the government, fairly be called crimes,
to define and punish them as such. To deal with
such a measure was an entirely different question
from such as how to avoid a breach of contract,
or how to treat a riot, how persens obstructing
railway engines were to be treated, how persons
who made murderous assaults, as alleged, were te
be treated, or how the militia of this country was
to te called out in aid of the civil powers.

Under the enactment of 1877, it was an
offence for anyone who was under contract
to provide light or water to a municipality or
who was under contract with anyone who
had agreed to supply such services to
break such contract knowing or having reason
to believe that in doing so the inhabitants
of the municipality would be deprived of light
or water. There was a similar provision
relating to railways.

The provision thus created two offences,
namely,
1. To break a contract to supply services,
and 2. To break a contract with a person who
had agreed to supply services.
Next I wish to deal with the effect of the
1906 revision upon these Statutes. Before I
do so, however, I should point out that the
enactment of 1877 was carried forward into
the Code of 1892, and when certain revisions
of the Statutes were taking place in 1906, the
sections dealing with this type of contract
came under consideration.
In the 1906 revision of the statutes the
wording of the relevant sections was so
changed that while they purported to continue this second offence-that is, the offence
of breaking a contract with a person who had
agreed to supply services-the amended
wording left at least a grave doubt as to
whether they did have that effect. It is to
remove this doubt that the commission have
recommended that clause 365 of the pr.esent
bill be enacted, so as to put the section back
to its original substance, except that it now
contains no reference to the carriage of the
mail.
The Commissioners, in keeping with
Canada's status as an autonomous nation, by
clause 420 give effect to the criminal law in
territorial waters surrounding Canada. This
clause is an adaptation of the provisions of
the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act of
1878. However, in the draft bill as submitted by the commission a limit of twelve
miles was fixed for territorial waters. It
was felt by the department and by the government that this was an undue extension
for the purposes of administration of the
criminal law and that there should be no
departure from what is generally recognized
as the limit of territorial waters under international law, namely, three nautical miles.
We have no doubt that the adoption by the
commission of the twelve-mile limit was for
the purpose of making this bill dealing with
the criminal law uniform with the Customs
Act, which permits search of Canadian vessels
within this limit. But in the administration
of the Customs Act the officials have the
problem of vessels hovering about to commit
a breach of the Act, which is not usually
encountered in the administration of the
criminal law in general, and we do not think
it necessarily follows that because there is a
twelve-mile limit under the Customs Act we
should have the same limit under the criminal
law. We do not think that foreigners and
foreign ships within the twelve-mile limit
should be brought within the purview of the
Criminal Code.

bestowed on qualified persons, the jurisdiction to try an accused with his consent has
been extended to include certain offences
which must now be tried by jury. I would
emphasize that this in no way impairs the
right of an accused to trial by jury and that
the accused will continue to have the right
to select the method of trial which he desires.
New Form of Election:
There has been a change in the form of
election which an accused may make. Under
the code as it now stands, an accused who is
before a Justice of the Peace is given no
election as to method of trial but the Justice
is empowered to hold only a preliminary
hearing. Provision is made in the revision
whereby the Justice, if he decides that a
case for committal is made out, will then
require the accused to elect for trial by a
judge sitting without a jury or by a judge
and jury.
Where an accused is before a magistrate,
he may now elect for trial either before a
magistrate or before a judge and jury. Under
the Bill, the election will be for trial before
either a magistrate, a judge without a jury
or a judge and jury, and he makes his
choice.
Put briefly, the change effected by the
new form of election is that an accused
when in the police court will be given an
opportunity to elect trial by a judge alone
if that is the method of trial he prefers.
I would point out that the right of an
accused who has elected trial by jury to reelect for trial by a judge alone, which now
exists, has been continued-that is to say,
under law as it stands at the present time
an accused who has been committed for
trial may elect trial by jury, but if later on
for one reason or another he desires to
change his election to trial by a judge alone,
he may exercise that right. Under the
amendment such a right of re-election is
maintained.
Sentences:
Under the present Part XVI, which deals
with summary trials by magistrates, of indictable offences, there are special provisions
relating to sentences in respect of those
offences over which a magistrate has absolute
jurisdiction.
Under the revision, these special provisions
have been abolished and the sentences which
may be imposed for these offences will be
the same as those which may be imposed in
any other court.

It was anomalous that a person tried in a
higher court should be subject to a greater
penalty than a person tried by a magistrate
under Part XVI.
Appeal by Attorney General of Canada:
As honourable senators know, prosecutions
under certain Dominion statutes as well as
under the Code are conducted by the Department of Justice by arrangement with the provincial authorities.
That is to say, the
administration of justice-notwithstanding
the designation of the federal Department of
Justice-is a provincial function, but the provisions of certain statutes are enforced by
the federal Department of Justice after first
making arrangements with the provincial
authorities. In such cases, the provincial
authorities take no part in the trial. It was
the view of the commission that in such cases
the Attorney General of Canada should have
the same rights of appeal as those possessed
by provincial Attorneys General and a provision has been inserted to this effect
(clause 601).
Summary Convictions:
The principal matters to which I wish to
direct attention in respect of changes in procedure in summary conviction offences are
the following:
(a) Inclusion of more than one offence in
an information. Under the Bill, provision is
made for the inclusion of more than one
offence in an information. This is not an
innovation. Similar provision will be found
in both dominion and provincial Acts and the
practice was widely adopted in connection
with wartime regulations. As a proper safeguard, it will be noted that power is given
the court to order a separate trial on any one
or more of the included charges if the court
is of opinion that such a course is necessary
in the interest of justice.
(b) Appeal to be on Evidence. Under the
present provisions of the Code where an
appeal is taken in a summary conviction
matter, the court must hold a new trial or as
the lawyer calls it a tria1 de novo. The
practice has grown up among certain shrewd
lawyers of not putting in any evidence for the
defence at a first trial; then being familiar
with the Crown's case, an appeal is launched
and the case is tried de novo. Having heard
the Crown's case such a lawyer is in a position to bring in his evidence, and it is sometimes thought that acquittals are so won
which are not warranted.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Disgraceful.
Hon. Mr. Garson: The commissioners have
recommended that in future the appeal should
be determined on the evidence taken in the

SENATE
court of first instance as in the case of
more serious indictable offences. In order
that the court will have before it all essential evidence, authority is given to hear additional witnesses as well as witnesses called
on the trial. It would appear that this is
a proper change as it seems an unnecessary
duplication to have witnesses called to give
the same evidence on two separate occasions in respect of the same issue.
Before leaving this branch of the bill, I
should point out that the summary trials
part and the part relating to summary conviction offences were submitted to provincial
representatives at a joint meeting held in
Toronto in September last. These parts were
discussed section by section, and the commission in its report points out that in general the revision of these parts was acceptable
to the provincial representatives.
In closing, there is one general observation
I would like to make. In opening I pointed
out that the revision was not undertaken
for the purpose of effecting changes in broad
principles. Our system of criminal jurisprudence embodying as it does the high principles of the British system provides as fair
and just a system as it is possible to devise
to ensure that justice will be accorded to
all. I am sure that those who have studied
the Bill will agree that the Commission in
its work, and the bill now before you, honourable senators, have maintained those principles.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
it is not my intention to adjourn the debate.
I have had the good fortune to have an
opportunity to read the memoranda which the
commissioners sent with their bill, and the
Honourable Minister of Justice has commented
extensively on that information.
I propose to repeat somewhat my remarks
of last night, in that I think there is nothing to
be gained by a long discussion on the bill
in this house. It is a type of measure that
is better handled in committee, where honourable senators may have a free and frank
discussion of its provisions. The memoranda
accompanying the bill give a very clear exposition of what is intended by the amendments. I did not have to attend the Divorce
Committee this morning, so I spent a good
deal of time going over the material before us.
I checked up on some of the changes and, with
respect, I say to the honourable minister
that I am not sure that I agree with his
views. But as I am not an outstanding
lawyer, it may well be that the commission
is right and I am wrong.
To study the bill in committee would help
us to understand it better: each clause could

be considered 'by itself as we went along:
most of the sections would be read and
passed without debate. I do not markedly
disagree with the Minister of Justice. This is
not the first time that I have sat with the
honourable gentleman in a legislative assembly. For eight years we occupied seats opposite each other in another place, so that his
voice and manner are not unfamiliar to me. I
offer him my congratulations; personally I
am delighted to see him here.
I would not withhold for some poor fellow
accused of an offence the right to a trial
de nove if he has been before a certain magistrate or in certain courts. From my experience with some magistrates, and with due
respect to them, I would say that were I
charged with an offence, I would rather take
my chances in a higher court than before
then in the court below. However, that is
a detail. My point is that the house should
send this bill to committee in order to understand it better.
The minister made a. very fine presentation
this afternoon. Although myself a lawyer of
sorts, it kept me busy to follow all the changes
he proposes, and I think it must have been
very difficult for laymen to understand the
significance of them all. I shall not repeat what
I said yesterday, but if a certain gentlemanthe minister knows to whom I refer-or
someone as well qualified were available to
the committee, we would gain a much clearer
understanding of this bill. The man I have
in mind is really experienced in this matter.
One cannot serve ten years in a city police
court without getting a pretty good idea of
the ramifications of the criminal law. So I
suggest that he be allowed to meet the committee; then we can have a discussion, and
when the bill is reported, to the house all of
us will have a better understanding of it. Further, if I am not in agreement with some decision of the committee, I want to be free on
third reading te raise such objections as I
see fit. By voting today for second reading
of the bill I am not to be understood as
confirming it. I think that all of us need
more information, and that a better job can
be done in committee.
I thank the minister for his references
te the Bankruptcy Act. He might also have
mentioned the income tax law, on which some
of us have very definite opinions.
In conclusion, I am persuaded that if we
do a good job in connection with the present
bill, members of the House of Commons, no
matter how they may talk about the Senate
when they are away from Parliament Hill,
when inside this building will admit that we
are a pretty fine class of people.

MAY 13, 1952
Hon. Thomas Reid: May I be permitted
ta ask the minister a question? During his
speech he said something about territorial
waters and the jurisdiction relating thereto.
He spoke of the twelve-mile lirait as it
relates ta customs law enforcement, and also
referred to the three-mile limit. In view
of the fact that international law knows
nothing of the three-mile limit, or territorial
waters, has the commission given consideration ta the idea of extending aur territorial
waters and so protecting aur fisheries?
Hon. Mr. Garson: Honourable senatars, I
think the answer is, that what is meant by
"territorial waters" is determined ta a considerable extent by the subi ect-matter with
which yau are linking it. Let me take as
an example, in order ta make my explanatian
as brie! as passible, the criminal laws of
the United States and of ail the variaus members of the British Commonwealth retain
thýis three-mile limit. When you get into
customs administration you must have regard
ta the fact that you are dealing with a new
set af practical problems, problems af vessels havering off the coast, waiting until
darkness f ails in order tai start their criminal
activities; and the same sort af practical
problems arise when you are dealing with
questions af fisheries. One of the most recent
judgments af the International Court at the
Hague had ta do with the question of Norwegian territorial waters. The report is not
yet available, but an article upon it has been
written by Professor Lauterpacht, a member
of the staff of one of the British universities,
wha has analysed and summarised this judgment. One has only ta read his article ta see
that the judgment deals with the question of
territorial waters in connection with an
entirely different matter, namely Norwegian
fisheries, wherein the conformation af their
coastline and their fiords, the places in the
ocean where fish are ta be found, and similar
consideratians play their part, and the law
in such a case is not a very satisfactory guide
to what we should enact in aur Canadian
Criminal Code. Sa far as the disposition
of the matter bef are us is cancerned, it
relates only ta the criminal law. One of the
problems with which. we had ta, cancern
ourselves was the cansequences of asserting
jurisdictian over a fareign ship within the
twelve-mile but beyond the three-mile limit.
Supposing it is a Norwegian ship, with a
Norwegian captain and crew, sailing under the
Norweglan fiag: are we ta say that it is the
responsibility of the Mounted Police or any
other Canadian police or af the Canadian courts, if a murder is committed
on that ship while it is within those
nmne miles
of water,
ta, bring the
murderer ta justice? I do not think
55708-16ô

we would want ta do that. If we have
enlarged aur jurisdiction in connectian with
fisheries or customs, the only reason is in
arder ta deal with the practical prablems
which arise in relation ta bath these matters.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I ask the honourable
minister a question, as unfortunately I was
not here during the whole of his speech.
Did he deal with the question of a new
definition of criminal negligence?
Han. Mr. Garson: Yes.
Han. Mr. Hayden: By what process of logic
and reasaning bas he finally evolved the
present definition?
Han. Mr. Garsan: Well, honourable senators, 1 cannot plead guilty ta having defined
it. It was defined by the commission, and
after consideration of their commission we
adopted it, and I think it can be defended.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As I read clause 191,
Mr. Minister, it purports ta define criminal
negligence as follows:(1) Everyone is criminally negligent who shows
a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of Cther persons
(a) by doing anythlng, or
(b) by omitting to, do anything that it is his
duty to do.
(2) For the purposes of this section, "duty"
means
(a) s dutyr impased by law, or
(b) a duty for the breach of which a persan
may be found liable in civil praceedings.

It strikes me that if I am required ta do
something on the civil side of the law, and
I fail ta do it, and I can be sued for damages,
that would appear ta be made one o! the
elements in the constitution of "criminal
negligence"l as defined in section 191. Naw,
is that intended?
Hon. Mr. Garson: I think it would help
if I were ta repeat what I said on this subject when my honourable friend was nat;
present. It was this: The subi ect o! causing
death or badily harm. by criminal negligence
iýs one ta which the commissioners have paid
careful attention and which they have dealt
with at considerable length in their report.
There is no purpose in my repeating here
what has been said by the commissioners in
their report, but I would like ta emphasizeand I think this answers my honourable
!riend's question-that while a new offence
has been created and a definition of criminal
negligence inserted, this effects really no
substantive change la the law but is for the
purpases of clarification and ta bring the
Criminal Code into accord with judtcal
interpretatian.

In other words, if the vlew o! the commission and o! the Department af Justice is
right, and I think it is, we have done nothing
more in this than ta state what is now

SENATE
established as the law by our jurisprudence;
in other words, to codify the legal decisions
upon this point. I think that will become
apparent when it is discussed in detail in
committee. If my honourable friend wanted
to go into it we could supply the whole list
of decisions which brought us to this
conclusion.
With reference to the specific question as
to whether the mere breach of a duty in
itself would constitute criminal negligence, I
would be very much surprised if there are
any decisions to that effect, or if the proper
interpretation of the section which the honourable senator has read is to that effect. As
I have always understood, and I am sure
my honourable friend agrees with me, the
breach of a duty imposed is negligence; but
whether coupled with all of the other circumstances in the case it proves a wanton and
criminal negligence is a question of fact, to be
determined upon the facts of the case before
the court. I think that is the only answer I
can give to my honourable friend at this
time. I do not altogether agree with his
point but it is properly taken, and I would
be glad to go into it in committee.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not quarrelling
with your statement of the law, but I am
wondering whether section 191 is drafted in a
way which reflects that.
Hon. Mr. Garson: It is thought by the commission that it does that, and by our departmental and parliamentary draftsmen, to
whom my honourable friend the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) was referring in
such glowing terms a few moments ago. It
is possible that they may be wrong, and if
they are, we could correct this in committee.
One of the reasons this matter is being considered by the Senate is that this body can
make corrections of that sort.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Do I understand the
honourable gentleman to say that he will
be available at our committee meetings?
Hon. Mr. Garson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Are the sections that
are new so marked for study purposes?
Hon. Mr. Garson: We shall have, for the
purposes of the committee, a list of all the
sections which have been discontinued and
dropped, all those in respect of which substantive changes have been made, all of
those which have been changed as to wording without change as to substance, and all
of those which are carried into the new bill
in their identical form. By using these means
one can move right through the bill and
know exactly what has happened to every
section in the present law.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I wish to join with the leader

opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) in thanking my
colleague, the Minister of Justice (Hon. Mr.
Garson) for having given us such an interesting exposition of this bill on the motion
for second reading. Of course, my prime
object in life is to expedite the passing of
legislation. I suppose, therefore, I should
welcome the suggestion made by the honourable leader opposite, that second reading
be given to this measure today. At the
same time I should point out that one honourable senator who was unable to attend
today was assured that this legislation would
not be given second reading this afternoon.
I do not know whether this honourable
gentleman, who has always taken an active
interest in matters of this kind, may wish
to say something on the second reading
or not, but in fairness to him I would be
reluctant to have the debate closed at this
time. Unfortunately I was unable to supply
copies of this bill before honourable senators came to the chamber today.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Will we have copies
tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There are twenty
copies available now, and I think additional
ones will come to us progressively. It is
merely a question of getting them printed,
and I shall certainly see that members get
them as soon as possible. In case any honourable senator decides to speak on the second reading of the bill, I am going to suggest to my deputy whip that he adjourn the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
as I stated last night, I shall not be in a
position to take part in this debate before
tomorrow at the earliest. I have been desirous of consulting my colleagues about the
matter, but there has been no meeting of
the government for the last few days, and
at present the Prime Minister is away. I
hope, however, to have a consultation tomorrow and to make my little contribution to
the debate in the afternoon. I therefore ask
that the order stand.

Honourable senators will observe that there
is no authority given to the commissioners to
change the criminal law as such or to provide the Dominion of Canada with a new
criminal law. Only the expression of the
law is under review. That is a matter of great
detail.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Mr. Speaker, I should like
to rise on a point of order. I have asked for
a copy of the bill now being discussed and
have not received one. I do not know why
we allow bills to be discussed in this house
before copies have been distributed.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would point out
to the honourable senator that it is with the
leave of the Senate that the debate is proceeding when only a limited number of
copies have been distributed. I understand
that the consent of the house given to proceed
yesterday continues today.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Mr. Speaker, on the point
of order. It is quite correct to say that leave
was given to proceed with the debate on
second reading yesterday in order to enable
the Minister to explain the bill; however, it
does not follow that we should continue
to debate today without every senator having
a copy of the measure before him, as required
by the rules of the house. Further, inasmuch
as there is a report of the commissioners
available, that report also should be in the
hands of honourable senators. It is not
possible to follow intelligently what is being
said in this debate without the measure being
I very strongly support the

honourable senator's point of order.
On the remarks made by Your Honour, I
would suggest that extending the consent
of the house to allow the continuation of the
debate today would be going beyond our
understanding of what happened yesterday
when the minister had leave to explain the
bill. I do not believe that could be construed as consent to the debate continuing
without copies of the bill having been distributed.
The Hon. the Speaker: In answer to the
observations of the honourable senator, I may
say that leave of the Senate was given, and
at first it seemed that second reading would
take place yesterday. However at the end
of the sitting the honourable leader of the
government did not insist on second reading

because he felt that all honourable members
should have an opportunity of speaking to
the measure. That is why I conclude that
the consent of the house given for yesterday
is still in effect.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Mr. Speaker, I of course
do not want to appeal from Your Honour's
decision, but I feel that the honourable
leader would be well advised not to insist
on proceeding with the debate today, but
to allow it to stand until Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
let me say that I have no objection at all
to suspending what I have to say until later,
if the Senate so decrees.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I interject a
remark at this juncture, lest anything my
honourable friend has said as to my insisting
on the debate being proceeded with today be
misunderstood. That is quite contrary to the
fact: I intervened yesterday to prevent the
bill from receiving second reading, though all
honourable senators present were apparently
agreeable ta such a step being taken. I said
at the outset of the sitting that only twenty
copies of the bill were available. I had
hoped that by today more copies would be
on hand, but I am now advised that they will
not reach us until tomorrow morning.
Entrusted as I am with the responsibility
of the leadership of the house, I am interested
in seeing the legislation proceed as rapidly
and conveniently as possible, and rather than
postpone this measure until next week, when
another substantial revision is to come before
us, I think we should proceed tomorrow,
when the senator from Toronto-Trinity can
conclude his remarks. If it is desired that
my honourable friend continue at this time,
that would be quite acceptable to me. But
I think we should proceed with the discussion tomorrow, and Friday if necessary, in
order to get the bill into committee as rapidly
as possible. Certainly I am not urging that
it be dealt with until copies are in the hands
of every honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, I
want to support His Honour the Speaker in
the stand he takes. The house consented,
upon the understanding mentioned, to proceed
with debate on the second reading, and that
consent will stand until the motion for second
reading has been put. Like the honourable
government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) I
am not only willing but delighted that everybody shall have an opportunity to be heard.
Of course, as my honourable friend from
Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) was not here yesterday, he had no opportunity of knowing
the facts.

MAY 14, 1952
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I did flot ask to be heard.
I asked to bave a copy of the bill. Without
it, should we be expected to agree to second
reading?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Unfortunately, my bonourable friend was flot here. Had bie been here
he could have objected, but in this house one
cannot object in absentia. I support the
stand of the honourable the Speaker. My
understanding is that the consent ran to the
second reading, but that after second reading
copies of the bill must bé in our hands or a
new consent will be required.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
seems to me that the suggestion of our colleague from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol) is a
very reasonable one. We went ahead yesterday with the consideration of second reading
for a special reason, namely, that we were
told that the Minister of Justice, whom it was
desired-quite rightly-shouid corne before us
to explain the measure, would not be able to
attend later this week. We therefore waived
the ordinary requirement that when second
reading of a bill is moved copies of the bil]
should be before us. But I do not think that
that agreement was intended to continue
indefinitely.
I confess I do not know very much about
the Code. I listened yesterday to a very
interesting exposition of the legisiation.
Apparently there is attached to it a memorandum. in which the commission entrusted with
the revision explains its reasons for the proposais. I think we should have at least some
opportunity of looking over that document
and the text of the bil before we get into a
general discussion.
My honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity <Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
wlll, I have no doubt, make a very useful contribution 'to the debate. Others also may do
so. As far as I am concerned I amn in comnplete ignorance, except in a very general way,
of what we are talking about; and I would
suggest that this discussion be held over until
we have had an opportunity of familiarizing
ourselves with the bull and the memorandum
that accompanies it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I understand it, the
stand-an entirely reasonable one-taken by
the honourable senator from Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Nicol) is that he is not in a position to
even hear a debate until the bill is before
him; and in view of what bas been said by
the honourable member for Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and by the leader, I move the
adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

0F COMMISSION'S

REPORT

Han. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
as I said before, I have no desire to have
the discussion on second reading curtailed
or to have it carried on without the fullest
facilities. What 1 said about the availabilty
of copies of the bill tomorrow is in accordance with my best information. If copies
are not ready by then, I shail have to act
accordingly.
One point bas been brought to my attention by the Assistant Clerk. What 1 said
referred to the bull itself. I amn advised that
no more copies of the report of the Commission are obtainable. Consequently, with
leave of the Senate, I move that the
Commission's report be printed as an appendix to our Official Report of Debates, s0
that it will be available to anyone who would
like to see it
Han. Mr. Davis: I assume that the motion
of the bonourable member from TorontoTrinity, (Hion. Mr. Roebuck) to adjourn the
debate will protect hlm in bis right to speak
again.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: He adjourned the debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson was
agreed to.
CANADA

DAIRY

PRODUOTS

BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed frorn Monday, May
12,' the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bull B, an Act to amend the Canada Dairy
Products Act.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, on several occasions I have moved
the adjourrnment of this very interesting
debate, chiefly for the reason that, aside
from any opinions of my own, it is my duty
to reflect as far as possible the views of my
colleagues in the government. The question
raised is an important one, because it involves legisiation which 1 introduced in the
first session of last year.
1 cornmunicated to my colleagues the interest wbich has been aroused in this matter,
and took occasion to, emphasize my feeling of
inability to deal with the great variety of
questions raised both as to, matters of policy
and to legal aspects, as fu]ly and satisfactorily
as the bouse migbt reasonably expect. This
handicap is not a new one so far as I amn concerned, and I do not doubt that it will be
evidenced from time to time in future.
Although at times I have called upon some

SENATE
of my very able colleagues to explain legislation to this house, I remember saying during the debate on a resolution of mine respecting the Senate, that it amazed me that
a group of 102 legislators of the eminence of
the members of this body had so long suffered a situation to continue wherein they
got only as much official information as was
available from one poor lone individual, why
a bouse of over one hundred legislators should
be willing to depend on a system whereby
all information is conveyed to it by one individual-in contrast with the other place,
where there are twenty ministers and twelve
parliamentary secretaries-is beyond my
comprehension.
However, I did not institute the system;
it was here long before I came to this
chamber. Consequently I should like to see
the Minister of Agriculture and the law
officers of the Crown in a position to take part
in this serious discussion. Therefore, speaking
as a member of the government, I shall not
oppose the second reading of the bill, but
I must of necessity, of course, reserve the
right to reflect whatever may be the viewpoint
the government takes after the matter has
been considered in committee.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I have nothing to say about the
point raised by the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), but I do want to express my
position with reference to this amendment
before second reading is given to the bill.
I have no alternative but to support the proposed amendment. I was one of those who
opposed the Canada Dairy Products Bill when
it was before the house last year, and I was
also one of the few who remained to vote
against it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: If I remember correctly,
it was a Saturday morning; but I can say
with some comfort that the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) was
also here to vote against the measure. The
point is that the bill did not reach the Senate
until the last days of the session. Before
coming to us it had received scant attention
in the other place, the discussion there being
represented by only a page and a half in
Hansard. In other words, in the rush to
finish the session last year, the Canada Dairy
Products Bill received practically no attention from parliament. It is largely because
of this fact that I want to express my position
today as being favourable to having the
Canada Dairy Products Act amended so as to
permit the freest sort of trade relations
amongst our provinces.

There is one point that occurs to me now
which could not be applied last year. Unfortunate and dire circumstances in connection
with the livestock industry in Western Canada
have led to the placing of embargoes by the
provinces, one against the other, in the matter of the shipment of beef cattle outside
of certain areas. I realize that these embargoes result from an emergency arising out
of health conditions; but I strongly submit
that the conflict of the principle in connection with these circumstances and the principle underlying the Canada Dairy Industry
Bill of last year is very plain indeed. As
was explained by the Minister of Agriculture,
in the present circumstances several provinces
have set up embargoes-which are not considered to be in the best interests of the
dominion as a whole-against the entry of a
certain product of another province. As a
result of representations made by the minister, the embargo into British Columbia was
modified and, I think, removed for a time.
The point is that whereas a year ago it was
considered to be in the interests of the federal
structure to have the right to prohibit the
interchange of trade in dairy products, it is
today not considered to be in the interests
of the provinces that they have that freedom.
It is simply because the provinces are acting
on their own and not through any invocation
of a federal law. I submit that the position
suggests a certain conflict in principle which
brings out a claim that bas been soundly made,
namely, that where the interchange of commerce from one part of Canada to another is
concerned, the federal measuring rod should
prevail, and the authority should lie there.
Honourable senators, because I am in agreement with all that has been said against the
isolationist point of view that bas been
developing in Canada at a time when we are
trying to promote to the utmost a spirit of
international co-operation in trade, I cannot
do otherwise than re-emphasize the position
I took a year ago, and support this amendment.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
shall not delay you long. When the Canada
Dairy Products Bill was before the house
last year I took the strongest exception to
to section 6 of that bill. At this time I merely
want to reiterate what I said on that occasion.
I feel that the principle involved is most
The government did not enact

prohibition, but they took steps so that
from time to time, by order in council, they
might interfere with the natural flow of trade
in natural products in Canada. That is a most
dangerous principle and one that will become,

MAY 14, 1952
if it remains on the statute books, very embarrassing to this and any succeeding government. If a certain group interested in a
particular product in this country can secure
legislation of this kind, there is no end to
the prohibitions that may be sought by various people in this country. As I have said,
it is a very dangerous and a very wrong
principle.
The senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has referred to the recent prohibition
by some provinces of the importation within
their boundaries of cattle from disease-infected areas in the West. I think that he will
find in the Quarantine Act provisions applying to situations of this kind. We know that
an individual who has contracted an infectious disease can be and is quarantined, and
is not allowed to travel on our trains or
vessels. I think that under that law an
embargo may be placed on the movement
of animals that might carry disease from one
part of the country to another.
As one who has had some experience and
been in parliament a long while, I wish to
express again very clearly the opinion that
unless there is a repeal of that part of last
year's Act which empowers the government
to prohibit by Order in Council the flow of
natural products within Canada, it will really
strike at the roots of confederation. Therefore I think that part of the Act should be
repealed.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
up until today I did not intend to take any
part in this debate. I am ashamed for not
having been here a year ago when the vote
was taken on the Canada Dairy Products Bill.
I waited and waited for the bill to come
over from another place, but it did not
reach here until the last days of the session,
and before it came to a vote I had left for
home. I had had accommodation on the
train reserved for some time, and if I had
not used it then I should have had to wait
over here several days longer in order to
get another reservation. Of course, I really
did not think that the bill would pass, but
apparently a thing of this kind does get
through once in a while.
I listened with a good deal of interest to
the senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt). He does not want any interference
with conditions in his province. I also
listened with much interest to the senator
from Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour), and I believe
I understand the difficulty that faces him.
One can have some light thrown on what is
in the minds of these honourable gentlemen
by looking back at their actions on former
occasions. Apparently they both have some
fear that if the present section 6 of the

Canada Dairy Products Act is repealed
oleomargarine will be shipped into the
provinces of Quebec and Prince Edward
Island and affect the dairy industry in those
provinces.
Now, I am not boasting-for if I were to
boast about this the people of Winnipeg would
murder me-but the fact is that I have never
voted in favour of oleomargarine. I spoke
on the matter only once, and at that time I
spoke in favour of it. But oleomargarine is
not the issue here at all. Canada is a country
of ten provinces. It is a great country, and
we are very proud of it. The whole ten provinces are required to make up the country.
I know that the people from my part of
Canada-Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta
and British Columbia-are just as anxious
that Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Ontario,
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland should prosper as that the western
provinces themselves should do so. And we
in the West do not believe that Canada can
prosper as it should unless there is the maximum freedom of trade between every part
of the country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In my part of the country
we do not stand for any barriers between
different provinces. I may say to the senator
from Kootenay-East (Hon. Mr. King) that we
all regret that British Columbia, Manitoba
and Quebec have recently had to place an
embargo against cattle from certain parts of
the West. But to realize how serious it is for
us in Manitoba you only have to remember
that less than 200 miles away from where I
live is an area where cattle are afflicted with
a disease that spreads very easily. Normally
cattle from those parts are shipped into our
stockyards by the hundreds, and if the
diseased animals were allowed to enter they
would place our province in very great
danger. As the senator from Kootenay-East
properly said, quarantine regulations are at
times essential. Suppose an epidemic of
smallpox broke out in the city of Winnipeg.
Would you want me to come down here to
Ottawa or Toronto at that time? No. You
would tell me and all other people of Winnipeg that we should stay home until the
epidemic was over. If there was an outbreak in Toronto, I would be the first one
to vote to prohibit people travelling from
Toronto to Manitoba.
This is a business matter. Undoubtedly
the Fathers of Confederation intended that
every part of Canada should trade freely with
every other part. I have on my feet a pair
of shoes that were made in the province of
Quebec. Now, we have shoe factories in Winnipeg. If the principle of the Dairy Products

SENATE
Act were to be generally applied, the people
of Manitoba could demand an embargo on
the importation of shoes into their province
from Quebec or New Brunswick or any other
province. That is what this Act means. And
that kind of thing can be done by any province if it has a sufficient number of members
in the other house to force the matter. You
may say to me that in the next parliament
Manitoba will have only fourteen members
in the House of Commons and they could not
exercise much influence. But I have been
in the Senate when the House of Commons
was controlled by less than fourteen members.
Hon. Mr. King: Three.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Maybe three, yes. So it can
be done. It would be quite possible for a
government in power, needing some votes for
a certain thing, to say to the representatives
from Manitoba: "If you will deliver us your
votes on this question we will see that you
can get through a bill to prohibit the importation into Manitoba of shoes from any other
province, and that will be a good thing for
your factories."
Now, I do not pretend to be a very able
lawyer, but I believe that under section 121
of the British North America Act the government could prohibit importation into any
province from another province of any of
the products mentioned in the Dairy Products Act. Eminent lawyers here-such as
my friends from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Vancouver-South (Hon. Mr. Farris), Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), and De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien)-may say that I am
wrong on this, but I really believe that the
Dairy Products Act is constitutional. However,
that is not the issue at all.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The issue is whether we
want to maintain freedom of trade between
the provinces. We here as senators represent,
we think-and I trust that we do representthe best thought in Canada. We should put
the best interests of Canada before anything
else, and should be determined that every
part of the country shall have an equal
opportunity to trade with every other part of
the country. For that reason I intend to
vote for the bill before us, for on that ground
I do not believe that the present Dairy Products Act can be defended. I can understand
how political considerations might influence
honourable members of another place to do
certain things, but the Senate has no right
to exist if we allow political considerations to
influence our vote.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: We would. serve no purpose
at all if we were influenced by political considerations, or were simply a rubber stamp
for another place. I am not suggesting that
anyone here has ever acted as a rubber stamp
or that the Senate itself has ever done so. My
search of the records shows me that the
Senate has made the strongest resistance to
government legislation when the majority in
the Senate bas been of the same political
stripe as the party in power. Just consider
what this house did with the Crowsnest Pass
Bill. The Senate's action on that measure
was one of the best things it ever did.
For the reasons stated I intend to vote for
the second reading of the bill. If the leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) wishes to refer it to
a committee, I shall have no objection whatever to that. If he moves for reference to
a committee, I shall vote for the motion,
for I am one of those who believe that if your
cause is right no publicity can harm it; that,
on the contrary, the more publicity it gets
the better your cause will stand out. And
so convinced am I of the justice of this bill
that I have no fear of what will happen to it
in committee.
Hon. Sal±er A. Hayden: Honourable senators, the seriousness of this situation in
dealing with this type of legislation that we
are now trying to get at through the consideration of this bill lies, so far as I am
concerned, only in the fact that I must reach
the conclusion that the federal authority bas
the constitutional right to enact such legislation, which involves prohibition in the field
of inter-provincial trade. I am not predicting
what may happen in the future should this
question be referred to the Supreme Court
of Canada-now our court of final resortbut under the law as it now stands, we have
a decision of that court, written by some
very able jurists, which holds in respect of
section 121 of the British North America Act
that the use of the word "free" in its relation
to the movement of trade between provinces
means free of customs duties, and that the
broad meaning, which you and I might
envisage and use, is limited by judicial interpretation. Beyond that, there is a subsequent
decision of the Privy Council which in the
reasons for judgment acknowledges the correctness of the decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in the previous case. But
I repeat that as far as I am concerned the
seriousness of the situation is emphasized
and underlined by the fact that the federal
authority possesses such power of prohibition,
and frankly, I do not believe in prohibition of
any kind.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

MAY 14, 1952

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think that when prohibitions come into force there should be
some basic reason for them which relates to
the safety, health or welfare of the nation as
a whole. I do not think that prohibitions
should operate on any basis of relationship
as between one province and another. For
instance, because a commodity is produced in
two provinces, one of which has a greater
capacity than the other and might swamp its
product, is no justification for prohibiting the
movement of that commodity, whatever it
may be, from the province of larger capacity
to the province with perhaps a smaller
market. The motive for prohibition should,
in my opinion, be national in its scope. I
think the application of a prohibition should
extend to the food and drug law, and relate
to the health of the people of Canada as a
whole.
In the consideration of this measure I am
not looking at the particular prohibition
decreed by the Canada Dairy Products Act,
but rather at the principle involved in its
application today to substitutes for dairy
products; tomorrow legislation may be presented which affects boots and shoes. It is
possible that at some time the federal authority might be used for the purpose of adjusting
prices up or down and controlling the flow of
commodities at the will of the majority who
then happen to be in the Parliament of
Canada.
I think the Senate should attempt to define
some principle to be followed in applying
prohibitions with respect to interprovinciâl
relations. The principle would be sound if it
were based on the factors which I have mentioned, and did not apply to named products
or articles of trade. As the senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has said,
although such a prohibition as we are now
considering may not be contrary to the British
North America Act as thus far interpreted in
the courts, it is certainly contrary to the
thoughts that were in the minds of the
Fathers of Confederation, and against the
objects they had in view in bringing these
individual units into a federal union.
It is for this reason that 1 think we should
emphasize our position at this time, and point
out that a prohibition in relation to interprovincial trade is not sound in principle
when the government purports to exercise an
undoubted authority which it possesses, and
that a definite principle should prescribe that
prohibitions will only be used in the national
interest as a whole.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to speak at any great
length.

The trend of the debate today--especially
the remarks of my friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden)-has satisfied me that the
federal parliament has a right to avail itself
of such legislation as the Canada Dairy Products Act.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The bill upon which
that Act was based came before this house in
the dying days of the last session. I took the
stand then that the leader himself was not
in a position to give the measure the explanation it deserved, because he did not have
time to gather the material and the debate
in the other house had been very short. At
that time I asked my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) to extend his
generosity and allow the bill to go before
a committee where both sides of the question
could be discussed, and then on the motion
for third reading the house, if it wished,
could vote down the bill.
My understanding is that a vote for second
reading is a vote for the approval of the
principle of a measure. I have no objection
to approving of the principle of my friend's
bill, but I certainly want to find out from
the minister and the officials of the department why the Act bas not been proclaimed.
Do they want it continued on the statute
books, or should it be amended to remove
its many objectionable features which have
been pointed in the current debate in this
house? In my opinion the measure before us
should be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce. That committee
is composed. of fifty members-a large percentage of the senators today-and it could
thoroughly scrutinize the measure.
Some honourable senators have claimed
that the measure passed last session was
considered in their absence. Well, that is
not my fault. I was here last session, as I
am every session, almost to the last day. My
friends are resorting to a feeble excuse.
I am going to ask that this bill be considered in the Banking and Commerce Committee, for following a thorough discussion
there we can vote more intelligently on the
motion for third reading.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my friend
who bas just spoken what help he imagines
we could get from the officials of the department as to whether or not we should pass
the bill now before us? The real issue here
is a vital point of principle and of policy.
I suggest that it might be a bit unfair to
ask the officials of any department to come
and express their views on a question of
principle that involves a matter of government policy.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The question of the
honourable senator can be answered very
easily. I stated plainly that the Act passed
last session had not yet been proclaimed,
and I wanted to find out why. My friend cannot give me the reason for it. When I was
a member of the other house-and my friend
was there too-I sometimes voted for second
reading of a bill with the understanding that
it would be referred to a committee, where we
could get information that was not otherwise
available to us.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: May I ask the honourable
senator, if the bill should go to committee,
what kind of official could be asked to tell
us what we should do in this matter?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Surely, the Minister of
Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: This is not an agricultural
bill. We are not raising an agricultural issue;
we are debating a general constitutional question, one of comity between the provinces.
Unless we invite the judges of the Supreme
Court to come and give us their advice-and
I do not think they would care to do so-who
can tell us? Whom should we ask?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The answer to my
honourable friend's question is very simple.
The act it is proposed to amend is being
administered by the Department of Agriculture because it is a dairy act. Surely the
responsibility for the administration of such
a statute could not be in better hands than
those of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Then why not refer it to
the Committee on Agriculture?
Hon. J. Gray Turgeon: I had not the faintest
intention of saying anything at this time
until I heard the discussion which arose
in the last five minutes. Therefore I am
not going to express my viewpoint on this bill,
and my remarks will be very brief.
I agree with the honourable government
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that the bill
sponsored by the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) should be sent to a
committee. In principle I am wholly opposed
to the clause in the Dairy Act which it is
the purpose of this bill to eliminate. When the
Dairy Act was before us last year I stated
that I was opposed to this section, but I suggested that, instead of. voting a six month's
hoist of the whole bill, it should go to committee and be considered there. The bill was
passed, but, as the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) has stated, the
enactment objected to has never been proclaimed. Since the passage of the bill the financial position of a large portion of our farming population has greatly deteriorated. This
is particularly true of the dairy farmers. While

a study by a committee cannot have much
to do with the basic and essential principle
of the bill, it would help us to answer the
question whether the action now recommended, if put into effect at this time, would
cause econornic injury to the large section of
Canada's population that is engaged in dairying. At the same time, I am dead against
the principle of interference in interprovincial
trade. I am inclined to agree with the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
that constitutionally parliament has the full
legal right to permit such interference; and
if I were compelled to vote purely on that
basis, without any consideration by a cornmittee, I would have to vote against the
bill regardless of the fact that in principle
I am 100 per cent behind the purpose of
the measure and of those who are supporting
it. I hope this bill will go to committee so
that we may find out, among other things,
what if any econornic damage it might inflict
upon the dairy farmers of the provinces of
Prince Edward Island and Quebec.
The Hon. the Speaker: The mover may
speak if he wishes, in which event he will
close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I have
very little to say. I congratulate those who
have spoken, almost all of them in support of
the bill which I introduced. I cannot bring
up any new matter, but I should like to
re-emphasize the point that my main argument was not based on the constitutionality
or otherwise of the bill, but was directed
entirely against the principle of interference
with interprovincial trade-a matter which
cannot, I think, be very usefully debated in
any committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The bill could not be
simpler. Its purpose is merely to provide
that the federal government cannot make
any law interfering with interprovincial trade
-and not merely trade in dairy products.
I would draw to the attention of my honourable friend the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) that I have never even mentioned
the word "margarine". The issue is a much
bigger one than that. It is a matter of
principle.
I doubt very much whether anybody, certainly any official, can usefully come before
the committee to help it decide on a policy
which involves principle. The minister might
like to come and make representations. To
that we could make no great objection. I
know that after second reading it is customary to refer bills to a committee.
My honourable friend from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said he would like to

MAY 14, 1952
like the Minister of Agriculture to appear
before our committee, it is up to the committee itself to decide who shall appear before
it. I ascertained that the Minister of Agriculture was going to be absent from Ottawa
at the end of the week, and as I was most
anxious that he should appear before our
committee, I asked him when he might be
available. He replied that he could be with
us this afternoon, tomorrow, or on Friday.
I also took the precaution of calling a meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committee
when the Senate rises this afternoon. Of
course, it is up to the Banking and Commerce
Committee to decide when it shall meet, but
if it wants to carry on this afternoon the
minister has said that he would be available.
I therefore move that this bill be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of Honourable
Senator Robertson, seconded by the Honourable Senator Hugessen, that this bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Before the motion is

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, I may say
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In view of the remarks that I have no objection to this bill

I spoke before, that last year practically no
consideration was given in the Commons to
that bill. I should like to be sure that the
present bill will be carefully considered in
the other place, where the Minister of Agriculture could explain his reasons for promoting the Act and for not having
implemented by order in council the powers
it conferred upon him. It seems to me that he
could very well do so in the other house.
I cannot very well object to the reference
of this bill to committee. I would think it
would be just about as simple to approve it
there as to approve of it here.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I would like to bring
this point of order to the attention of the
bouse. I think the procedure should be to
vote on the second reading of this bill, and
then, if there is to be any debate or discussion about referring it to committee, it would
naturally come up under second motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question, honourable senators, is on the motion for second
reading of this bill. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time on division.

APPENDIX

REPORT OF
ROYAL COMMISSION ON
REVISION OF CRIMINAL CODE
OTTAWA,

February 22, 1952.
To: The Honourable STUART S. GARSON, Q.C.
Minister of Justice,
Ottawa.
Your Commissioners, pursuant to their instructions, have the honour to
submit the annexed draft Bill to revise the Criminal Code which has been
prepared by them under the terms of reference appointing them, as contained
in Order in Council P.C. 2275 of the 10th day of May, 1951.
An examination and study of the Criminal Code was authorized by Order
in Council P.C. 527 of the 3rd day of February, 1949. This task was assigned to
a Commission consisting of Hon. W. M. Martin, Chief Justice of Saskatchewan,
Chairman; Mr. Justice Fauteux and Mr. F. P. Varcoe, Q.C., Deputy Minister of
Justice, with Mr. Arthur Slaght, Q.C., Toronto, as Counsel. The Commission
was to have the assistance of a Committee comprised of Mr. Robert Forsyth,
K.C., (now Judge Forsyth), Toronto, Mr. Fernand Choquette, K.C., (now Mr.
Justice Choquette), Quebec, H. J. Wilson, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of
Alberta, Edmonton, Mr. J. J. Robinette, Q.C., Toronto, and Mr. Joseph Sedgwick,
Q.C., Toronto. The personnel of the Committee was subsequently increased
and Mr. W. C. Dunlop, Q.C., Halifax, Mr. H. P. Carter, Q.C., St John's Newfoundland, and Mr T. D. MacDonald, Q.C., Ottawa, became members of the
Committee. As some members of the Commission and the Committee found
that judicial duties and other commitments made it impossible to devote the
time necessary to the revision and as the work had progressed to a stage where
it could be carried on by a smaller committee, the Committee was reorganized

by Order in Council P.C. 68/4633 of the 26th day of September, 1950. On the
10th day of May, 1951, as above stated, by Order in CounCil P.C. 2275, the
present Commission consisting of Hon. W. M. Martin, Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, Chairman; Hon. Mr. Justice Fernand Choquette, Quebec, His Honour
Judge Robert Forsyth, Toronto, Mr. H. J. Wilson, Q.C., Edmonton, Mr. Joseph
Sedgwick, Q.C., Toronto, and Mr. A. A. Moffat, Q.C., Ottawa, was appointed
and authorized and directed to prepare a draft Bill to revise the present
Criminal Code.
The terms of reference were as follows:
(a) revise ambiguous and unclear provisions;
(b) adopt uniform language throughout;
(c) eliminate inconsistencies, legal anomalies or defects;
(d) rearrange provisions and Parts;
(e) seek to simplify by omitting and combining provisions;
(f) with the approval of the Statute Revision Commission, omit provisions
which should be transferred to other statutes;

MAY 14, 1952
(g) endeavour to make the Code exhaustive of the criminal law; and
(h) effect such procedural amendments as are deemed necessary for the
speedy and fair enforcement of the criminal law.
The Committee appointed by Order in Council in February 1949, and
reorganized by Order in Council of the 26th day of September, 1950, held, in
all, twelve meetings, each one occupying a period of about one week. Prior
to the reorganization of the Committee in September 1950, the Committee
worked in close co-operation with the Commission in making a general survey
of the Code and in laying the groundwork for the present draft Bill. Your
Commissioners have found the preliminary work done during this period of
great value and many of the decisions taken at that time have been incorporated
in the draft Bill. Your Commissioners feel that they would be remiss if they
did not express their appreciation of the very valuable work done by those who,
through judicial duties and other commitments, found that they could not
continue with the work of revision. They therefore take this opportunity to
express their sincere appreciation to
Hon. Mr. Justice Fauteux,
Mr. F. P. Varcoe, Q.C.,
Mr. J. J. Robinette, Q.C.,
Mr. W. C. Dunlop, Q.C.,
Mr. H. P. Carter, Q.C., and
Mr. T. D. MacDonald, Q.C.,
for the very valuable contribution which they made toward the work of revision.
The Commission appointed by Order in Council of the 10th day of May,
1951, has held four meetings, one in each of the months of June, September,
October and November, each meeting extending over a period of about one
week.
The Committee and the Commission have been of the opinion that the
views of the provincial authorities should be obtained in connection with certain
matters, particularly with respect to procedure. For this reason the provincial
authorities have from time to time been communicated with and meetings were
held with their representatives at Calgary in the month of August, 1949, prior
to the annual meeting of the Canadian Bar Association, and in September, 1951,
in the City of Toronto at the time of the meeting of the Criminal Law Section
of the Conference of Commissioners on Uniformity of Legislation in Canada.
The latter meeting was arranged to obtain the views of the provincial representatives with respect to a proposed revision of Parts XV, XVI, XVIII and
XXI of the Code. Certain changes in procedure were suggested in order to
give effect to the following purposes:
(a) to simplify the summary trial procedure and to expedite the disposition
of cases;
(b) to attain greater uniformity in the procedure relating to summary
trials of offences, whether punishable by indictment or on summary
conviction;
(c) to provide uniform procedure with respect to the forfeiture of bail.
It is a matter of satisfaction to be able to report that there was general
approval by the provincial representatives of the suggested changes in
procedure.
EXTENT TO WHIcH REVISED CODE IS EXHAUSTIVE OF THE CRIMINAL LAw

Under the terms of reference the Commission is directed to endeavour to
make the Code exhaustive of the criminal law. Sections 10, 11 and 12 of the
present Code make the criminal law of England applicable in the Provinces of

SENATE
Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba, as it existed on the 17th day of
September, 1792, the 19th day of November, 1858, and the 15th day of July,
1870, respectively, in so far as it has not been repealed by any Act having the
force of law in the respective provinces or by the Criminal Code or any other
Act of the Parliament of Canada. There are no similar provisions in the Code
with respect to any of the other provinces. As to the Province of Quebec, there
can be no doubt that from the date of the Quebec Act, 1774, the English criminal
law has been in force except as altered, varied or modified by competent
authority. As to the Maritime Provinces there are no statutes, Imperial or
Canadian, which expressly deal with the introduction of the criminal law of
England, but that law is considered as having been adopted in so far as it is
applicable to local conditions. Vide: Tremeear, 5th Ed., p. 44, and cases there
cited. As to Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories Act, 1886,
c. 50, as amended by C. 28 of 1897, s. 4, provided that the laws of England
relating to civil and criminal matters as they existed on July 15th, 1870, shall
be in force in the Territories in so far as they are applicable, and in so far
as they have not been altered, varied or modified by any Act of the Parliament
of the United Kingdom applicable to the Territories or of the Parliament of
Canada, or by any Ordinance of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council or of the
Legislative Assembly. When the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were
formed in 1905 it was provided by both the Alberta and Saskatchewan Acts
that all laws existing before the coming into force of those Acts should continue
in the new provinces in so far as they were not inconsistent with the Acts
or where the Acts contained no provision intended as a substitute for them.
In the Province of Newfoundland, broadly speaking, the law of England as
to crime and offences in so far as it could be applied was in force when the
province entered Confederation in 1949. The Criminal Code, however, was
proclaimed in force in Newfoundland on August 1, 1950.
Your Commissioners are of the opinion that the Code should be exhaustive
in so far as criminal offences are concerned, but that the criminal law of
England, as presently in force, should be continued in respect of all other
matters. In order to give effect to this opinion, clauses 7 and 8 have been
placed in the draft Bill. These clauses are as follows:
"7. (1) The criminal law of England that was in force in a province
immediately before the coming into force of this Act continues in force
in the province except as altered, varied, modified or affected by this
Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.
(2) Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any
circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge
continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence
under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except
insofar as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any
other Act of the Parliament of Canada.
8. Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act, no person
shall be convicted
(a) of an offence at common law,
(b) of an offence under an Act of the Parliament of England, or of
Great Britain, or of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland, or
NOTE: Where the reference is to a provision of the present Code, the word
"section" is used. Where the reference is to a provision of the draft Bill, the
word "clause" is used.

MAY 14, 1952

(c) of an offence under an Act or Ordinance in force in any province,
territory or place before that province, territory or place became
a province of Canada,
but nothing in this section affects the power, jurisdiction or authority
that a court, judge, justice or magistrate had, immediately before the
coming into force of this Act, to impose punishment for contempt of
court."
Under these provisions the criminal law of England in so far as it relates to
procedure in criminal matters, common law defences and the powers of a
court to punish for contempt of court are preserved.
Your Commissioners recognize that the original Code was not intended to
be a complete Code and that common law offences were still retained. However, we have come to the conclusion that by incorporating in the draft Bill
all of the common law offences in respect of which charges are currently laid,
all offences which should be adopted from the common law are included. The
offences which have been incorporated are common law conspiracy (clause
408(d), public mischief (clause 120), indemnification of bail (clause 119(2) (d))
and compounding a felony (clause 121). A specific punishment applies in
respect of each offence. Certain common law offences are, in the opinion of
your Commissioners, obsolete and archaic and are not retained, e.g., champerty
and maintenance, barratry, refusing to serve in office and being a common séold.
REARRANGEMENT AND CONSOLIDATION

The Criminal Code was first enacted in 1892 and was founded largely upon
the draft Code prepared in 1878 by the Commissioners appointed by the
Imperial Government for the purpose of drafting a Code of the English
criminal law, and also upon Stephen's Digest of the criminal law. Since that
time amendments and additions have been made at nearly every Session of
Parliament. Some of the amendments and additions have not been placed in
appropriate portions of the Code. Your Commissioners have consolidated and
rearranged sections which deal with the same subject matter and have thus
facilitated reference.
Having regard to the Appendices to this Report and the study which will
be given to the draft Bill, your Commissioners do not consider it necessary to
set out in detail the rearrangement and consolidation that has been made.
However, as an indication of the manner in which this work has been done, a
number of examples are given.
Rearrangement

The present Code allocates provisions under divisions based on subject
matter. One result of this is, for instance, that rules of evidence whether of
general application or related to a particular offence are gathered together
under the heading of "evidence" in Part XIX. This arrangement is inconvenient
because it necessitates not only reference to the provision creating the offence
but also reference to Part XIX for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not
there is a special rule of evidence relating to the particular offence. For
example, section 394 of the Code deals with offences in respect of lumber and
lumbering equipment. Section 990 provides that where the material which
is the subject of a prosecution under section 394 bears a registered mark, this
constitutes prima facie evidence that the material which is the subject of the
charge belongs to the registered owner of the mark.
In the draft Bill, provisions which are of general application are continued
in a Part that is of general application, while provisions which relate to a
specific offence have been put with the section creating the offence. In as much

SENATE

as section 990 is limited to an offence under section 394, it has been carried
into clause 285 so that the special provision relating to offences under this section
may be readily ascertained.
Other examples are cases in which corroboration is required or where there
is a limitation of time for the commencement of a prosecution. In such cases
the requirement of corroboration or the limitation of time is placed with the
clause that creates the offence. In the case of forgery, the provision in section
1002 requiring corroboration is incorporated as subsection (2) of clause 310.
Consolidation
The work of consolidation is designed to do away with duplication and
needless repetition, and provisions are drafted in a form that, where possible,
eliminates particularization and reduces to a minimum the need for amendment. For example, the present Code contains provisions dealing with false
entries in books of account. Section 413 makes it an offence for an officer of
a corporation to make false entries. Section 414 makes it an offence for a clerk
or servant to falsify books of account, etc. Section 418 makes it an offence to
falsify books of account to defraud creditors. Sections 484 and 485 make it
an offence to make false entries in books of account of a government or of a
bank. In all these instances the gravamen of the offence is that it is done
with an intent to defraud. In the consolidation of these provisions (clause 340)
particularization is eliminated and it is made an offence with intent to defraud
to falsify books of account, etc.
Another instance of consolidation to which attention is directed and which
is intended to meet existing and future conditions, is to be found in Part X
which deals with counterfeiting. The object of this Part is the protection of
the currency. By a comprehensive definition of currency and the consolidation
of provisions which dealt separately with the various kinds of coin and with
paper money, a simple and complete code relating to this subject has been
evolved.
Consolidation has also been carried out in matters of procedure. One
instance of this is the creation of a separate Part (Part XIX) dealing with the
calling of witnesses and the taking of evidence on commission. At present
these matters are dealt with in the several procedural Parts. This has resulted
in the enactment of a great number of provisions, each group designed to cover
the subject for the purposes of the proceedings dealt with by the Part in which
they appear.
Your Commissioners have therefore consolidated in one Part (Part XIX)
all provisions relating to compelling the attendance of witnesses and the taking
of evidence on commission.
It has been found that many sections of the Code relating to particular
offences may be omitted because the offences are capable of being dealt with
in one general provision. For example, sections 358-388 create many separate
offences for different kinds of theft. These sections are dropped and only one
offence of theft is created for which appropriate punishment is provided. It is
pointed out that this is in conformity with the policy of Parliament as a similar
step was recently taken in respect of the offence of forgery.
UNNECESSARY

PROVISIONS.

Certain provisions are not retained because the same subject matter is
dealt with in other Statutes of Canada. The following are examples:
Sec. 222A which deals with manufacture, importation and sale of
living bacteria, is now dealt with by the Pest Control Products Act,
R.S.C., 1927, c. 5, as amended by 1939, c. 21.

MAY 14, 1952

Sec. 224 which makes it an offence for a person to expose for sale
articles which he knows are unfit for human food, is now adequately
covered by the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 76, as amended
by 1946, c. 23, s. 2.
Sec. 504A dealing with moneylenders is also covered by provisions
of the Small Loans Act, S.C., 1939, c. 23.
Sec. 506 dealing with offences in respect of copyrights is unnecessary
in view of similar provisions in the Copyright Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 32.
For the same reason we are of the opinion that the subject matter of
clauses 411 and 412 (sections 498 and 498A) should be dealt with in the
Combines Investigation Act. We do not feel free to omit these provisions
from the draft Bill because we are informed that a Committee has been
appointed by the Minister of Justice to study combines investigation legislation.
In our opinion sections 1143-1148 inclusive of the Code relate to matters
which should more properly be dealt with under provincial law. Section 1148
recognizes the validity of provincial law in relation to these matters and most
provinces have expressly dealt with them. To avoid confusion and duplication
these provisions are not retained.
In our opinion section 508 and subsections (4), (5) and (6) of section 515
are of doubtful validity. In any event they relate to matters which should
more properly be dealt with under provincial law. They are in fact covered
by statutory enactments in the provinces.
Section 1048 provides that the court may award as compensation to a
person aggrieved an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars, which shall
be deemed a judgment debt. This has been changed (clause 638) to provide
that compensation may be awarded out of moneys found in the possession of
an accused. The limitation in amount has been removed because the amount
found in the possession of a convicted person sometimes exceeds one thousand
dollars and a limitation might work injustice. The creation of a judgment
debt is considered a civil matter and this portion of the present provision is
not retained.
PROCEDURE

The major changes in procedure have been made in Parts XV, XVI,
XVIII and XXI of the present Code.
Parts XVI and XVIII deal with the trial of indictable offences by magistrates and judges. These Parts readily lend themselves to consolidation
and are combined in Part XVI of the draft Bill. The object of the consolidation is to provide a complete and expeditious procedure for the non-jury
trial of indictable offences.
Under the proposed procedure the special jurisdiction conferred upon
magistrates will be exercised only by those who are expressly appointed for
that purpose. The requirement that magistrates must be expressly appointed
to exercse jurisdiction under the Part is inserted in the expectation that the
provinces will designate only qualified persons. The following is the definition
of "magistrate":
"'magistrate' means a person appointed under the law of the
province, by whatever title he may be designated, who is specially
authorized by the terms of his appointment to exercise the jurisdiction
conferred upon a magistrate by this Part, but does not include two or
more justices of the peace sitting together."
Consideration was given to the extension of the absolute jurisdiction
of magistrates and it was decided that cetrain minor extensions of this jurisdiction would be justified. It is therefore extended to include offences under

SENATE

clause 179 which are cognate to those mentioned in clause 176 and over which
a magistrate now has absolute jurisdiction. Clause 176 deals with betting,
pool-selling and book-making. Clause 179 deals with lotteries. The absolute
jurisdiction was further extended to include attempts to commit the offences
of obtaining property by false pretences, receiving and retaining, where the
value of the property does not exceed fifty dollars.
In view of the requirement that magistrates who are to exercise jurisdiction under the Part must be expressly appointed for the purpose, it was
decided that the number of offences which should now be required to be
tried by judge and jury should be reduced to include only treasonable
offences, piracy and piratical acts, murder, manslaughter, combinations in
restraint of trade, discrimination in trade, accessory after the fact to murder
or treason, attempt to commit murder and conspiracy to murder (clause 413).
The rights of an accused are in no way impaired as he is entitled to elect
whether he will be tried by a judge and jury, by a judge alone, or by a
magistrate.
Provision is made to enable an accused who is in custody in one province
to have charges outstanding against him in another province disposed of if he
wishes, but only where the accused admits his guilt and the Attorney General
(clause
of the province in which the offences were committed consents.
421 (3)

).

The anomaly which presently exists with respect to sentences where a
magistrate tries an offence mentioned in section 773, is abolished. Sentences
which may be imposed for these offences will be the same whether the
offence is tried summarily by a magistrate or is tried by a higher court.
Under Part XVI of the draft Bill no magistrate has absolute jurisdiction
over any offence that is punishable by imprisonment for more than two
years.
Summary Conviction Offences
With respect to Part XV (now Part XXIV of the draft Bill) which is the
code of procedure for summary conviction offences, the purpose of the changes
which are made is to bring about greater uniformity in procedure with respect
to summary conviction offences and indictable offences.
The draft Bill provides that a proceeding under this Part must be
commenced by an information under oath and that more offences than one
may be included in an information as separate counts (clause 696). However,
there is reserved to the court power to order a separate trial in respect of
one or more of the counts where it is in the interests of justice so to do.
Under this Part the right of appeal is extended to permit appeals against
sentence alone. Appeals are to be heard on the evidence taken at the trial
and the powers of the court hearing an appeal in a summary conviction matter
are similar to those of the courts which hear appeals in indictable offences.
In order to ensure that the court will have before it all essential evidence,
authority is given to hear witnesses called on the trial as well as additional
witnesses.
Forfeiture of Bail
The provisions in respect of the forfeiture of bail contained in Part XXI
of the present Code are not satisfactory. These provisions have been completely
rewritten and are contained in Part XXII of the draft Bill. They provide
a simple and uniform procedure for all the provinces.
COURTS

In the draft Bill courts are specifically defined as superior courts of
criminal jurisdiction or courts of criminal jurisdiction. The terminology of
the present Code that involves references to such courts as Oyer and Terminer
and General Gaol Delivery is not retained.

MAY 14, 1952
SnIPLIFIcATION

The provisions relating to arrest with or without warrant by a peace
officer or other person are shortened and simplified. (Clauses 434-438.)
The provisions relating to justification for acts authorized by law to be
done in the administration or enforcement of the law are combined in clauses
25 and 26.
SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES

Your Commissioners have made substantive changes in the criminal law
which in their opinion eliminate certain inconsistencies, legal anomalies and
defects in the law.
One example is that under the present Code on a charge of rape or indecent
assault, the evidence of the complainant need not be corroborated. However,
a rule of practice requires the trial judge to give a warning as to the danger
of convicting on the complainant's evidence alone. This rule is codified and
extended to cases of carnal knowledge (clause 134) with the result that under
the draft Bill corroboration of the evidence of the complainant is no longer
required in cases of carnal knowledge.
GAMING PROVISIONS

Your Commissioners have considered the gaming sections of the Code.
While we are of the opinion that these sections contain certain inconsistencies
and anomalies we have suggested no substantive changes because of the
controversial nature of the matters involved.
SENTENCES

The sentences provided in the present Code follow no apparent pattern
or principle and in our view are frequently not consonant with the gravity
of the offences to which they relate.
Your Commissioners are of the opinion that there should be a few general
divisions of punishment by imprisonment, each offence being assigned to one
of the divisions. Accordingly, apart from the cases where the sentence of
death may be imposed, maximum sentences of imprisonment are provided
as follows:
(a) Life,
(b) 14 years,
(c) 10 years,
(d) 5 years,
(e) 2 years.
Suspended Sentence
The provisions relating to suspension of sentence contained in section 1081

of the Code are varied in clause 638 of the draft Bill. Under section 1081 where
a person is convicted of any offence and no previous conviction is proved
against him, the court may suspend the passing of sentence, but if the offence
is punishable with more than two years' imprisonment, the concurrence of
counsel acting for the Crown is required. It is the opinion of your Commissioners that the powers of the court to suspend the passing of sentence should
not be subject to the consent of counsel for the Crown. It is a fundamental
principle of the administration of justice that the law should be administered
by a free and independent judiciary, and in determining whether a convicted
person should be released on suspended sentence and thus be given an opportunity to rehabilitate himself, or should be sent to prison, the discretion of
the judge should be unfettered. Under the provisions of clause 638 the court
bas power to suspend sentence in the case of any offence without the concur-

SENATE

rence of counsel for the Crown, but the Crown is given an appeal against the
suspension of sentence. (Clause 581 (d) ). The provisions with respect to
previous convictions have been retained.
Fines
The provisions of the present Code empowering the imposition of fines
in lieu of or in addition to any other punishment are retained.
Minimum Punishment
Your Commissioners consider that all minimum punishments should be
abolished and none are continued in the draft Bill.
In 1878 Sir John Holker, then Attorney General of England, in introducing
the original Draft Code in the House of Commons, said:
"Minimum punishments were a great evil, and I am happy to say
that these punishments have been to a very considerable extent set
aside by recent legislation; and now a very large discretion is confided
to judges, and they are enabled, upon their view of the circumstances,
to mitigate the punishment almost to any extent. I think that is right."
Chief Justice McRuer in Vol. 27 of the Canadian Bar Review (1949), p. 1003,
writes in part as follows:
"It is much easier to justify a fixed punishment for murder, with
all the safeguards of review that have been thrown around the execution
of the sentence, than a minimum sentence for theft of a motor vehicle.
An arbitrary law of the latter character tends to corrupt the administration of justice by creating a will to circumvent it. Even parliament
itself has shown such a disposition by the enactment of section 285(c)
of the Criminal Code which, although appearing to create a separate
crime, defies the legal mind to distinguish it from theft properly defined."
Punishment for Summary Conviction Offences
In keeping with our desire for simplification, the draft Bill provides one
general penalty for all summary conviction offences, namely, a fine of $500
or six months' imprisonment, or both.
Indeterminate Sentences
Your Commissioners have considered the question of indeterminate
sentences and have consulted the provincial representatives in the matter.
There was no general feeling in favour of such sentences, and while we believe
they would have some merit, we think it would be impracticable to provide for
such sentences until the requisite machinery, including a parole board, bas been
established.
GRAND JURY

Your Commissioners favour the abolition of the Grand Jury in the interests
of uniformity. It has been abolished in every part of the British Commonwealth except in Canada where it is retained in five provinces, namely, Ontario,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. However, the Grand Jury forms part of the judicial machinery for the enforcement
of the law in those provinces where it has been retained. Moreover it has in the
past been abolished only in those provinces that have asked for its abolition. In
these circumstances we do not feel free to recommend its abolition without the
support of the provinces concerned.

MAY 14, 1952

CRnumIAL NEGLIGENCE
We have considered the question as to the degree of negligence necessary
to constitute a criminal offence.
A great deal of confusion has arisen, particularly in motor manslaughter
cases, as to the degree of negligence required to sustain a conviction against an
accused person. Much of the confusion arises by reason of the standard of care
set forth in section 247 which reads as follows:
"247. Every one who has in his charge or under his control any
thing whatever, whether animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes
or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or
care, may endanger human life, is under a legal duty to take reasonable
precautions against, and use reasonable care to avoid, such danger, and
is criminally responsible for the consequences of omitting, witheut lawful
exeuse, to perform such duty."
This definition appears to impose criminal liability for what might be
termed civil negligence, yet the weight of judicial authority is to the effect that
in order to sustain a conviction, it must be shown that the negligence of an
accused person went beyond a mere matter of compensation and showed such
disregard for the lives and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the
state and conduct deserving punishment.
There is also the difficulty with respect to cases involving so-called
involuntary manslaughter and particularly motor manslaughter in which the
jury is reluctant to convict an accused person notwithstanding that he may
have been guilty of reckless conduct amounting to crimînal negligence. This
difficulty gave rise to the enactment of section 951 (3) of the Criminal Code
which enabled a court, upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, to acquit the accused of manslaughter and find him
guilty under section 285(6) notwithstanding that the degree of negligence
required to warrant a conviction for the major or minor offence was the same.
In order to resolve these difficulties we have dropped section 247 and also
section 951 (3) and have inserted a definition of criminal negligence in clause
191 of the draft Bill as follows:
"191. (1) Everyone is criminally negligent who shows a wanton or
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons
(a) by doing anything, or
(b) by omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do.
(2) For the purposes of this section, "duty" means
(a) a duty imposed by law, or
(b) a duty for the breach of which a person may be found liable ini civil
proceedings."
This definition is followed by clauses 192 and 193 which provide that
everyone who by criminal negligence causes the death of another person is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life, and any
person who by criminal negligence causes bodily injury to another person is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.
The definition of criminal negligence in clause 191 is in accord with judicial
authorities which state that wanton or reckless misconduct is required to support
a charge involving criminal negligence: R. v. Bateman, 94 L.J.K.B. 791; Andrews

SENATE

v. Director of Public Prosecutions, 106 L.J.K.B. 370; R. v. Greisman, 59 O.L.R.
156, and 46 C.C.C. 172; R. v. Baker, (1929) S.C.R. 354. In R. v. Bateman, supra,

Lord Hewart stated that to support an indictment for manslaughter based on
criminal negligence, the prosecution must prove the matters necessary to
establish civil liability (except pecuniary loss) and in addition must satisfy
the court that the negligence alleged "went beyond a mere matter of compensation and showed such disregard for the lives and safety of others as to amount
to a crime against the state and conduct deserving punishment". See also the
remarks of Lord Atkin in Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra,
and Tremeear, 5th Ed., pp. 271 et seq.
It should be observed that under clause 192 any one who is convicted for
causing the death of another person by criminal negligence in operating a
motor vehicle is liable to life imprisonment.
In clause 194(5) it is provided that a person commits culpable homicide
when he causes the death of a human being by criminal negligence. Under this
provision any one who causes the death of another person by criminal negligence
may be indicted for manslaughter, and if found guilty is liable under clause 207
to imprisonment for life.
In concluding the report on the subject of criminal negligence, attention
should be called to the provisions of clause 221 (1) which make it an offence to
be criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle whether or not such
operation causes bodily injury to or death of another person. Because of this
provision it has been unnecessary to retain subsections (1) and (6) of section
285.
PLACE OF TRIAL (NEWSPAPERS)

The Commission has considered that subsection (2) of clause 421 which
provides that the proprietor, publisher, editor or other person charged with
the publication of a defamatory libel in a newspaper or with conspiracy to
publish a defamatory libel shall be dealt with, indicted, tried and punished in
the province where he resides or in which the newspaper is printed. The
majority of the Commission is of the opinion that the provision is contrary to
the well established principle of the criminal law that an accused should be
indicted, tried and punished where the offence is committed and that there
appears to be no good reason under modern conditions why this principle should
not be preserved in relation to newspapers. However, in view of the fact that
this section was recently before Parliament, it is retained in the draft Bill.
CONCLUSION

Your Commissioners desire to state that as to some of the provisions of the
draft Bill there was a difference of opinion. While the draft Bill presented
reflects in some respects the view of the majority only, no useful purpose can
be served by indicating specifically the matters in which differences of opinion
were not fully resolved.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.

SENATE
Robertson for .the second reading of Bill
H-8, an Act respecting the Criminal Law.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
when I was speaking on this debate yesterday, -and before the interruption, I was pointing out that the substantive law was not
affected by the commission's order of reference; that what was discussed by the commissioners was more the phras·eology in which
the criminal law is expressed than the substance of the law itself, a task that in my
judgment was long overdue.
The Criminal Code was drawn, not by one
author, but by many. It came in the first
instance from a report to the British House
of Commons, which was not adopted by that
house; and it did not become law in Great
Britain, although it did here. Year after year
it has been amended and revamped in part,
but never in whole. So the time finally came
when a big job had to be done; the
remodelling of the statement of criminal law.
Although it is the expression of the law
with which we are now concerned, in the
very nature of things the substance of law
also arises, in two ways. In the first instance,
no two words in the English language mean
exactly the same thing; so if the phraseology
is changed, the thought is also changed.
Secondly, we are asked to re-enact the law
in its new dress. Therefore, for two reasons,
the substance of the law-the whole Codeis to be passed upon by this house. In consequence, I submit, this is a serious matter
which should receive the maximum of care.
The commissioners themselves admit that
in some respects they have altered and
revised the substance of the Criminal Code.
For instance, they have abolished common
law offences-and for that I give them credit.
True, there were very few such offences still
in existence, and it was seldom that charges
under the common law were laid in our
courts. How many offences under the common
law had not been included in the Criminal
Code, I for one do not know. Others in the
house may have seen a consolidation or even
a treatise on what was left out of the criminal
law, but I never have. So it seems to me in
view of the ancient legal principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse, and that citizens
are expected to know the law and observe it,
the least we can do is to have an authoritative statement of what it is. To me it is silly
and ridiculous that citizens of Canada should
be called upon to search the ancient texts of
English courts in order to find out what is
prohibited in our own country. The commissioners have removed any possibility of a
charge being laid in Canada for the commission of an offence prohibited by English common law. Only those offences that are to be

found in the Criminal Code may be charged
in Canadian courts under the title of criminal
law. For that, I take it, the commissioners
are certainly to be congratulated.
There have been a number of other
important changes, more than I can discuss
today. For instance, it was the desire of the
commissioners to abolish minimum penalties.
With that purpose, too, I have a great deal
of sympathy. I never liked this hog-tying
of magistrates and judges in the matter of
punishment by making the penalty automatic
upon conviction and stating its amount, so that
a magistrate could give more but could not
give less. The result, of course, has been that
men whom magistrates, judges and juries
did not wish to punish were not convicted.
I myself have seen the criminal law evaded
through the refusal of juries to convict before
a judge whom they thought was unduly
severe; and so an inaccurate decision was
given in order to correct what the jury felt
was wrong. In the matter of these minimum
penalties, the responsibility is not with the
magistrate but with parliament; so a magistrate, faced with the facts, is likely to make
his finding in accordance with the penalty
attached to it, because he cannot proportion
the penalty to the proper finding. The commission has decided to abolish that restriction
and leave the matter of sentence in the
hands of the magistrate or the judge.
I notice, however, that the minister says
he has not wholly followed the advice of the
commissioners in this regard; and there is
something to be said for his point of view.
When a young offender comes before the
court for a first offence, the thought is uppermost that he may not have fully realized
the gravity and the consequences of his act,
and that, having come to realize them, he may
never repeat the offence. But that can
hardly be argued in favour of the man who
drives when in a drunken state or when his
ability to drive has been so affected that he
endangers the lives of his fellow citizens,
because the admonition "if you drive, don't
drink; if you drink don't drive" has been too
frequently repeated for anybody in this
country now to plead ignorance of the dangers
and the wrong of driving a motor-car when
efficiency is affected. Furthermore, the
temptation of magistrates to be lenient when
citizens, otherwise respectable, come before
them, is very great. So there is a good deal
of support for what the minister said here,
that the minimum penalties for drunk driving have not been abolished.
I am not so sure that I go with the minister in the matter of offences against the
Post Office. There is a tendency among departments of government to make themselves
sacrosanct, a fourth estate somewhat different
from ordinary men; and so you have special

MAY 15, 1952
provisions in the Code relating to theft from
the Post Office. I suppose that could be justified as regards an employee of that department whose duty it is to sort mail. There is
upon him some special obligation, uberrimae
fidei, with respect to the mail which he is
handling, and perhaps special penalties might
well be meted out to one who is in a position
of trust of that kind who steals from the Post
Office. But the provisions, as I see them,
are very general. On the boulevard in front
of my house in Toronto there is a box, put
there by the Post Office for the purpose of
assisting postal employees in the sorting of
the mail of the locality. This box is not on
my property, but on city property right in
front of my bouse. Each day Post Office
employees put mail in that box and take mail
from it, and frequently I see, lying beside it,
bags designed for the carrying of mail. These
bags are left unguarded, and anybody could
take them away. If some person assumed
that the bags had been abandoned by the
Post Office, and carried them away, I suppose
the magistrate would have to send that person
to jail, willy-nilly, if he determined that the
bags had been taken intentionally, and it was
a case of theft. I would not go that far. But
this is a matter for discussion in committee.
I wish to congratulate the commissioners
on their boldness and common sense in at
last furnishing a definition of sedition. In
the present code sedition is defined in these
words: "Seditious words are words that
express a seditious intention."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is no definition
of a seditious intention, so you are just like
a little kitten chasing its tail in a circle.
Parliaments and ministers in the past have
shied away from the difficult task of defining
the offence of sedition or of stating what
sedition is. In his address to this house on
Monday last, the Minister of Justice pointed
out the difficulty of condensing in two or
three sentences what constitutes "seditious
intention" as laid down in the reasons for
judgment in which 'the definitions are to be
found. Once again let me point out that
ignorance of the law is no excuse, and that
the obligation to do this difficult thing, which
ministers of justice say they cannot do, therefore rests upon the shoulders of the ordinary
citizen. And if he is charged with a seditious offence he finds that it is no excuse for
him to say that the law-givers of the
dominion had been so loose in their expression of the law that he did not know what the
law was. I say that if it is the duty of anybody to find out what the law of sedition
is, it is the duty of parliament. The commissioners have been bold enough to actually
put into the Code for the first time a readable
55706-19

definition of the offence. At the moment I
think it is also a sensible definition, but I
reserve judgment on this until we have read
it more carefully in committee.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Have you got the wording?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I do not want to interrupt.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is perfectly all
right. It is section 60, and it reads.
(1) Seditious words are words that express a seditious intention.
(2) A seditious libel is a libel that expresses a
seditious intention.
(3) A seditious conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to carry out a seditious
intention.
(4) Without limiting the generality of the meaning of the expression "seditious intention," every
one shall be presumed to have a seditious intention
who
(a) teaches or advocates, or
(b) publishes or circulates any writing that advocates, the use, without the authority of law, of
force as a means of accomplishing a governmental
change within Canada.

Anybody can understand that.
(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4). no person
shall be deemed to have a seditious intention by
reason only that he intends, in good faith,
(a) to show that Her Majesty has been misled or
mistaken in her measures,
(b) to point out errors or defects in
(i) the government or constitution of Canada or
a province,
(ii) the Parliament of Canada or the legislature of
a province, or
(iii) the administration of justice in Canada,
(c) to procure, by lawful means, the alteration
of any matter of government in Canada, or
(d) to point out, for the purpose of removal,
matters that produce or tend to produce feelings of
hostility and ill-will between different classes of
persons in Canada.

Section 61 reads:
61. Every one who
(a) speaks seditious words,
(b) publishes a seditious libel, or
(c) is a party to a seditious conspiracy, is guilty
of an inddctable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

Thus, honourable senators, in a very short
paragraph which has taken me only a moment
to read, we find the whole law of sedition
except, of course, as the words are defined
by the judges in written judgments. Lawyers
will still have plenty to study, but the
substance of the law itself is all there. I
repeat that I give these commissioners credit
for their boldness and common sense in
drafting that section.
I am not so sure, however, about their wisdom in dealing with treason. A section has
been added to the Code, which to my mind
is very doubtful. It is section 46.
46(1) Everyone commits treason who, in Canada,
(c) assists an enemy at war with Canada, or any
armed forces against whom Canadian forces are

SENATE
engaged in hostilities whether or not a state of war
exists between Canada and the country whose
forces they are.

I saw in Saturday Night of May 31 an
editorial which expresses my view rather
well. It says:
. . . the extreme uncertainty and obscurity of the
new definition of treason (a crime punishable by
death) which makes it cover, not merely assistance
to an "enemy," but also assistance to "any armed
forces against whom Canadian forces are engaged
in hostilities whether or not a state of war exists."
The existence of a state of war, and consequently
of a defined enemy, is a matter of proclamation;
the Queen tells her Canadian subjects to whom
they may not lend assistance and when such
assistance becomes treasonable. No such official
action is necessary to turn a legitimate action into
treason when the test is merely that the action
benefits any armed forces against whom Canadian
forces are engaged in hostilities.
Incidentally, this removal of the distinction between "hostilities" and "war" abolishes at one
sweep all the "laws of war" as they have developed
over the centuries, and creates a new situation to
which no precedents or treaties concerning war
have any application. Among other things, it is
not necessary that the Canadian forces in question
should have been ordered into hostilities by any
action of the Canadian government; they may have
been plunged into them by the commander of an
allied but alien army. It may be treason to aid an
armed force which the Canadian government does
not even know is "engaged in hostilities" against
our forces, for the amended Code says nothing
about any action by the Canadian government
whatever.

have even gone so far as to make it an
offence on the part of -anyone to harbour a
member of the R.C.M.P. who deserts or is
absent without leave. Those provisions might
be all right for a military force, but I do
not like to see them applied to a civilian force.
The Saturday Night editorial from which
I have already quoted has a paragraph on
this subject, too, that I think is worth reading:
The ancient and invaluable distinction between
the police forces and the armed forces of the nation
are abolished by amendments which place the
R.C.M.P. on exactly the same footing as the armed
forces, making it as grave an offence to counsel
refusal of duty by a member of the R.C.M.P. as by
a soldier, sailor or airman. The R.C.M.P. is a
civilian force. For that reason and that reason
alone, it has been possible to use it for many purposes for which a military force would be most unsuitable, including the preservation of order during
strikes. If it is to be treated as a military force in
this respect it should be turned into a military
force, and it should be withdrawn from police
work.

I have

every respect for the R.C.M.P., and I do
not wish my words to be understood as
critical of the force at all. I am critical of
the law which we are enacting as applied to
the R.C.M.P.
Then, by way of congratulation to the
commissioners, I wish to mention their statement with regard to magistrates.
It seems to me that in going so far we are

MAY 15. 1952
that the jurisdiction of a magistrate is
enlarged, the requirement that magistrates
must be expressly appomnted to exercise jurisdiction is a most salutary one. When I took
office as Attorney General of Ontario I found
a great many magistrates who had had no
legal training whatever, each of whom sat in
his littie jurisdiction as a sort of Crown Prince
of the locality, and was paid by fees. One of
my first officiai acts was to fire a considerable
number of them-I think it was 89-by one
order in Council, divide the territory Up into
sections, and appoint one, two or three itinerary magistrates for every section. It was a
most beneficial change, but I encountered considerable difficulty because of my determination not to appoint to the Beach any one who
was not qualified for it. Although I had many
batties over this question, during my terni
of office, 1 made no appointmnent of a magistrate who was not a lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Why?
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Because the administration of law requires the knowledge of a lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: While there are some
laymen who by diligence and special aptitudes, and by opportunity, perhaps, know
more about law than some lawyers, 1 think
the general rule may be laid down-with
which evea laymen will agree-that the man
who goes to college to learn law, and spends
some years in the practice of lt, is surely a
speclalist in law. And as we have an administration of law, certainly we want persons
administering it who know what they are
talking about, and to whom other lawyers
may address their remarks with a certain
amount of deference, knowlag that the
occupant of the Bench has gone through the
saine experiences and studies as they have
themselves.
However, the Code does flot require that
only lawyers be appointed to such positions.
I amn only reminisciag when I teil you that
whea 1 had the respoasibility and the authority I appointed nobody except lawyers to the
Beach. I may add that my successors in
office followed that example, and with very
few exceptioas-certainly flot in the crowded
centres-have magistrates been appointed
who were not lawyers. In my opinion it is
as necessary to have an inforlmed magistrate
as it is to have an informed judge. Iadeed,
I have always f elt that the most important
courts in Canada are not the appeal courts,
which deal with civil cases involving millions
of dollars, but the police courts, vihich deal
in human lives. A decision fromn such a court
may, on the one hand, be tragic; or on -the
other hand it may be beneficent. A magistrate's judgment may mean happiness or
55708-19J

reform, or be great benefit to the public
generally. Therefore, 1 think it is as important to have a trained magistrate as it is to
have a trained judge of the County Court or
of the Supreme Court.
My remarks, honourable senators, have
been sketchy. This measure came into our
hands oaly recently, and I arn impressed
with the thought that it should be studied
clause by clause la one of our committees.
Indeed, it is almost impossible to do otherwise. The measure is long and detafled;
almost every section has a background; and
we shahl require the explanations of the
Department of Justice and those who have
been engaged in the drafting of the bill 1o
informn us of the reasons for the changýes.
Only then will we appreciate what changes
are proposed, and the reasons for them. It
will consume a good deal of time to consider
this measure step by step, but it will be
worth while.
I recaîl that when the combined Code
affecting the three armed forces was considered in this house it was referred-I think
to the Banking and Commerce Committeeand a number of my fellow senators and I
sat in considera-tion of it for some days. We
made no less than eighty-three amendments
to the draft bill, ail of themn with the consent
of those persons who prepared it. That
indicates that they were impressed by the
logic of our approach to the subject. I think
we can handie this bill in much the saine
way. True, it may not be necessary to make
as many as eighty-three ameadmeats, for I
believe that many of the sections will be carried almost on the reading of them. Neyertheless, a great deal of care is required, for
when this bill leaves the house with the sanction of the committee that has studied iýt, it
wrnl be received with respect in another place.
I amn prepared, honourable senators, to vote
for second reading of the bill, aotwithstanding:
some difficulties which I and others have
encountered la approaching it, and the lack
of copies of the measure and the documents
supporting: it.
The bill, I think, should
receive second reading as soon as possible.
Ia saying that I do not mean to cut off anybody else who wishes to speak; but let us
give it second reading as soon as possible
and devote ourselves to an inch-by-inch study
of its provisions in committee.
Sorte Hon. Senalor. Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vien. Honourable senators, notwithstandîng the diligent efforts that havebeen made to have an adequate aumber of'
copies of this measure placed in our hands
today, we are now under the samne disability
as we were yesterday.

SENATE
I agree with the suggestion of the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), that the bill should not be
delayed in going to committee. However,
under the circumstances, I think the honourable leader of the government should give
us some assurance that in having agreed
to second reading we are not necessarily
committed to the principle of the bill. With
that provision, I do not object to the bill
now being read a second time and referred
to committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I have the indulgence of the house to add a word? If we
now give the bill second reading, Mr. Speaker
will take note, and all honourable senators
will observe, that we are doing so without
sufficient knowledge of the measure, so that
when it comes back to the house for third
reading no rules will be pleaded against us
to prevent a thorough discussion at that time.
Hon. Mr. Vien: That would apply not only
to the bill in the third reading stage but also
while it is in committee. The rule is that
second reading having been given to a bill,
it has been adopted in principle, and we
should then address ourselves to it clause
by clause. Assurance should be given that
we will not be precluded in committee from
discussing the principle of the bill.

would appreciate the opportunity of knowing something of the background of the
circumstances connected with the matters
under discussion, and our records should be
available to those who wish to see them.
I take it that the greater part of the
bill will be adopted without much discussion, but on certain specific matters some
debate is likely to arise. So not only would
I not oppose reference to committee, but I
would facilitate it and indeed urge it. By
this course a considerable amount of information will be forthcoming which may be
useful to members in the other place, particularly if, because of the pressure of
other business, the bill comes before them
late in the session. In this way we might
turn the other cheek and set a good example,
because sometimes bills are received by
us late in the session and we have to deal
with them without the benefit of any great
amount of discussion in the other house.
Hon. A. Marcoite: I was of course, very
much interested in the address of the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). I understand that by voting for
the second reading we are not committed
to the bill as it stands. It has been stated
more than once in this chamber that our
giving of second reading to a bill does not
mean that we are obligated to adopt it
until we have had more enlightenment on
the subject-matter.
I should like to know whether the committee to whom the bill is to be referred
will have the right to call people before it
to give their opinions on these amendments?
This is one of the most important measures
with which we have ever had to deal. It
is not a matter of conferring more or less
ordinary powers; the bill deals with human
rights and affects human liberties; under
its provisions persons can be sent to jails,
to reformatories, or otherwise dealt with.
This morning I received a letter from a
lawyer in Montreal who has long been
interested in criminal justice. He said he
thought that he and others who were likeminded should have the right to be heard.
I ask that the committee shall have the
power to send for people or to receive the
views of those who want to appear before it.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am entirely in agreement with what has
been said as to the lack of facilities for the
proper consideration of this bill on second
reading, and I now give assurance that I
shall do everything in my power to see that
full opportunity is given for adequate consideration of the measure. This is a large
and an important bill, and I realize how
necessary it is that every opportunity should
be given for the examination of it in committee, and for further and perhaps a more
enlightened discussion of it on third reading.
Some honourable senators may recall that
before the introduction of the bill there was
some suggestion that we might follow the
precedent established in 1914 when the Railway Act was considered, and that, in moving
the bill to committee, I might extend to the
other place an invitation to have some of
its members join with us in considering
the measure. I would have been embarHon. Mr. Robertson: I doubt whether

them. But it is my impression that the
committee of its own volition can do what
the honourable senator has suggested.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Those powers are given to
al standing committees when they are
created, at the beginning of the session.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think so. Certainly I
would not seek to limit their powers by any
statement of mine.
Hon. Mr. Vien: When the bill is sent to committee it will probably be desirable-though
that is for the committee to determine-that
a record be taken, in view of the fact that
this measure was introduced in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I offer one observation on the discussion that bas taken place?
It seems to me that the only principle for
which we are voting when we vote for the
second reading of this bill is that the Criminal
Code of Canada be recodified; and that leaves
us completely free to discuss and suggest
amendments of any one section. If that is the
understanding, I do not see why any honourable member could have any objection to
approving second reading at this time.

so on.

Hon. Mr. Haig: We have that now. I think
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) was correct. We already have,
in the -report of the commissioners, a table
of the sections of the present Code and what
has been done with them. My memory on
these matters is that the indexes are never
prepared until after the bills are passed by
parliament. I think that was the case in connection with the Bankruptcy Act. It is quite
possible that in committee we may accept the
suggestion of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), and that
would necessitate a change in the proposed
definition in the bill before us. Further, the
Senate may take action to strike out some
clauses and to restore others that are in
the present Code. I think we would run
into trouble here with an index.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think that for a bill

think an index is properly part of a bill when

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, I did not mean that.
What I say is that we should be provided
with an index in the committee when we are

been prepared. I know that it is not usually
included in a bill, but there is no earthly
reason why the officers could not produce one

is that the leader intimate to them that we

NATIONAL RAILWAYS
AUDITORS BILL
ANSWER TO INQUIRIES

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
on the motion to adjourn, may I answer three
questions which were asked on the second
reading of the National Railways Auditors

SENATE
Bill by the honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor), who is not in his
seat at the moment? His questions were as
follows:
1. What is represented by the item in the auditors'
report to parliament of $23,347,000 shown as interest
due to the government? How is that amount made
up; over what period does it extend, and what
further information can he give us about it?
2. What is the sterling currency rate of exchange
shown at the former par figure of $4.863 to the
pound?
3. Do the auditors ever make recommendations
such as are made by the Auditor General of Canada
in respect to measures of savings?

The answers to the questions of the honcurable senators are these:
1. The $23,347,000 represent interest accrued
in 1951 and payable to the government of
Canada on government loans to the Canadian
National Railways. The total government
loans to the Railway outstanding at December 31st, 1951 amounted to $857,573,774. The
various loans making up this amount, together with interest rates thereon, are exhibited on Page 32 of the Canadian National
Railways' Annual Report for the calendar
year 1951.

2. The use of the conversion rate of
$4.86§ to the pound is consistent with previous years practice and it is not considered
that a useful purpose would be served by
adjusting sterling rates of exchange year by
year.
This is not a matter of great importance
as the sterling securities held in the several
funds are Canadian National Railways' securities and are offset by the Canadian National
Railways' funded debt.
3. The audit comprises an examination to
test the correctness of accounts covering the
income and balance sheet accounts of the
Canadian National Railway System to see
that revenue and expenditures for capital
and operating are properly treated. The auditors have, on several occasions, made recommendations of savings that would be effected
by a reduction in the fixed charges of the
railway.

million made available in 1944 for loans of
more than $200,000 was found to be insufficient, and in 1949 the Act was amended in
order to make $25 million available for this
purpose. At the present time there are outstanding thirty-two of these loans, totalling
$22 million. This is pretty close to the $25
million authorized for this purpose, so it is
suggested that more money be made available
for this class of loan. This is felt to be
necessary because of the present high cost
of developing natural resources and because
it is deemed advisable to finance industries
which may be necessary for defence.
Honourable senators, if the house agrees to
the general principle of this bill, I shall move
that it be referred to committee, where Mr.
Graham Towers will be available. At that
time honourable members can inquire into
the accuracy of these figures and into other
details of the bill.
I move the second reading of this measure.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I wonder if the sponsor of
this legislation could tell the house where the
offices of the Industrial Development Bank
are situated, and what distribution is made of
the loans?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The offices are in the
Bank of Canada Building. The distribution
of the loans has been pretty general, but I
cannot give the details at this time.
Hon. Mr. Davies: When Mr. Towers appears
before our committee, I hope he will be able
to give us some better answer than that the
loss has been very light. I think we should
know the exact amount.

I was told, "Nothing doing." On the other
hand, if there are many oil wells in a district,
a loan may be granted for the construction
of a refinery. The loans are long term loans.
Precautions are taken, but there being one
hundred commercial transport companies it is
felt that loans are necessary for replacement
and for keeping the service up to a high
standard.

Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I endeavoured to find
that out. With some 600 loans outstanding I
assume that it is difficult to apply exact
figures, but Mr. Towers will be qvailable in
committee to supply the information.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Originally the aggregate
amount of loans was limited to $15 million,
as I recall, but this amount was found insufficient, and it was increased in 1949 or 1950-

Hon. Mr. Reid: Is the general purpose of
this bill to encourage commercial airlines to
develop air service to the North and elsewhere? Is that the chief purpose for increasing the amount from $25 million to $50
million?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Authority to make loans
to commercial aircraft lines is being asked for
because it is felt that these lines should
operate efficiently. It is believed that in the
national interest these lines should be
properly maintained and kept going. Strict
regulations are applied in the granting of
loans. Persons or corporations seeking loans
must invest their own money, and the Industrial Development Bank takes precautions to
see that it gets back whatever money it lends.
For instance, I inquired whether a company
could secure a loan to drill an oil well, and

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable 'senators,
the Industrial Development Bank Act was
.passed several years ago, near the end of
the war, and one of the arguments put forward for it at that time, as I recall, was that
it could be used to assist competent and
capable returned men who wished to establish themselves in business of some kind or
another but did not have the necessary
capital to finance themselves and were unable
to obtain it through the usual channels. It
was intended at that time, I thought, that
the bank would be of a more or less temporary character. It was generally recognized
that the war would be followed by tremendous
economic dislocations, and that a bank of this
kind, with the government responsible for its
administration and providing the capital, could
give a form of assistance that might be very
useful to veterans who were unable to secure
the necessary credit elsewhere. When the
Act was passed parliament was, I believe, in
general agreement with that purpose. Now
it would appear that this is to be a permanent
feature of our economic life.
Hon. Mr. Reid: All these "temporary" things
become permanent.

Hon. Mr. Gershaw: 1949.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It was increased in 1949
to $25 million. Now we are being asked to
increase it to $50 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the larger part.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This bill provides for an
increase in the limitation to $50 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the new limitation
on loans of more than $200,000. On loans
of less than $200,000 the limitation is $15
million.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask a question here?
Does that not make the total limitation $65
million?

Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes.

MAY 19, 1952
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I question the desirability
of the government engaging permanently in
this kind of financing. As I have pointed
out, there was felt to be a temporary need
for the bank right after the war; but now,
it seems to me, we are taking a course
whereby the bank will become a permanent
part of our industrial life. It may be that
this is a wise thing to do, but I am bound
to say that I have some mental reservations
on the wisdom of it.
Further evidence of the purpose to expand
the bank's operations is found in the first
part of the bill, which makes commercial
air services possible beneficiaries of the legislation. I have grave doubts about the wisdom
of that. There is plenty of capital available
for sound projects, and if a commercial air
service cannot go out and persuade private
sources to invest capital in it, the enterprise
may be a poor risk for the government to
help to finance.
I still hold to the old-fashioned theory that
a government or governmental agency is
not equipped to perform the function of granting credit to an organization, or of supervising
the granting of such credit, as efficiently as
a private institution which is risking its own
money in the organization. I do not say
that there has been anything improper in the
administration of the Industrial Development
Bank. Nor am I suggesting that political
favouritism bas been shown, although unquestionably that possibility always exists. That
was recognized at the beginning, but the
overriding possibility that some returned men
might be unable of themselves to get the
capital to start up in small businesses
influenced parliament to provide this form
of assistance.
No doubt the bill will be sent to a committee, and I personally should like to see
there some discussion of the two points that
I have raised.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I must say that my understanding of the
origination of this statute in 1944 differs
from that of my friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar). I think he is mistaken in
associating this legislation with legislation
to enable returned men to launch out on
new business enterprises. In the veterans'
charter legislation there were provisions for
advancing small amounts of money to
returned veterans to enable them to engage
in business. But I do not think-and I speak
subject to correction-that any such purpose
was ever urged as a reason for this particular
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: That is right.
55708-20

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The reason that was
urged was-and it is perhaps a reason that
still exists-that there is a gap in the
financing facilities of the country. On the
one hand there are the chartered banks.
In the very nature of their operations it is
necessary for them to lend on only what
one might call liquid security; they would
not be fulfilling their proper functions if they
were to start lending money on long-term
fixed investments. On the other hand, there
are what one might call the firms of investment bankers, investment bouses which are
responsible for most of the public financing
in the country, and through which big
industries raise large sums of money. But it
was found that these industrial investment
bankers were not normally interested in comparatively small security issues, of the order
of from $50,000 to $1 million. This legislation
was designed to fill a gap in the financing
facilities of the country; and by and large,
as we look back over the past six or
seven years, we can say truthfully enough
that it bas filled that gap.
The great majority of loans made under
this arrangement have been of a comparatively small order. I am sure my honourable
friend from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw)
will confirm me in that. On the other hand,
I think that the majority of the loans have
been made on sound projects. As my friend
has said, there bas been a minute ratio of
losses. That may be due as he remarks, to the
bounding economy of this country., and it
may be that our experience in the future
along this line will not be as favourable as
it has been over the past seven years. I
suggest to honourable senators that if this
legislation were to fall, the gap I speak of
would again develop; but if we keep clear and
definite safeguards against the misuse and
abuse of this legislation-as we do when we
put it into the hands of the Bank of Canada
and its extremely efficient officers-I think
we can well afford to continue to provide
small capitalists with this service which, as
I say, does not appear to be available from
any other source.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I am sorry, but I do not agree with what the
last speaker has said about the motive
behind this legislation; however, I do
agree with the senator who explained the
measure (Hon. Mr. Gershaw). My information
is that many men who gained experience in
their own or in their fathers' businesses,
came back to Canada after the war and
could not get capital to finance their projects.
The commercial banks would not grant them
loans-and for that I do not blame the banks.
The Bank of Canada today has men going

SENATE
about the country trying to get the commercial banks to curtail their loans to farmers
for the purchase of machinery.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But that is farmers'
loans.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, loans on farm
machinery.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is of course quite
beyond the scope of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the principle is the
same.
I was opposed to the bill establishing the
Industrial Development Bank, and I am
opposed to this bill. I doubt very much that
my experience with banks has been very
different from that of my honourable friends.
A practising lawyer in a city like Winnipeg,
situated in a large farming community,
knows that banks will make loans on anything that offers security, if there is a reasonable chance of repayment. In the province
of Saskatchewan, following the depression,
one bank alone wrote off $8 million of
loans. There was not much curtailment of
lending when one bank suffered a loss like
that.
Canada may easily run into stiffer times
than she is experiencing today; and we will
see hard times, if Stalin is right in thinking
that if he can keep us spending our money on
defence, we will break ourselves before we are
through. If times are hard, what is there
to prevent the government of the day from
insisting that the bank make loans? Human
nature does not change, and every member of
the House of Commons who finds things bad
in his district will call on the bank to assist
his constituents, and the bank will have to
do it. That is exactly what has happened
in the United States, and it has caused all
kinds of scandal; the pressure was put on,
and loans were made.
I do not believe that our economy needs
the bolstering that this measure would provide. I do not believe that the banks are
refusing to make loans on reasonable security.
I ask my honourable friend whether, if he
were lending his own money, he would lend it
on a commercial air service venture? I doubt
that he would. But we are going to ask
this organization to do that very thing, and
it cannot very well refuse because parliament
has passed a law providing that loans for
such a purpose may be made.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Surely my honourable
friend is not saying that, because the Bank
Act allows banks to lend money to individuals, they have to lend it to anyone who
comes along?

Hon. Mr. Haig: No, but they do make
loans; and my illustration of the experience
of the bank in Saskatchewan shows that, in
spite of supervision losses do occur. Other
banks may have had similar experiences, for
their managers are not infallible.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But parliament is not
forcing the bank to make loans.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps not, but parliament
is setting out certain projects on which loans
may be made.
We are already spending huge sums in
public financing. For instance, millions of
dollars are going into housing projects but
that is an entirely different picture, for a
person will strive to pay for his home even
if he has to forsake everything else. That is
only human nature. But the passage of
legislation before us would allow the banking
institution to lend on, commercial air service,
a highly speculative commercial business. It
is worthy of note that our own Trans-Canada
Air Lines have, until this year, failed to
show any profit at all. I doubt very much
if other lines have done any better, when
all their losses have been counted.
I repeat that I do not think our economy
needs the kind of bolstering this legislation
would give it. I believe that through our provinces and our municipalities we are pumping
enough public money into the economy of
the country, and I do not think that we
should provide another $25 million by way
of loans on speculative ventures.
Mine may be a voice "crying in the
wilderness"; but the time will come when
such a voice will be listened to. It is my
firm belief that it is not in the interest of
the people to pass such legislation as this,
for we are already putting enough public
money into Canada's economic stream.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.

PARKING ON PARLIAMENT HILL
ACCOMMODATION FOR SENATORS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. C. Hardy: Honourable senators, I
should like to call attention to the parking
situation on Parliament Hill, so far as senators
are concerned. I cannot remember that until
two or two and a half years ago there was
any trouble about the parking accommodation
for members of this house. At that time
they had some seventeen or eighteen spaces
allotted to them at the east end of this
building. For some reason, about two years
ago this accommodation was relocated at the
front of the building where, until that time,
no parking had been allowed. Since then
the berths for senators' cars have been
reduced to fourteen, one of which is, very
properly, reserved. There are also five other
spaces for officials of this house; and at the
east end some twenty or more spaces allotted
to officials or employees of the Senate. As a
result of all this, there is not enough room
for senators' cars, and even some of the
space officially allocated to them is occupied
by others. For example, right now there
are two cars in these spaces which do not
belong to any member of this house.
I do not know who is responsible for the
present situation. Formerly the Mounted
Police had charge and kept a check on cars
coming in, but for some reason they have
withdrawn. I have heard that they refuse
to exercise any supervision in this matter,
except over the small parking space reserved
for ministers at the west end of the building.
I do not know whether this matter is controlled by the Committee on Public Buildings
and Grounds or by the Minister of Public
Works; but I think something should be done
to give senators a little more accommodation,
and especially, that cars which are owned

by other residents of Ottawa who have no
rélation to the Senate should not occupy space
which apparently was intended for members
of this house.
Without directing a regular question to the
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), I would ask him
to ascertain why the present situation exists,
and to see what he can do about it.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
may I be permitted to say that I have the
honour to be a member of the Committee
on Public Buildings and Grounds, and that
this question was brought before us about
seven weeks ago. We sent for solicitors
from the Department of Justice to find out
what were the legal rights involved. Last
fall a man attached to the Press Gallery
parked his car in a place where he was not
supposed to put it. The police summoned
him to the police court, and the magistrate
dismissed the charge. When the solicitors
for the Department of Justice appeared before our committee they stated that they
were not sure of the legal rights.
At this time I should like to pay compliment to the Gentleman Usher of the Black
Rod in the Senate, who has been most diligent in pressing this matter. In fact, he
was pressing it so much that I was beginning to get a little uneasy.
Upon the
request of the chairman of the committee, I
interviewed the Minister of Public Works,
Mr. Fournier. He said: "This is funny; about
four hours ago I instructed my officials to
ascertain the precise legal position of the
grounds so that we could reach an opinion.
In four or five idays I think I shall be able
to let you know just what the situation is."
Those four or five days were up last Thursday. I was unable to see the Minister yesterday, but I intend to have a further interview with him when the Senate rises today.
The position of this matter is peculiar. During the Bennett administration an Act was
passed by parliament placing the control of
these grounds under the Federal District
Commission. The late Prime Minister Bennett,
like the late Prime Minister King, was keen
on giving that commission a good deal of
power. Question now has arisen as to
whether these grounds really come under the
jurisdiction of the Federal District Commission. Mr. Fournier agrees that this should
not be so, and that the situation is anomalous.
Nevertheless, I believe that legislation will be
required to restore this control to parliament.
The R.C.M.P. quite properly refuse to prosecute people who park in wrong places on
the hill. There is a judgment against them,
and they claim that the only thing they can
do is to appeal that judgment. As I say, the
Department of Justice is not sure just who

MAY 20, 1952
has jurisdiction. I would suggest that we do
not need to do anything drastic. Our committee is pressing the question energetically,
and the Minister of Public Works has assured
me that he is just as much troubled as we
are, because he is badgered on all sides about
the parking situation.
Like the honourable gentleman from Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy), I have seen people who
are not even employed on Parliament Hill
park their cars on these grounds, and leave
them there from eight o'clock in the morning
until five o'clock at night. They simply use
the grounds as a public parking place.
I can assure honourable senators that our
committee is very much alive to this problem.
As a matter of fact, if we were not alive to
it the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod
would certainly wake us up in a hurry. The
committee will make its report to the Senate,
and honourable members can then take whatever action they deem necessary.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: I thank the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) for the clear way
in which he has explained the whole situation. I am going to appeal to the leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Robertson) to do what he
can to rectify this situation so that honourable
members will have their own parking places.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I join with the leader
opposite in what he has said about the untiring efforts of the Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod in this matter. I shall do the best
I can, along with the committee, to have some
definite decision arrived at and reported to
this house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just one word more. I want
the house to know that the committee had

The demand for parking space on Parliament Hill is going to increase, and if we are
to provide accommodation for the cars of
employees, as well as those of senators and
members of the other house, we must use
some spaces where parking is not now permitted. I suggest that consideration be given
to the idea of providing underground space
on the hill. True, to do so would cost money,
but why should we not follow the practice of
large industries and furnish employees with
adequate parking space?
I rise to support any move towards a betterment of the present situation. To begin with,
it seems to me that a good many cars could
be parked on surface space that is not now
used. For instance, in the west end of the
grounds I have noticed a piece of grass which
is passed by few people and cannot be seen
from the roadway; I imagine it would hold
fifty cars. But though I never see anyone
walking over it, I am told that it must be
kept in grass. And at the back of these
parliament buildings there is another space
where perhaps thirty or forty cars could be
parked but which is now used for no purpose
at all.
I believe that if the situation were gone into
seriously by those in authority it could be
greatly improved.

organization; they prefer to retain control
of the regulations and fundamental principles that govern the admission of members
to these 'bodies, and the practice of their
respective professions.
I emphasized this point when we were discussing the Canada Land Surveys Bill. In
that measure .there were two or three features which might have justified it, although
I could not see it that way. At any rate the
argument was advanced, that, for various reasons, government lands held in various parts
of the country needed a uniform system of
land surveying and qualified land surveyors of
a standard that would be recognized throughout Canada. There were certain reasons to
which, without being convinced, we yielded.
The bill before us is another invasion of the
provincial field; and I do not see why it is
necessary, when every province bas a dental
body with an examining board of its own, to
drive the thin end of the wedge in that way,
as has been done already in other directions.
Therefore, unless I am shown that the public
interest is involved and will be better protected by a system of this kind, I am determined to oppose the bill with all the ability
and vigour which I possess.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
although I agree with everything that has
been said by the honourable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), I recall having
been a member of the Manitoba legislature
when the medical profession formed a
dominion-wide
association. I then held
exactly the same views as my honourable
friend; but I must ;candidly confess that the
establishment of that association has wonderfully improved medical standards throughout
the country.
I do not favour any encroachment upon
provincial jurisdiction. It was, I agree, the
special purpose of the Fathers of Confederation
to protect both sides to the compact, because
had they not done so there would have been
no confederation. At the same time it must
be recognized that one of our national problems is to obtain enough men and women
dentists, and to assure the same standards
of efficiency in ail parts of the country.
This bill will not affect Manitoba at all. The
province grants its own licences, and only
those to whom licences are granted may practise dentistry in Manitoba. But it is always the
dominion associations which are responsible
for higher standards. The more expert professional men join the national body, and its
work reacts on the provinces. The same is
true in the realm of medicine. Manitoba has

a medical college, if not the greatest in the
dominion, a very good one. It has been
established over fifty years.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Much longer than fifty
years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, my recollection goes
back only fifty years. Before then I was
mainly interested in trying to make a living.
Hon. Mr. Howden: I graduated nearly
fifty years ago from the Manitoba Medical
College, and it was in being a long tine before
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And I am sure that everybody in Manitoba believes that the Canadian
Medical Association bas effected improvements in standards of medicine in our college.
I hope this bill will be sent to committee.
I am sure that when it has been further
explained, honourable senators will realize
that Quebec provincial jurisdiction is not
being encroached upon. To join the association is a voluntary act. As my honourable
friend knows, there are in Canada two
systems of law; the Civil Code in the province of Quebec, and the common law elsewhere. I can remember-of course, the
parallel is not exact-that when the Canadian
Bar Association was formed it encountered
quite a bit of opposition from the province
of Quebec. But the effect of the work of the
association was to improve standards of legal
training; and today the Canadian Bar Association probably has no stronger supporters
than the lawyers of Quebec. Its purpose and
its effect are not to encroach on the provincial law of Quebec or of Ontario or any other
province, but to advocate improvements in
the general laws of the country.
I hope the house will send this bill to
committee. I hope, further, that the effect of
the bill will be to induce young men and
women to enter the dental profession, so that
Canada in years to come will have more
dentists than it bas now.
Hon. J. P. Howden: I have a good deal of
sympathy with the objects of this bill. A
good many years before I was born, Manitoba
had a medical college, and later, somebody
conceived the idea that, through a superior,
federal authority prescribing an examination
for young medical graduates, it should be
made possible for them to practise in any
province in Canada without being required
to take a separate examination in any
province to which they might go. Thus was
created what was known among our doctors
as dominion registration. Sir James Grant
was knighted for having promoted legislation
for this purpose and for getting it through.
Possibly with one or two exceptions, there
are medical colleges in every Canadian

SENATE
province; and when a student graduates from
one of these colleges, he can take promptly
and immediately-while the subjects are fresh
in his mind, before they have had a chance
to become stale, and it has become difficult
for him to pass an examination-what is
called the dominion registration. When he
has done that, by paying a licence fee he
can practise in any province of Canada.
It is for a similar purpose that this bill
is before us. It is intended to make it
possible for a dentist who bas qualified in
Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, or
anywhere else in Canada, to take the
dominion registration in dentistry, and, by
paying a licence fee, to practice anywhere,
with assurance to the public that he has
passed a good satisfactory qualifying examination. That is the whole story. The dentists,
like the doctors, want to have dominion
registration.
Hon. Mr. Vien: May I have the consent of
the Senate to say one thing more?
The object which has been explained to
us is the one thing we should guard againstnamely, the creation of a dental body with
power to issue a certificate which will give
to those who qualify under it the right to
register and to practise in any province.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But each province specifies
the terms of registration.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Oh, yes, but the terms of
registration are the same for everybody.
We want the boards governing the various
professions in the provinces to have the
right to determine who is qualified and who
is not. We do not want this right to be
placed with any national board. In other
words, we do not want to see any such board
given authority to issue a certificate which
gives the holder thereof the right to register
and practise.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Manitoba, like some of
the other provinces, has no dental college.
Is it not a fact that this bill is designed in
order to provide some recognition for dentists
practising in provinces where there are no
dental colleges? We have a medical college
in Manitoba but no dental college, and I think
this legislation is aimed to provide us with
some recognized standard in dental matters.
Hon. Mr. Howden: There is no desire here
to impose anything upon graduates. As a
matter of fact, it is something urgently sought
by the graduates of the various dental colleges. Instead of having to pass some twelve
holding
dental graduates
examinations,
dominion registration will be able to practise
anywhere in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If a dental graduate acquires
a certificate of competency from the National

Dental Examining Board of Canada, will he
have the right to practise, say, in British
Columbia, even if the British Columbia
Dental Association is not a member of the
National Board? In other words, would the
decision of the National Dental Examining
Board override anything that the province
does?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: No. The provincial
licensing board will be responsible for
authorizing dental graduates to practise dentistry.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I entirely agree with the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), who
has raised the question of constitutionality.
This whole matter falls under the heading
of education, which is under provincial
jurisdiction. We have no business interfering
with or encroaching upon that reserve.
I am opposed to this bill if it does what
has been suspected, but I think the answer
is to be found in the bill itself. Section 6
reads:
6. The purposes of the board shall be
(a) to establish qualifying conditions for a single
standard national dental certificate of qualification,
which may be recognized by the dental profession
as the highest in Canada;

At the present time we have in Canada
the right to establish national standards of
length, breadth, weight and so on. We also
have the right to establish standards of
quality for farm produce and the like, and
under this bill we would have the right to
establish national standards in dental matters. These standards will not override any
provincial jurisdiction; but if a dentist
acquires a national dental certificate of qualification he will be able to put that information
on his shingle. According to the Bill, this
is a standard which may be recognized by
the dental profession and not necessarily by
anybody else. Clause (b) reads:
(b) to ensure that the rules and regulations
governing examinations will be acceptable to all
participating licensing bodies and will provide for
the conducting of examinations in a manner fair
and equable for all concerned;

It is not "to all licensing bodies" but "to all
participating licensing bodies".
Clause (c) reads:
(c) to promote enactment, with the the consent
and at the instance of the corporate members of
the Canadian Dental Association, of provincial legislation necessary or desirable to supplement the
provisions of this act.

That is the important part of the bill.
From a quick reading of the bill, I would
say that this body has no legal authority.
Hon. Mr. Howden: That is the idea.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am not so sure that
this body will even grant a title, but it will

MAY 20, 1952
grant a certificate specifying that a certain
examination has been passed and that certain
approval has been extended. That is as far
as it can go. The board may, however,
induce provincial governments to pass legislation which will make its decisions law in
those provinces. Without that legislation, the
decision of the National Dental Examining
Board of Canada will have no legal constitutional validity in any province. While I
would read this legislation with great care
and with -some suspicion for fear that it
infringes on provincial authority, at the
moment I do not see that it does.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Will the honourable
senator read section 7 as well?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It reads:
7. The Board shall have power to
(a) establish a qualification in dentistry such
that it will be recognized by the appropriate
licensing bodies in all the provinces of Canada;

I see nothing wrong with that. It just says
the board shall have power to establish a
qualification in dentistry that will be
recognized.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Must it be recognized?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I was wondering about that,
because I think it was said a moment ago
that when a dentist has this dental certificate
he can go and practise in any province upon
paying the license fee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the idea, but it
is not in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Must a provincial body
grant a dentist the right to practise if he
holds a national dental certificate?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I take it that that is
not so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Well, that constitutes an
interference.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It says that the board
shall have the power "to establish a qualification in dentistry such that it will be
recognized", not that it shall be recognized.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Use the word "accepted"
instead of "recognized".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It means about the same
thing. It is their desire, not their legal
authority.
Hon. Mr. Vien: It says "the Board shall
have power."
Hon. G. Lacasse: Honourable senators may
be interested to hear from a man who is a
product of the first year of operation of what
was known as the Roddick Bill. I took advantage of that legislation right after its enactment, and I understand from what has been

said by the honourable senator from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden), that the bill before
us is more or less a replica of the Roddick
Bill.
The Roddick Bill had to do with the medical
profession, and was enacted in 1913. It has
therefore been in force for forty years; and it
is because of that bill that I, although born in
Quebec and a graduate of Laval University,
in Montreal, have been practising medicine in
Ontario for the last thirty-eight years. I was
one of the first beneficiaries of that legislation. But before being allowed to practise in
Ontario I had to have the degree of M.D.
from my own province, and then I was
required to submit to an additional examination under the auspices of what is still called
today the Medical Council of Canada, which
was the offspring of the Roddick Bill. After
having successfully passed that examination
I had to be accepted by the provincial authorities in Qntario, and to pay the required registration fee. Under the provisions of the Roddick Bill, had I been more than ten years in
practice I would have been free to hang up
my shingle in any province where I chose
to go, without any further ado other than
payment of the provincial fee.
As I say, I think this bill is more or less
a copy of the Roddick Bill. If there are any
differences between the two, this should
be an improvement on the earlier one,
because of the experience that has been
gained since 1913. I do not think the bill
presents any challenge to provincial rights
or prerogatives.
As I see it, the purpose of the bill is simply
to help dentists who wish to move from one
province to another to practise their profession. There is nothing of a compulsory
nature at all about the measure. Those who
desire to take advantage of its provisions will
be free to do so, upon complying with the
laws of the province into which they move.
A dentist who intends to practise in the province in which he graduates, would of course
not submit to the additional examination and
pay the fee required of one who moves to
another province.
This explains the bill as I understand it,
in the light of my personal experience with
the Roddick Bill, which gave birth to the
existing Medical Council of Canada.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, the question is on the motion for
the second reading of the bill. Is it your
pleasure to carry the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Vien: No.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

DIVORCE BILLS

Hon. Mr. Gershaw moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, may
I suggest that the provincially constituted
bodies which control these professional matters in each province be notified of the date
at which this bill will be considered in committee and invited to express their views to
the committee?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It seems to me,
honourable senators, that notice of the date
of the committee's hearing on the bill should
be sent to the Attorneys General of all the
provinces, so that if they have any objection
to the bill we may hear of it.

SECOND READINGS

Hon. Mr. Vien: That is agreeable to me. I
should like to have the house express formal approval of that suggestion, and if
necessary I will move that that be done.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Excuse me, but I do not
think that is a matter for the house. That
can be attended to in committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The Chairman of the
Miscellaneous Private Bills Committee (Hon.
Mr Bouffard) is present and will have noted
the suggestion that has been made. I am
sure he will act accordingly. If, when the
bill is reported back from committee, any
senators thinks that the attorneys general of
the provinces were not notified, that would
be a very pertinent question to raise here at
that time. It seems to me that, as stated by
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), notice of
the committee's hearing on the bill is a matter
for the committee to consider, and that no
formal action by the Senate is necessary.

National Railway Company to build, at an
estimated cost of $10 million, 46 miles of

railroad from Terrace to Kitimat in the

SENATE
northwestern portion of British Columbia.
The purpose in building this road is to
permit the carrying on of the work projected
in that part of the country by the Aluminum
Company of Canada. I shall take the liberty
of saying a word or two about what this
work will mean to British Columbia and
to Canada as a whole; but first of all,
naturally, I shall deal with the proposed construction of the line of railway. The Aluminum Company has already expended very
large sums of money in making preparations
for carrying through this great project, which
it is expected will be completed in five years
at the most, and the company estimates that
by that time it will have spent on the whole
project more than $500 million. Without
the proposed line of railway it would be
practically impossible for the company to
carry on the work that it bas planned.
One interesting and incidental feature
which should be mentioned is that the
Aluminum Company is giving to the railway
company a guarantee concerning the revenueproducing trafflc over the 46 miles of the
proposed railroad line from Terrace to Kitimat.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: For how long?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I should like to put on
record a statement on the volume of traffic
over the Canadian National Railways in
that part of British Columbia. I am thinking now of the line running from Jasper to
Prince Rupert, and particularly of that portion of it in British Columbia running
through McBride, Prince George and Terrace, and on to Prince Rupert. In 1951 the
traffic on that portion of the Canadian
National Railways included a total of 20,000
cars of revenue-producing freight. Of this
total, 14,000 cars carried lumber, which was
not only a high revenue producer but constituted long-haul traffic, largely across Canada. Also, on the return trip cars were able
to carry grain westward to Vancouver and
New Westminster, and to return north,
through Red Pass Junction, and pick up and
carry eastbound revenue-producing freight.
That is a picture of the fraffic which moves
in this area today.
As one who is very much interested in the
development, both actual and proposed, of
that northwestern area, ýI sometimes wonder
what the next ten years will produce. We
will have not only the aluminum products
to consider but the related industrial development. There has been a good deal of
talk during the past few years about oil
and gas; there has also been considerable
discussion as to what will happen with
regard to coal. Within easy access of Prince

George there are the Hasler Creek, the Bowron Valley and other coal fields. It is aise
notable that the great dam which will supply water to Kitimat is only about a hundred
miles west and slightly south of Prince
George. This whole country will provide a
market for gas, and for coal when gas is
Further, it will give the

Research Council of Canada an opportunity
to carry out a suggestion already made in
this chamber, that there be a continued
study of the possibilities of producing gas
from coal. The aluminum plant will of
course use hydro power, and will not need
gas.

permit a question? Who are the promoters

imagine that a great deal of money is coming from the United States, and the company
may be a subsidiary of an American company. It is the same company that has been
carrying on work at Arvida in the province
of Quebec, operating through a purely Canadian subsidiary. It will be remembered that
when the Aluminum Company plant was
being proposed, and before it had reached the
stage at which we now see it, many people
in the United States said they would net
take any of this company's products. They
wanted the money to be expended for the
production of aluminum in the United
States rather than for the purchase of it from
Canada. I think that answers the question.
The capital involved here is not necessarily
of United States origin, and a good many
American capitalists were not anxious to
see aluminum produced here for exportation
to the United States. But American opinion
bas taken a more favourable turn, and I
understand that their tariff on aluminum
has been reduced 25 per cent to enable our
product to be admitted more freely.
This railroad, which will run to Kitimat
from Terrace, will be built at a probable
cost of $10 million. The estimated net revenue
in the first five-year period, part of which is
guaranteed by the company, is $1,100 per
year, provision being made for the payment
of interest on the $10 million.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Have the contractors
undertaken to build the road for $10 million,
or is that figure merely a guess?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It is the amount which
Canadian National Railways and their
engineers have estimated to be the cost, and
which, so far as any guarantee by the federal
government is concerned, they are authorized

MAY 21, 1952
to expend. Also, it represents the basic consideration in the company's guarantee of
traffic.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator, where is Terrace?
Hon. Mr. Horner: How many miles is it
from the Pacific coast?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Terrace is approximately ninety miles from Prince Rupert, and
Kitimat is forty-six miles south and a little
west of Terrace. Kitimat is on what is called
the Kitimat Arm, which runs down Douglas
Channel into the Grenville Channel, which
extends as far as Prince Rupert, about ninety
miles away.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does the honourable
member know whether it is proposed to
electrify this new branch?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Not so far as I know.
I do not think there is any reference to electrification in the bill. That will be a matter
for consideration by the company, and it
might be appropriate to suggest that the railway be operated with electricity rather than
in any other way.
Hon. Mr. Euler: To what extent is payment
of revenue guaranteed?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: To minimize the prospect of loss, the -company has undertaken to
assure a certain definite amount of traffic to
the railroad during each year.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is that a contractual agreement? Is the guarantee in the form of a
contract?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It is a guarantee given
by the Company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It does not appear in
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Where could we find the
contract containing the guarantee given to
the railway?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I suppose it would be in
the headquarters offices of the Canadian
National Railways. If the bill should receive
second readdng, I shall suggest that it be sent
to the Committee on Transport andI Communications. I have no doubt that we can then
get full information on this or any other
question.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The honourable senator is
not familiar with the details of the
guarantee?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: No, definitely not,
except that it guarantees a certain volume
of traffic, and that it does not exceed $10
million. This is a matter between the railway company and the Aluminum Company.

At a meeting of a committee of the other
place, a representative of the Aluminum
Company stated that he had got into some
trouble with his head office for having given
such a guarantee, but the guarantee will
stand.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
stated a little earlier the amount of revenue
which might be expected. I gathered that he
had not quite concluded his remarks.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: No. Some questions
intervened.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: He spoke about $1,100.
Was that the figure per mile, or for the whole
line?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That was on this fortysix miles of new line.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: $1,100?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes, $1,100 estimated
annual net profit over and above expenses,
including interest, for the first five years.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is pretty fine figuring
on an expenditure of $10,000,000.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It is al very well to
say that it is pretty fine figuring, but that is
all that anybody can do. If, in our committees or anywhere else, we ask a businessman or someone else to give an estimate, he
does his best, and, while it may be "pretty
fine figuring", that is all one can get.
As to the question asked by the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) the
estimated annual net revenue over and above
all expenses, including interest on $10 million,
is $1,100.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is that over the whole
line? Or per mile?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: That Is the net revenue
per year over the whole line; the net annual
profit on the operation, after all expenses, in
the first five years. For the second five years,
after making provision for interest on the
$10 million, the estimated annual profit is
$323,000. That is a tremendous increase, but
it is to be remembered that naturally, in the
first five years there will not be very much
production. I understand that the plant will
not be properly in operation until 1954.
Some period must elapse before any newly
constructed railroad can make a profit. That
is true of the line we are now discussing,
just as it was true of another railway, which
we had a great deal of pleasure in approving,
running into northern Manitoba to aid the
development of the mineral resources of that
province. The difference between the two
cases is that here there is a guarantee. I am
not a lawyer, and I cannot tell how good

292

SENATE

the guarantee is, but I assume it was mtade
because of the possibility that something n ight
go wrong and that adequate traffic would not
be available. On that question, however, let
it be remembered that with the exceptio n of
the Pacific Great Eastern which runs n()rth
and south, and in the course of the next few
months will enter the city of Prince Geo rge,
this is the only railroad which will SE
ýrve
that part of British Columbia. The Canac ian
National Railways runs from Prince Ru]pert
through Prince George, Jasper and Edmor don
in any event, whether or not this forty -six
miles is built. But through this forty-six rnile
project there will come about the h uge
development of the aluminum plant, w]hich
will increase very greatly the traffic of the
Canadian National Railways, and will mar vellously aid the development of agricult ure,
mineral production, and various other aci ivities in the north-central region of Bri tish
Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the spor sor
of this bill whether all that was taken iIso
into
consideration when this figure of $23 per rmile
profit was estimated? The honourable sE
nator has told us that the total cost of this
forty-six miles of railway will be $10 mill ion,
or approximately $200,000 per mile, and I hat
the anticipated profit will be $1,100 for ,hie
the
first five years. Am I right in these figui es?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: You are right so fair as
the $1,100 per year is concerned. I have not
worked it out per mile. The estima ted
revenue for the second five years is mi iltiplied over and over again and, as I s aid,
reaches $323,000 per year according to the
railway officials. I hope that I have answe red
the honourable senator's question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask another qi:estion? You have told us that this railroa 1 is
essential to the success of the great alumir um
project upon which $500 million will be
expended. As this project is already un der
way and the company is committed to it, -vhy
has there been a delay in asking for legi slation to authorize the building of this railw ay?
Why was this not done before the alumir uni
project was even commenced?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: One thing I know, t ;bat
everyone from British Columbia would h ave
been upset had the project been delayed for
any reason at all. My honourable friend has
asked a natural question, but if he looks b ack
over the history of Canada he will find t;bat
this is what has always taken place in ar eas
being newly developed. After making ail
the necessary arrangements, this comp any
had to obtain certain rights from the p)rovincial government, and if it had waited* to
have every single item carried out with p
liamentary sanction, the project would never

have been proceeded with.
When this
aluminum project was first under serlous consideration, there was a great howl from the
United States. If the promoters had said,
"We must have this and we must have that"
the chances are the project would neyer
have been carried out.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I take it that the raw material, bauxite, will be brought in to this plant
by water?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If that is the case, could
not the finished product b shipped out in the
sane way? Is the railway absolutely necessary? I am just asking for information.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The product will probably core fron Jamaica and British Gulana.
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: You mean the raw
material?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes, the bauxite wil
probably corne froni Jamaica and British
Guiana, but some of it might core fron other
places. The fact that the Aluminum Corpany
wants this railroad means that it is essential
to their plans. Otherwise they woud not
bother to seek authority to buid the railroad,
a nd they wouid not give a guarantee of even
$1 in connection wîth it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If the raw material can be
brought in by water, why cannot the finished
product go out the sane way?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It al depends upon
where the product is going. In the first place,
in order to construci this plant many thousands of tons of steel, copper and iron are
going to be required. As I understand it,
ail but 5 per cent of the producis going into
the construction of the plant wili originate in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: A large part of these
materials will be brought in by railroad.
Some may core by water via Vancouver,
Victoria and New Westminster, but a great
deal wiil be brought in by rail by the C.N.R.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It could corne by rail te
Prince Rupert, and then be brought down by
water.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It could core by boat
te Prince Rupert and then over the Canadian
National Railway te Terrace and down to
Kitiat on the proposed forty-six miles o!
railroad.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If this railroad were not
built, could not this material be brought to
Prince Rupert by rail and be transported by
"arwater to Kitimat?

MAY 21, 1952
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It could. The honourable senator who asks the question was once
Minister of Trade and CommerceHon. Mr. Euler: Why bring that up?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: -and he knows just
exactly what this means to a company which
is entering into trade and commerce.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I apologize. I am not
opposed to it.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
while the raw material, bauxite, will come
mainly from Jamaica and British Guiana,
within the last few days a report has emanated from a newspaper in Prince George that
bauxite has been discovered in British
Columbia, in the area between Vanderhoof
and Fort St. James. It bas further been
reported that this is not a commercial bauxite
that can be ordinarily used. On the other
hand, it could be used if the company were
hard pressed to obtain this material elsewhere. During the war years this area between
Vanderhoof and Fort St. James produced all
the mercury needed by Canada to prosecute
the war against Hitler and Mussolini. This
is the same general area which will be
greatly developed as a result of the construction of an aluminum plant in the vicinity of Kitimat.
The questions that have been asked today
bring to my mind an objection that was
raised earlier as to whether this aluninum
project would cause the damming of waters
in that area. I will not try to specify in
detail what waters will be dammed, but this
marvellous project, one of the greatest works
of its kind ever undertaken on this continent, will eventually affect the waters
flowing into the Fraser river. It is suggested
that the effect upon the waters of the Fraser
river may play a part in freeing the Fraser
valley from the floods that have devastated
so much of that area during the last few
years and in previous times.
One of the points that came up for discussion was the probable or possible effect of
the construction of this great undertaking
upon the fishery production of British Columbia, particularly salmon. That point was raised
at the very beginning, when the company was
wondering what sites it should try to secure
from the government of British Columbia,
and it was raised also atter the present site
was determined upon. I think the problem
bas now been solved to the satisfaction of
everybody in the province, and I wish here
to pay tribute to a few of those who had
much to do with bringing about the solution.
I wish to mention particularly the Minister
of Fisheries, the Honourable Mr. Mayhew,
himself a British Columbian; the officials

working with him; the Minister of Lands
and other ministers in the Goverrnent of
British Columbia; the honourable member
of the other bouse, who represents the district
in question, who is deeply interested in
fisheries and who accompanied the Minister
of Fisheries to Japan for discussions on the
draft of the Fisheries Treaty between that
country and Canada. And especially I wish to
pay tribute to one of our own colleagues, the
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), who is always deeply interested in
anything concerning the welfare of the fishing
industry. He played an important part in the
solution of the problem, by doing everything
he could to make sure that the aluminum plant
would be so located as not to interfere unduly
with the production of fish in British Columbia
waters. Because of the efforts of these gentlemen, I think it can be safely said that there
is no longer fear of any dispute between those
sponsoring the aluminum project and the
people interested in the fishing industry.
For the reasons stated, honourable senators,
I ask your support of the motion for second
reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: Can the honourable senator state about how long it will take to
build the railway?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I am unable to give
a definite answer. I should; point out here
that Kitimat, although inland some 90 miles,
is free of ice all the year around, and I
do not think the construction should take
very long.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
should like to say a few words on this
important measure. At the outset may I thank
the senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon)
for the kind words he said as to my part in
protecting the fisheries while the location of
the aluminum company's site was under consideration. It is rather interesting to me to
listen to praise of the fishing industry here
today. I am going to tell a little story about
some of the facts behind this aluminum project, but first I want to assure this bouse and
sponsors of the bill that I have no intention
whatever of trying to block construction of
the railway or of interfering with the Aluminum Company's proposal. The railway will
serve a very useful purpose, but I happen to
have certain information which I feel honourable senators would be interested to hear.
When the agreement between the province
of British Columbia and Alcan-the Aluminun Company of Canada-was made public,
I naturally had a copy of it and wanted to
find out just what rights had been given to
the company. What the province does is of
course its own business, so I am not going to
discuss provincial matters, but I may say that

SENATE
we began to keep an eye on the activities
of Alcan, which made application to the
British Columbia water powers board for two
sites in the interior of the province. We were
greatly perturbed over what the board might
do'with the application for rights, particularly
on one of these sites, which was in the Chilko
Lake district, for had that application been
granted more than half of the sockeye fishing
industry of the Fraser River would, in my
estimation, have been destroyed. Therefore
we opposed that application very strongly, and
so it was not granted. The company then
proceeded with its application for the site at
Nichako, where it is now carrying on. Those
of us who raised our voices on behalf of the
fisheries-I in particular-were immediately
assailed, accused of wanting to prevent progress in British Columbia and of being
opposed to Alcan.
Let me here answer the senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) who asked about
the company, for I can say with pardonable
pride that I have gone into this matter very
seriously, and know whereof I speak. While
the company is not tied up legally in any way
to Alcoa, the Aluminum Company of America,
the companies have what is known in law
circles as a common interest. For instance,
Alcan is a fully owned subsidiary of the
Aluminium Company of Canada and this
company is controlled by the directors of
Alcoa, the United States concern. Nine directors of the Aluminium Company of Canada
are also directors of Alcoa. I have maintained
that no bigger cartel exists in this country
than this aluminum set-up. However, that
is just by the way.
Because I am interested in the fisheries and
because I warned the people of British
Columbia that they had better beware and
keep their eyes open to protect the general
public before giving away such a great natural
heritage, I was accused of and branded as
being against progress and against the Aluminum Company. As a matter of fact, it was
stated by some prominent persons in provincial public life that my remarks were likely
to chase the Aluminum Company out of
British Columbia. Now, honourable senators,
no statement could be more ridiculous or
untrue than that, because at present you could
not chase new industry out of British
Columbia with a Gatling gun. The whole
country out there is booming, and American
capital is flowing in as never before. I have
a list of the big projects under way, and I
am sure you would be astounded at the
size of some of them. British Columbia is
getting into her stride. Why, here is an
expenditure of $350 million on expansion in
pulp and paper mills, there are 300 gas and
oil areas or sites, there are twelve new mineral

developments, and the forest industries alone
are spending $450 million. All these are new
projects. In the face of these facts, to say
that any little argument of mine would keep
this cartel or great Aluminum Company out
of the province is just utter nonsense.
However, I am going to keep my remarks
within moderate bounds. I realize that there
is a provincial election on in British Columbia.
Also I am aware that this matter is of a very
highly political nature at Washington, and has
been so for the past nine months or a yearI know that for a certainty. I am going to
be somewhat on guard as to what I say,
for I do not want to be accused of having
the United States Government cancel any
pending deal, or of interfering with the
chances of certain candidates in the provincial
election.
I want to make it clear that this is my first
opportunity to say publicly that I am not
against the aluminum project or the general
development of northern British Columbia;
neither am I against the building of the proposed railway. Just because I put up a fight
on behalf of the fisheries, and told the people
they were giving away one of their great
heritages, and should be careful, I was
accused of blocking progress.
I commend the Minister of Fisheries for his
actions. I have a great deal of sympathy
with what he has been endeavouring to do.
May I correct the impression left by the
honourable senator who sponsored this bill
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon) by saying that the agreement between the Aluminum Company of
Canada and the Department of Fisheries has
not yet been satisfactorily settled. In all
seriousness, no more hard boiled group of
businessmen have ever come into the province
of British Columbia than the aluminum people. It has taken between a year and a half
and two years to even get the officials of
this company down to the point where they
will consider allowing the passage of sufficient quantities of water to enable the sockeye salmon to go farther up the Fraser river
to spawn.
,In answer to the suggestion that the
fisheries should be preserved as a necessary
source of food supply, the position taken by
some persons has been: "What do the fish
mean? Wipe them out, and let this company
go ahead and provide more employment." It
should be noted, however, that other companies requiring smaller quantities of electrical power provide far more employment
than this company will give. Ultimately it
will develop 1,600,000 horsepower, provided
the United States government gives it further
large orders. I think it is fair to say that the
Aluminum Company of Canada is looking to
the United States Government for orders,

MAY 21. 1952
and that the future development of this project will largely depend on the extent to
which those orders are given. Power will be
produced at a cost of about one mill per
horsepower.
This company is being given the use of
one of the greatest sources of waterpower
known in the world. When the reservoir
becomes full at the end of a period of five
years, the production of power this company
-unlike that of other projects whose production fluctuates with the weather-will be
constant. When the proposed dam on the
Nechako river is completed it will prevent
the flow of water to the Fraser river; the lakes
will be built up, the power will be developed
and the water finally will empty into the
Pacific Ocean.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Will not the dam regulate
the flow of water without depleting the
streams?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No; this is a unique venture.
The dam, when completed, will be at the
easterly end of the project; the lakes will fill
up, and only the surplus water that is allowed
to spill over the dam will go into the river.
The water which builds up in the lakes will
be directed through a tunnel, dropping a considerable distance into the turbines which
are to be built in the mountains to generate
power for the manufacture of aluminum.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But where is the outlet from
the turbines?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It empties into the sea.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Has the water been going
down to the Fraser River?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, it has all been going
down to the Fraser. These lakes, particularly the large one, will therefore remain
more or less constant. Out of one of the
lakes comes the Nechako River. When it
is dammed the flow from the lakes will be
stopped, and the lakes will be joined together
and form one big water system.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Am I right in my
understanding that there are three lakes
which are to be connected by tunnels, and
that the flow from one to the other will
develop a head in the last lake, where the
dam will be? Did my honourable friend say
that the dam would be at the eastern end
of the lakes?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi:
smaller lakes.

But there

are two

Hon. Mr. Reid: They are to the westward.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: And a tunnel connects
one with the other?

Hon. Mr. Reid: They will all be joined and
form one big lake system.
In fairness to the Aluminum Company of
Canada it should be pointed out that the
turbines are being built under the mountains,
and will be protected from attack by atomic
or other bombs dropped from the air. Russia, I understand, has used this system, but
I believe it is the first of its type in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: My friend's explanation
of the flow of the water was not quite clear
to me. Is he saying that this company
proposes to divert water from the Fraser
River, where it is valuable for fisheries, and
allow it to empty into the Pacific ocean
where it is of no value from a fisheries standpoint?

Hon. Mr. Reid: That is correct. To follow
that up, the president of the company calculated the importance of his company's project on the basis of a production of 500,000
tons of aluminum per year, and compared that
to the value of the salmon products from
that area. Naturally, the comparison was
not favourable to the fisheries. I may be
regarded as old-fashioned in my thinking,
but I believe that we should not overlook
the fact that our fish are a food product
which is not unlimited, and we should therefore do our best to protect it.
Perhaps I am being too boastful, but at
least one good thing bas come out of my
agitation on behalf of fisheries-although
this has nothing to do with the powers of
the Dominion Government. The agreement
with the province would allow the Aluminum
Company of Canada to flood a forest area
comprising some fifty million feet or so
of timber, which would be utterly destroyed.
As a result of protest, however, negotiations
have been carried on between the Powell
River Pulp and Paper Company, the Aluminum
Company of Canada and the railway people,
and I believe this timber is to be salvaged.
Even when I opposed the destruction of this
timber I was accused of being opposed to
the aluminum project; and I emphasize today
that I am pleased that the provincial government has seen fit to arrange for the salvage
of what I estimate to be about fifty million
feet of merchantable timber.
I repeat, I commend the Honourable Minister of Fisheries for his efforts, and I sympathize with him in his fight with the Aluminum
Company of Canada. Indeed, a fight on
behalf of fisheries has been going on for
over two years. The company have told us
that there are no sockeye salmon in the area
affected. Of course that is -true. We never
said there were any. But when one realizes
that this development is going to cut off
80 per cent of the water that fiows from

SENATE
that district into the Fraser River, one will
readily appreciate how seriously such interference would affect the salmon which go up
the Fraser River to spawn in the lakes
above, because when they come up to spawn
they require water of a certain temperature,
and shallow water would be too warm for
any sockeye salmon to survive.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my honourable friend
say that these salmon are now sufficiently
protected?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. A final agreement has
not yet been reached. The engineers of the
International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, in co-operation with engineers of the
Dominion Fisheries Department, have been
advising the minister to enable him to inform
the company's officials as to what precautions
are necessary. It was pointed out that the fish
need a certain quantity of water, and not only
that, but water of a certain temperature. These
negotiations are not complete, although they
have been carried on for over a year and a
half.
Over a year passed before the heads of the
company would even bring themselves to discuss with the minister and the departmental
engineers what should be done. At one time
they said they would do nothing. We know
that the aluminum project will provide employment to villages and towns, perhaps for as
many as 20,000 people; and I am gladi to
say that negotiations are tending to an agreement. But an agreement has not yet been
reached, and if it should be finalized on the
basis of such information as has been provided, I doubt that what is being suggested by
the company will protect the sockeye salmon
which go to the upper reaches of the Fraser.
Last year these spawning salmon numbered
something like 2 million, representing a value
of at around $2 million a year to our fisheries
industry.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Have the departmental
officials approved the bill?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not think so. I am
coming to another point, and I have a suggestion to make. I believe it is high time that
what I am about to suggest should be carried
out.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Has the diversion of this
water in any way affected farm lands?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Up to the present no farm
has been affected, because the dams are still
in process of construction. But when they
are completed, certain agricultural lands and
some Indian properties will be flooded,. My
information is that compensation is being
offered or made or agreed upon for the settlers
who will be flooded out and the Indians who
will be compelled to move.

This brings me to the suggestion I have in
mind. We have witnessed in .the State of
Washington what can happen to the fisheries
when people give little thought to the serious
effects on fisheries resulting from the building
of dams for hydro-electric purposes. Our
commission has taken the attitude that dams
can be constructed at various points on the
Fraser River without damage to the salmon.
Bear in mind this Alcan Dam is just the beginning of hydro development in British Columbia. As I have already stated, ind.ustrialists
with millions of dollars of investment capital
are flocking into the province, and industrial
development is advancing by leaps and
bounds. The attitude of these people is more
or less like this: "What about a few fish?
Progress must go on. We want electrical
power and you need employment." Arguments
of that kind, of course, are very hard to
circumvent.
If I had time this afternoon I could demonstrate how the people of British Columbia
are being conditioned, by propaganda of all
kinds-propaganda paid for by these cornpanies, to that very way of thinking-that
progress means dams and electric-powered
industries-so why bother about a few fish?
Wipe them out. In the past two years almost
every little newspaper in the interior has
been carrying that kind of propaganda, and
I believe these power advocates also have the
support of the Vancouver press, because our
papers keep pounding on the theme, "British
Columbia needs industrial development, and
we cannot afford to pay much attention to the
men-including Tom Reid-who are talking
about fish." Recently I read an editorial
attacking me for standing in the way of progress because I have championed the fisheries
and have warned the people of British
Columbia to watch what they are giving
away. The fact that I have given this advice
does not mean that I am opposed to these
enterprises. All I demand is that the people
be fully safeguarded-and from my reading
of the agreement I am not too sure that they
are.
I know that the Dominion Government and
the Minister of Fisheries, particularly the
Minister, have been doing their best to get
the provincial authorities to co-operate. So
far, I am sorry to say, the co-operation of
the provincial government has been nil,
because they may be described as "power
mad", and as fisheries are under the control
of the dominion, apparently they mean little
or nothing to the Government of British
Columbia. When the State of Washington
was aroused to do something, it was too late:
the stable door was locked after the horse
was stolen. Washington has amended its state

MAY 21, 1952
laws to provide that before any dam can be
built the matter shall be referred to the fisheries department to ascertain what, if any,
wil be the effect of the dam on fisheries.
Although in Canada building of dams is
entirely under provincial jurisdiction4 I think
the Dominion Government should try to
induce the provincial authorities of British
Columbia to insert a similar proviso in its
statutes. Companies which intend to build
dams on the Fraser river or other watersheds
should be required to place their programs
and> their plans before the Fisheries Depairtment.
We talk a great deal about provincial
rights. I would be the last man to advocate
any limitation of those rights, but sometimes
I wonder at the attitude of provincial governments when they are handling matters of
this kind. If I may digress for a moment I
would, refer you to the Alberta Government
which has under its control the oil and gas
resources of that province. The way it exercises its responsibilities is of interest to all
of us as Canadians. Yet it might happen that
a provincial government would refuse to
allow any use of these resources for the benefit of the rest of Canada. The same consideration applies to the development of other
portions of our national heritage. In this
respect, what affects the people of British
Columbia may well affect the economy of the
people throughout the other nine provinces.
So, while I am not suggesting that the
Dominion Government should interfere with
the rigbjts of the provinces, I believe it should
give more attention to and take greater interest in what is going on in, at least, some of
our provinces.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Can the honourable
senator tell us whether it is the intention to
sell some of the power from this project, or
is all of it to be used in the manufacture of
aluminum? And is the bauxite to be manufactured at Kitimat or at Prince Rupert?
Hon. Mr. Reid: A new method has been
developed in the handling of bauxite. In the
past, aluminum has always been manufactured in Canada from bauxite brought into
this country from the West Indies and other
places. Nowadays, the countries which produce bauxite are smelting it and reducing it
into a product known as alumina. In other
words, for approximately four parts of bauxite Canada can bring in one or two parts of
alumina, and this effects a saving in freight.
This product still comes into Canada by ship,
and as far as I know there is only a sprinkling
of bauxite to be found on the continent of
North America.
As to the honourable senator's question
about electric power, it has not yet been

ascertained what will be done with it. This
company will have the exclusive rights over
the electrie power. One honourable senator
bas suggested that this electric power could
be used to operate the railroad between Terrace and Kitimat, and I think this is a matter
which could be properly discussed in
committee.
Honourable senators, it is well known that
a great cartel controls most of the companies
that manufacture sheets and other articles
from aluminum. The Aluminum Company,
realizing the profits that can be made, have
gone into the business of manufacturing sheet
products from ingots, and to a large extent
they now financially control this secondary
phase of the industry. As they have not
established any of these secondary plants
where the aluminum itself is manufactured,
I would urge the Dominion Government, if
it authorizes the building of this railroad, to
take steps to prevent these plants from being
established, say, in the United States, where
the citizens of British Columbia would not
benefit from the employment angle. I feel
that this is a reasonable request.
In connection with one of the railway bills
we passed last year, the mining company concerned made a contribution of $5 million for
the construction of a railroad, and at the same
time it stated that its mine was giving
employment to some 3,000 men. In this
instance, however, we are giving this company a great deal and not asking for anything
in return. I am going to leave what I have
to say about this until we are in committeeI suppose someone there will accuse me of
being opposed to the Aluminum Company.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That does not matter.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know, but when you get
into high places you are accused of certain
things. When I was a member of the House
of Commons the leader of the CCF party in
British Columbia said that he would like
to have me summoned before a committee of
the British Columbia Legislature which was
inquiring into the aluminum agreements.
When my name was mentioned, the Honourable Mr. Kenney referred to me at Victoria
as "that CCF member". Well, I have been
called far worse names than that. I had my
bags all packed and was looking forward to
appearing before their committee, but I was
not invited. I am not worried about what
people think of me as long as I believe that
what I say is in the best interests of all our
people. The man who stands up and fights
the people's battles must expect criticism. I
realize that it would not be safe for me to go
into the north country at the moment. Everyone there is making money and the picture
is a glowing one right now; but, to repeat
what I said before, some day somebody is

SENATE
going to stand up and curse those who signed
the Alcan agreement, because it is not in the
best interests of all the people.
When it comes to the question of electric
power, I think the Aluminum Company will
have the say as to who will get power and
who will not, and although the price may be
controlled by a board in Victoria, the Aluminum Company will be able to make it most
awkward for any company which it frowns
upon.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is the honourable senator
in favour of this railroad being built by the
Canadian National Railways?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, I am in favour of this
railroad being built as long as proper safeguards are taken. I want to know more about
the guarantee clauses. Just because I am
asking these questions I do not want to be
accused of being opposed to the construction
of this railroad. I have said nothing against
the building of the railroad, but there are
certain questions that I should like to ask
about it in committee.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would the honourable
senator be willing to say that the bulk of the
revenue of the railway will come from the
aluminum products carried by it from
Kitimat?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The railway is going to
have a wider use than the carrying of the
aluminum ingots. There is a town there of
7,000Hon. Mr. Horner: A city.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not call a place of 7,000
a city-which will require all kinds of
services. As a result of the building of this
railroad I can see other industries, perhaps
pulp and paper, being developed in the area
in which this town is situated. Like the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), I believe that some of the aluminum
may go out by water, especially if the railway
freight rates are a little higher. The Aluminum Company are not in business just to
develop industry in British Columbia; they
are out to make a profit-and I am not at
present finding fault with that.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The Canadian National
Railways must have some idea of what the
revenue-producing traffic will be, and basically
it must be aluminum. Certain developments
will follow the building of the aluminum plant,
and the railway authorities must have some
idea of the character of the traffic that will
result. Profit figures have been mentioned
with relation to this forty-six miles of railway, and they must be largely based on the
aluminum that will be carried.
Hon. Mr. Reid: For the first five years the
C.N.R. will profit by some $1,100, and it is

prophesied that this profit will be increased
to something like $300,000 over the succeeding
five years. I have no doubt that the Aluminum Company have given the assurance that
the aluminum-ingot traffic will increase to
that extent. I do not know as to that; but
at the beginning of my remarks today I did
mention that a great deal of the development
would depend upon what further contracts
the company got from the United States government. And, as I said earlier, I am trying
to be careful in my statements, for I do not
wish to interfere with their obtaining any
further contracts.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Will those large areas
of water that the company is damming
remain permanently as lakes?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, it might be good
business for the railway to suggest that they
be stocked with good fish frorn Saskatchewan.
For one thing, you would not need to worry
about competition from Japanese fishermen
there.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can good fish be got in
Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Our lakes are full of
them. We have trout up to 50 pounds, better
fish than your Sockeye salmon.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In closing I just wish to
point out that the company have been very
generously treated. They have not been in
British Columbia very long, and have
obtained rights to a valuable heritage and
now we are going to build them a railway to
facilitate their undertaking. Besides that,
even before the plant has got into operation,
the company have been allowed accelerated
depreciation of more than $70 million. So
no one can say that the federal government
and the provincial government have not
acted generously towards this company.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
NEW WESTMINSTER HARBOUR
COMMISSIONERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill 193, an Act respecting the New
Westminster Harbour Commissioners.

MAY 21, 1952
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
provides for the extension of the boundaries
of the harbour of New Westminster, and for
a loan to the harbour commissioners for the
purpose of constructing additional dockage
facilities.
The New Westminister Harbour Commissioners were incorporated by Chapter 158 of
the Statutes of 1913, and were given jurisdiction over the harbour of New Westminster
from the eastern end of Douglas Island to the
Sandheads. In 1938 the harbour was extended
to include a small area lying between the
harbour of New Westminster and the North
Fraser Harbour. In 1951 certain water-lot
properties in the Fraser river and the Pitt
river, which were formerly administered by
the Department of Resources and Development as part of the Railway Beit lands, were
transferred to the administration of the
Department of Transport. It is now proposed
to extend the boundaries of the harbour to
include these water-lots, which will be placed
under the jurisdiction of the Harbour Commissioners and be used for industrial sites in
connection with water-borne transportation.
The boundaries of the harbour would be
extended eastward in the Fraser river to
Kanaka creek, and northeastward in the Pitt
river as far as Pitt lake.
The 'bull provides for a loan of one and
one-quarter million dollars to be made to
the commissioners out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund. At the present time there
is not sufficient dookage at the Port of New
Westminster to handie the traffic, and there
is no publicby-owned wharf terminal. Five
private berths are owned and operated by
Pacifie Coast Terminal Limited. Two cityowned wharves are operated under bease 'by
private operators. On the south side of the
harbour, across the Fraser river, there are
two berths owned by Fraser Mills, and three
berths at the grain elevator leased to private
interests.
A number of shippin-g agencies have made
representations to the commissioners, pointing out the insufficiency of dock facilities
for present and future traffie requirements.
In 1946 the city was surveyed by Harland
Bartholemnes for a future town planning
scheme, including the waterfront. This survey envisaged a frontage as now piroposed,
extending eastward f-rom the present city
dock frontage to Patubo bridge. In lime with
this report, the -city wishes in time to rebease
ail interest in its waterfront property, and
with this objective in mind it has asked the
harbour commissioners to take over the most
easterly portion of its docks. For the development of additional dock frontage the city

is also prepared to convey to the Crown the
adjacent waterfront property lyirig eastward for a distance of 1,500 feet. The commissioners propose to construct dockage
facilities on this property, and have asked
for the loan for this purpose.
'In 1913 the City of New Westminster,
after having a by-law endorsed *by the
people, învested $500,000 on its ow'n docks.
So far as I know, it is the only city which
bas adopted this procedure to paovide dockage facilities for public use.
In recent years the port of New Westminster has made substantial progress, which
is reflected in the increased traffic moving
in and out of the port. In 1951 the port
handled 394 deep sea ships, with a total
tonnage of 936,320.
Besides, there were
1,926 coastal vessels, which carried a freight
of more than 2 million tons. Trade to ail
countries is on the increase. It has jumped
very considerabby this year, and the port
is looking forward to a renewal of business
with ships from Japan, Germany and other
countries.
The exports from the port are chiefly lumber, apples and metals. About 500 million
feet of bumber are shipped out of there every
year.
United States defence authorities consider
that this port, in view of its rail connections
to the United States points via the Great
Northern, Northern Pacific and other Amenican railroads, would be a bogical operating
point for defence shipments.
With the major industrial development
now proceeding in British Columbia and
the adjoining province of Alberta, it is essential that adequate deep-sea dock facibities be
constructed to take cane of traffic moving
in and out of the port of New Westminster.
At present the commissioners have outstanding a boan of $974,000 fnom the government, which loan was made many yeans ago
to provide money for an elevator.
Hou. Mr. Duff: Is that $974 thousand or
$974 million?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is $974,000. The intenest
on this loan has abways been paid. True,
during a few of the war years shipping out
of the port dropped, and they went behind
on the interest; however, this has since been
paid up.
The new loan is for $1,250,000. 1 would
suggest that after the bibi has been given
second reading it should be referred to a
committee where the details can be fubby
discussed.

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
COMPENSATION BILL
SECOND READING

Han. Gardon B. Isnor moved, the second
reading o! Bill 195, an Act te amend the
Government Employees Compensation Act,
1947.
He said: Honcurable senators, I was very
pleased hast evening when it was suggested
by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) that I move the second reading
of this bill. I say that because cf my experience with certain provisions cf the Government Employees Compensation Act passed in
1918 and as amended in 1931 and 1951.
Durîng the war years, in 1942 or 1943, 1

SENATE
as are those in Ontario or in the Western

all provinces a uniform interpretation with
respect to diseases for which compensation
may be received. The new section 8, as contained in the bill, reads as follows:
The governor in council may make regulations
prescribing the conditions under which compensation is to be payable, the amount of compensation
payable and the manner in which the compensation
is to be determined, in respect of any employee
who is disabled or whose death is caused by reason
of any disease that is not an industrial disease but
is due to the naturé of his employment and peculiar
to or characteristic of the particular process, trade
or occupation in which he was employed at the
time the disease was contracted, and compensation
shall be awarded to such employee or to the
dependents of such deceased employee in accordance with the regulations.

That, honourable senators is the explanation
of the amendment contained in this bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is it intended that this bill
should be referred to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: As this measure is merely
an extension of one of the sections of the
Act, I had not thought it necessary to move
that it be referred to committee, subject, of
course, to any request that it be so referred.

Hon. Mr. Vien: Third reading at the next
sitting of the house.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Next sitting.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that when the house adjourns today
it do stand adjourned until Monday, May 26,
at 8 o'clock in the evening. I do this because,
the Orders of the Day having been disposed of,
I know of no public interest which will suffer
as a consequence of such adjournment. Consideration of the Criminal Law bill is well in
hand: the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce are giving it most detailed
examination.
Next Monday evening it is my intention,
unless something unforeseen should intervene,
to go ahead with motion No. 3, respecting the
continuation of certain sections of the Emergency Powers Act. The following day the
deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will move
Motion No. 2, to approve The Supplementary
Extradition Convention and I hope that the
honourable senators who have undertaken the
responsibility of moving the two other motions
will proceed with them as soon as they conveniently can.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, May
26, at 8 p.m.

of Canada, in

praying that the Consumer Credit (Temporary

and fifty-four.
He said: Honourable senators, this Act
which is now to be extended, was passed in
1950, being Chapter 3 of the Statutes of that
year. Perhaps I should read the preamble:

Whereas
in the preamble to the Essential
Materials (Defence) Act it is recited that in order
to avert possible disruption of the defence preparations therein referred to, to lessen the resultant
disruption of normal trade and commerce and to
prevent economic disorder and hardship on a
national scale, it is essential in the interest of
Canada as a whole to provide for the control and
regulation of the production, distribution and use
of the materials and services therein referred to;
and such defence preparations may be expected to
expand purchasing power and the demand for consumer goods, and at the same time limit the quantity of consumer goods available for ordinary or
civilian requirements; and it may therefore be
necessary, as a further measure to counteract
possible adverse effects of these developments upon
such defence preparations, normal trade and commerce and the economic life of the nation, to take
steps to restrain the expansion of purchasing power
and the demand for consumer goods by preventing
55708-21

The situation with respect to consumer credit is
now such that I believe we can safely suspend the
operation of these regulations. However, if conditions made it necessary, I would have no hesitation in recommending the reintroduction of consumer credit controls, and in view of existing
uncertainties I believe the present legislative basis
for such control should be maintained. For this
reason the government will invite both houses of
parliament to present addresses to the governor
general praying that the Consumer Credit (Temporary Provisions) Act be continued for a further
period.

The motion I have moved would extend
the Act for two years. If honourable senators
agree that the measure as originally passed
was justified, its extension at this time for
a further two years is justified. There is
nothing in present conditions to assure us
that anything will or will not happen. None
of us relish the idea of restrictions of this
kind, unless they are necessary; but as long
as the present government is entrusted with
authority power, and conditions continue as
they are, it seems only sensible that it should
not be hampered in using its judgment to
meet any unforeseen circumstances which
may arise.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator whether the extension of the
Consumer Credit Act is for the purpose of
preventing a further fall in the purchasing
power of the Canadian dollar, or is it to give
the government priority in obtaining goods
for manufactures which are needed for
defence purposes?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I suppose that it is for
any purpose which, in the light of the object
for which this measure was enacted, the government may think justified. It might be
either one or both of the purposes the honourable senator has mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Any others?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Or any others.
Hon. Thomas Reid: I do not suppose that
any law has ever been placed on the statute
books in which someone has not tried to find
a loophole. While I commend the extension
of this measure, I wonder whether any consideration has been given by the government
to a practice which, whether nation-wide or
not, has gone on quite extensively in the
province from which I come. In order to
evade the restrictions imposed by the Act,
some merchants have advertised that on
receipt of any old cup a customer would be
allowed a credit of $100 on the article advertised. I have seen such notices in the Vancouver daily papers relating to various types
of merchandise, for instance Frigidaires and
other household goods. In effect, these merchants said, "Bring around any old cup and
saucer, whatever its value, and we will credit
you with $100". In so doing, these advertisers, while endeavouring to keep within the
law, were also taking advantage of competitors. I do not say they were unscrupulous,
but it seems that they were unfair and
attempting to evade the purpose of the Act.
I suggest that something should be donc to
prevent this kind of thing.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Assuming that my honourable friend is asking a question, I will say
I am sure that, when occasion arises to renew
the Act, the minister will greatly appreciate
having his attention called to this matter.
From what I have seen of the success with
which one hole after another in income tax
law has been plugged, I have no doubt the
government will be able to plug this one as
well.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not rise to oppose
the motion, but I must admit an innate disposition to oppose legislation which interferes,
especially wi.thin the country, with freedom
of trade. Last May, when I went with a
friend of mine to Montreal to take delivery
of a car, I was told that as a consequence of
this legislation, over five hundred British
automobiles which had been landed in Canada

were being returned to the Old Country, with
a loss to the British manufacturers of the cost
of transport both ways. What we lost-and this
is the point I am making: I am not discussing
the interests of the British manufacturer
or the British people-was the prospective market for our goods which the sale
price of those five hundred cars would have
provided. You may say that is not very much,
but all these little things "make a muckle".
As far as these credit restrictions are concerned, I can see no difference between today
and a year ago. The minister tried to point
out that the cost of living had gone down a
little; but honourable senators will realize that
this is true only to the extent of the loss
suffered by the farmers as a result of the
hoof-and-mouth disease which broke out in
Saskatchewan in February. Had there been
no such disease there would have been no
drop in the market at all. The cost of meat
products, which forms a large item in the
cost of living, has gone down. Canada is now
making a meat deal on which we are paying
out 25 cents a pound. I am not criticizing this,
and I think that under the circumstances it is
a wise move.
My point is that I do not believe credit
restrictions are being taken off because there
is any real downward trend in our cost of
living. On the other hand, it can be said that
takes have substantially increased, and that
Canadians are paying tremendously high
taxes on municipal, provincial and federal
levels. I believe that the tax situation is
worse than it was a year ago. Therefore, if
there was reason to impose credit restrictions
a year ago there is every reason for maintaining them now. Why are the credit restrictions being taken off? I listened to the speech
made by the minister in the other house, but
he offered no reason for removing them.
There is no reason for taking them off.
As a matter of fact, there never was any
reason for putting them on.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) need not think that
the merchants of his city are the only ones
who can play fast and loose with the law. I
think he would find that the same thing is
going on in Winnipeg, Toronto, Halifax, Victoria, Regina, Saskatoon, and other cities
across the dominion.
Hon. Mr.
Vancouver.

Farris:

You

out

Hon. Mr. Haig: Because the honourable
gentleman named Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, New Westminster.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was just pointing out the
places where unscrupulous merchants live.

May 26. 1952
If my honourabie friend is hurt because I did
flot include Vancouver, I can easily do Sa.
The thing I cannot understand is that the
party wh.ich has been imposing ail these trade
restrictions ini recent years is the Liberai
party. These are the same people who, since
the time I wa-s a boy, have always accused
the Conservatives of following the policy of
imposing trade restrictions. Here is a restriction which says I cannot purchase a washing
machine unless I pay one-third down. I suppose I do not think any more of my wife
than my colleagues think -of their wives, but
I would hate to, see my wife washing clothes
by hand on a wash-board the way my mother
used to do. Why shou.ld my wife be pen.alized
if I arn too poor to finance a one-third downpayment on a washing machine, or on an
electric stove a gas stave, or a Frigidaire?
I think I told you this story before, but
perhaps I did not. A lady fram Miami,
Manitoba, who came into Winnipeg to attend
a ýrovincia1 meeting of a church, visited our
home. My wif e with very great pleasure
displayed ber new washing machine, and ber
late model Frigidaire and electric stove, and
explained how they ail worked. The visitor,
who was a very smart woman, said III think
they are very nice indeed, Mrs. Haig. 1 have
the same kind at home." Now, why should
she not have the same kind? But if these
restrictions are imposed the average young
f amily just starting out has not enough
money to buy these things. Maybe it is a
mistake to extend credit freely; maybe that
does resuit in putting a false price on many
goods; but still I do not think we should
interfere.
1 was surprised when from my seat in a
gallery of another place I heard the Minister
of Finance say he was going ta ask for an
extension of this A*ct. I seriously suggest
that unless we have war with Russia this
Act will neyer be used again. One experience was enough, and the government will
not wish to repeat it. This request for an
extension of the Act may be a nice facesaving procedure, but I repeat my belief that
the Act will not be enforced again unless, as
I say, war breaks out with Russia-a condition that I attach ta every forecast I make.
Mon. Mr. Hugessen: Sa does the gaverfiment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the Act is useless,
and that the request for its extension is
merely a pretence at doing somethlng to
bring down taxes and the cost of living. We
ail know that the proposed extension will not
have this effect, and that it probably will
only resuit in causing dealers in some British
or French goods ta get caught, as they have
55708-21à

got caught i the past, with a lot of stock
an hand, which wiil have ta be sent back
where it came from.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourabie
senators, I have iistened with a good deal of
interest ta the statement of the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) that this legisiation
has been ineffective in the past and is not
likely ta be invoked in future, unless we
have war with Russia. I wouid point out ta
him that in the troubled and uncertain times
in which we are living, wars nat specifically
proved ta be or designed as wars with
Russia have had an effect upon the economy
of this country very closely apprqximating
the effect of total war. As an instance of
what I mean I cite the outbreak of hostilities
in Korea.
My friend referred ta the restrictions that
have been imposed from time ta time since
the World War II, and says that their removai
has not been rapîd enough to be consistent
with Liberai principies. My own general
view bas been that aur experience during
the period of total war and the subsequent
period when we were recavering from the
effects of that tremendous struggie, combined
with the situation that we faced on the outbreak of war in Korea, which led ta a widespread public feeling that it was desirabie
ta build up a stock of arms and other equipment against the unknown future, ail created
a condition which wouid have caused any
government, no matter what its political
traditions, ta feel itself in duty bound ta take
what appeared ta be reasonable precautions
ta protect the purchasing power and the
standard of living of the people. Among the
steps that were taken was the bringing into
force of this Act and the passing of regulations under it.
My honourable friend said the Act was
not necessary when It was passed, and that
the conditions which existed then were no
different from those exlsting now. I suggest
ta hlm. that that statement is not correct.
He referred ta credit restrictions on the
purchase of a variety of goods, particuiarly
automobiles. Now, the retailing of automobiles and motor trucks is a business of which I
have some knowledge, for almost the whoie
of my aduit life prior ta the assumption of
my present responsibilities was spent li that
business. My experlence li It dates back
ta just before the First Great War. lIn common with ail those engaged li the business I
found gradually Increasing sales, which
reached their peak in 1929 and 1930, just
prior ta the great depressiori. As I listened
ta he senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) and the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig), xny mmnd went back ta the unfortuxiate circumstances li whlch, purveyors as

SENATE
well as purchasers of motor cars and trucks
found themselves during 1929 and the next
few years, because of the large number of
vehicles that had been sold on credit. It
is interesting to note that just prior to 1929
the maximum terms of credit were one-third
down and the balance within twelve months.
It was rumoured at that time that some
people, in their desire to make sales, were
extending credit terms even up to eighteen
months. Soon after that, as honourable
senators remember, unfortunate circumstances arose and spread throughout the
whole structure of the automobile business;
indeed, there were very few purveyors of
cars, or of any products related to that business, who were not on the verge of bankruptcy. The purchasers of automobiles whose
payments extended over a period of twelve
months, and in some cases eighteen months,
found themselves unable to continue the
payments, and their equities disappeared.
I am as certain as I am that the sun will
rise and set, that if prior to the economic
crash of 1929 some authority had exercised
control over the extension of credit on all
items, both in Canada and elsewhere, the
severity of the depression would have been
greatly minimized. True, everybody wants
freedom to satisfy his own desires. But I, as
one engaged in the automotive business, would
have preferred to have some authority step
in and police my freedom of action and that
of my competitors. Such intervention would
have been good for me and for my competitors,
and in the final analysis the purchaser would
not have lost all lie had.
When this Act and the regulations thereunder came into force, an unprecedented
extension of credit in one form or another
had developed in Canada. This alarming
situation applied not only to the automobile
business, but to the house-furnishing business
and many others. Heartbreaking appeals, such
as the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has just made, were put forward, and
the suggestion was made that it was unfair
to restrict young people who, in blissful
ignorance of the consequences, were mortgaging their futures. We may never know how
many young people, as a consequence of the
restrictions which this legislation imposed,
were saved from creating for themselves
intolerable financial burdens.
The leader opposite brought up the rather
remote argument that this credit restriction
legislation caused the return of some five
hundred English cars to the Old Country,
with a resultant loss to us of a market there.
It is of course inevitable that with the imposition of credit restrictions some people will
not be able to buy cars; but that is true of
Canadian and American cars, as well as of

those manufactured in England.
some personal knowledge of the subject, for
the business in which I was interested, and
which I have now disposed of, had an
agency for English cars in Nova Scotia. At
the time of which I speak the public in
Great Britain had been denied the right
to purchase cars because of an attempt on
the part of their government to stimulate
export trade. Consequently, many of the
shippers fromn the Old Country lost no time
in taking back the unsold automobiles, to
be disposed of in ready markets elsewhere.
Further,-and this is typical of other lines
of business as well as the automobile industry-I was amazed to learn how much of
credit was being carried under the long term
agreements.
I concede to the honourable leader opposite that such legislation as this does curtail
of the rights and privileges of persons to
mortgage their futures. But such restrictions have come out of the extraordin'ary
conditions of war and post-war years. For
my part, I believe that when the history of
Canada is written, and a proper perspective
is gained, it will be obvious that the government of which I am a member, in its exercise of controls during the war and postwar years-controls which the United States
and other countries in the western world
have to a more or less extent exercisedhas rendered a great service to the people
of this country. It will also then be apparrent that much of the expansion of our economy can be attributed to the foresight and
courage displayed by the government during those troubled and uncertain years.
There may be instances, such as the leader
opposite mentioned, in which our evasion of
the rules bas been attempted by some business people; there may also be cases such
as were indicated by my honourable friend
from New Westminster, (Hon. Mr. Reid),
when honest men who played the game
were placed at a disadvantage by the actions
of "chisellers."
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has pointed out that
if circumstances make it necessary the government may exercise its judgment in reimposing credit restrictions. The basic principle is that the present government has
assumed responsibility for the general health
of the economy of this country, and this it has
done successfully. Whether or not circumstances will make it necessary to invoke
restrictions during the period for which this
motion would extend the Act, I do not know;
but if circumstances make a change necessary, and the government devises and carries out the regulations as fairly and successfully as it has in the past, we will have

May 26. 1952
nothing to fear for the future of our economic
development.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: I have already asked
the mover of this resolution whether the
extension of these powers is for the purpose
of protecting the Canadian dollar from a
further faîl in purchasing power or is
designed to obtain for the government a
priority in the purchase of goods for war
purposes. The answer was, either. But it
seems to me, if I may be permitted to answer
my own question, that the purpose is the
first, flot the second, because the government
has other means of giving itself priority in
the obtaining of goods; and so far as I know
it is encountering no difficulties in that direction. The real purpose of giving this power
to the executive is the protection of the
Canadian dollar from a f urther decline in
purchasing power; and it seems to me that
the subi ect again brings up the inquiry,
how long will it be before this and other
nations get back to honest money?
There was a time when we in Canada, and
the people of Great Britain and of other
places, had a dollar or other currency unit
which was intrinsically worth what its face
betokened. In my young days the British
pound was regarded as, to use a common
expression "safe as the Bank of England".
It was reliable because British money at that
time was a promise to pay something whose
intrinsic value was the exact equivalent of
the promise to pay. So meticulous were the
English people in days gone by that their
money should be honest money-a promise to
actually pay something which was worth
something-that they even paid out of the
public treasury the cost of the printing or the
minting of money. The promise it involved
of delivery of gold upon demand was the
promise of the exact equivalent on the market
of the face value of the unit of purchasing
power. Undoubtedly that condition would
have continued indefinitely both here and
there, had it not been for the outbreak of
war in 1914, and the change in the character
of war which then occurred. Previously wars
were f ought by champions, men who, at least
in England, enlisted voluntarily, and who,
because their numbers were not so great, were
supported without much inconvenience by the
industry of those who stayed at home. But
beginning in 1914 a completely new type of
war was evolved,-a war, not of champions,
but of nations. The whole of the national
economy in Canada and in Great Britain was
devoted to one purpose, the winning of the
war, and-I suppose, inevitably-the method
of financing was very largely a series of
promises to pay. We commenced the war
of 1914 with the issue of promises to pay
gold. But so great was the volume of our

promises that the possibility of fulfllling themn

abolished the honest money of previous days
and resorted to the kind of money which. we
and ail other nations have adopted; that is to
say, an irredeemiable paper currency, backed
with nothing but an effervescent, intangible
promise of governiments.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Confidence.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Just confidence, that is
ail. We adopted the most dishonest f ormi of
money that there is, because, nowadays the
money of ail nations, including our own has no
substantial ba*cking; and as the honourable
senator fromn New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) has remarked, it depends for its value
upon sentiment, upon the confidence of people;
and as soon as that confidence dilsappears,
so aiso does the value of the nioney. The
result is that the purchasing power of this
money decreases. The promises made at the
beginning of the war of 1914, then to be
redeemed in .gold, are now worth perhaps
one-haif what they were worth when gîven
-that approximation is good enough for the
purpose of thîs thought-and 1 suppose that
is the only thing that could have been done
at the time, because had we continued to
promise g.old we would have failed in our
undertaking and something akin to bankruptcy
would have resulted.
So, from that time to this-except for a
short period in England, but not, I believe,
here-this irredeemable and valueless paper
money has been used; and it was for the purpose of safeguarding that insubstantial f ormi
of currency that these restrictions-which the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) does not like, neither do I,
and to which ahl kin&s of objections, such as
those mentioned by the honourable senator
from. Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) apply-were
enacted.
Our action in passing this legislation today
is not purposeless; it is to preserve, if we can,
the sentimental regard we hold for the form
of money which is now fioating in tremendous
quantities in our economy. Our action in the
first instance was by no means without purpose, and it is by no ineans without -purpose
that we extend that power -today.
My honourable friend from Shelburne <Hon..
Mr. Robertson) speaks of the difficulties whlch
face the automobile industry because of the
tremendous credits which are fioating about.
0f course that industry is but one of many
wherein goods were sold on promises to pay,
and promises to pay in this insubstantial
money which *we use. It must be realized
that while there are many forms of money,
ail of them are based upon promises to, pay.
There is the currency issued by governments,

SENATE
promises to pay which pass from hand to
hand; there are also promissory notes from
one individual to another, which pass from
hand to hand and perform almost the same
function as does a dollar bill.
When considering the insubstantiality of
our money, the credits that are out must be
added to the promises of government. It was
to save our money that these restrictions on
the volume of credit were imposed, by parliament. I realize that we would ruin our
economy were we to return to the gold
standard, and thus place it on the basis of
previous standards of value. This was tried
in England prior to the great strike, when
those who ostensibly were endeavouring to
save the pound even dragged the King into
the effort. A disastrous strike followedi, and
the country failed to return to the gold standard. The effort failed because the standard
was placed at too high a level. This had the
effect of increasing the weight of all
obligations and liabilities, and the rate of
recurring charges-rents and interest-increased to such an extent that businesses
could not carry out the promises they had
made to pay. This brought about an economic
stagnation in England and resulted in the
falling of true wages, and, as I said, there
was a disastrous and dangerous strike. If we
were to return, to honest money-money
which promises to pay something of intrinsic value-and place that value too highly,
we would ruin business after business and
disrupt the entire economy of this country.
If, on the other hand, we were to return to
money which promises something of intrinsic
value and based it on the level of the true
value of the money which is now out, we
would then give our money such a substantiality that we would not have to take these
precautions to save it from utter decay.
I mention these simple facts because it is
time that those responsible for the actions of
parliament, and: thinkers generally in Canada, began to consider whether.it is not time
to change from these precarious promises to
pay without backing to promises to pay
which have intrinsic value. Then we could
return to what I have dubbed honest money,
money which the private citizen could be sure
would represent the same value today as it
dic yesterday and that it would tomorrow.
If I borrow $100 of money today with which
to buy, say, a horse, and I find in three or
four months' time that the money has gone
up so that it takes two or three horses to
redeem the pledge, or, on the other hand, has
gone down so that half a horse will redeem the
pledge, that is dishonest. That is the kind of
money which is fioating around this country.

What we require for the substantial carrying on of business is a dollar which has the
same purchasing value when it is borrowed
as it has a little later when it is paid back.
I know of no business requirement so great
as financial stability; but we do not enjoy
such a thing in this country at the present
time. As I say, the time is coming, if it is not
already here, when you and I should be
thinking carefully about whether we cannot
abandon these promises which are valuable
today, less valuable tomorrow and perhaps
of no value at all in a short time. Let us
return to money which is honest and substantial, and in which men can be confident,
money such as we had before the Great War
of 1914.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. W. Stambaugh: Honourable senators, I have listened to this rather amusing
description of our sentimental, insubstantial
dollar. I come from a province where I have
listened to this kind of talk for quite a few
years-that our dollar is of no value.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Well, practically. You
said that it is insubstantial and dishonest, and
that it has no actual value. I have heard
people at meetings in Alberta say that our
dollar isn't worth the paper it is written on,
and then I have seen them take up a collection and tell you not to put in just a nickel
but something really substantial, a dollar bill
or perhaps a ten dollar bill.
Either I arn "off the beam" or my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) is, because I have just returned
from a week-end in the United States, where
I found businessmen extremely anxious to
get hold of some of these sentimental dollars
of ours-and this is the first time that I have
ever seen this situation. When I tried to
make a certain purchase in the United States
a few years ago the clerk called up the bank,
and there was a demand for a 17 per cent
discount. Today, however, American businessmen are quite prepared to take our Canadian dollars on a parity with their own. There
must be a lot of foolish people in the world
today, because bankers, businessmen and governments the world over are anxious to get
our Canadian dollars-these sentimental,
insubstantial dishonest dollars. I think the
main reason they are anxious to get them is
that they are substantial and really worth
something. The productive capacity of our
people and the natural resources of our country are behind our dollars, and I do not
believe there is another country in the world
where, man for man, the productive capacity
and the natural resources per capita can
match those of Canada. Legislation such as

May 26, 1952
the government is bringing in now bas been
largely responsible for our present favourable
dollar position.
It has been said that these credit restrictions have been of no benefit, and that they
have accomplished nothing. Why was it,
then, that automobile dealers put the pressure on the government to remove these
They claimed that because of
restrictions?
them they could not sell their automobiles.
I read a newspaper report which said the
Prime Minister had been asked if his wife
had a washing machine, and which stated
that poor people could not buy washing
machines because of the credit restrictions.
Well, we know that since the credit restrictions were removed there have been more
washing machines sold, and that the cost of
living went down to some extent before they
were removed. True, a good deal of the
reduction came about because farm products,
especially beef, and to some extent pork, fowl
and cheese, have been cheaper. Certain
example,
commodities-for
manufactured
clothing and furniture-are cheaper too; and
electrical washing machines, refrigerators,
and many other articles of household equipment; are considerably cheaper. All these
goods enter into the cost of living, so there
is a reason for taking off the restrictions;
and in the future there may be a reason for
putting them back on. Although it is true
-that a dollar will not buy as much today as
it would in times past, we have more dollars
now, and most of us would not mind having
still more.
My chief reason for rising to speak this
evening was to take issue with the statement
that we so often hear nowadays, that the
extent to which the value of our dollar has
fallen is proof of the need to change of our
whole financial policy. Well, I think the
financial policy of this country has been
pretty good, and I should like to hold the
line just about where it is. If the taking of
some such action as is now proposed will
help us to hold the line, I am all for it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to say a few words, not
in speaking to the motion but by way of
a brief explanation? I have been advised
that this motion, which is being considered
concurrently in the other house, has been
amended by substituting "1953" for "1954".
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am not questioning
the information I have received, but I think
in the circumstances the proper procedure
for me would be to ask the Whip (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) to move adjournment of the debate,
and to bring the matter before the house
tomorrow.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I move adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

CANADIAN FORCES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 224, an Act respecting
the Canadian Forces.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
largely technical in its nature and does not
involve substantial changes in policy. It
provides for amendments to the National
Defence Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Act,
and the Senate and House of Commons Act.
As indicated in the explanatory notes, in
title and form this bill follows the precedent
set by the Canadian Forces Act, 1950, and the
Canadian Forces Act, 1951.

SENATE
The amendments to the National Defence
Act deal with technical changes in the field
of discipline and administration that the services consider necessary from an administrative point of view, and are designed to ensure
that the National Defence Act, passed by
parliament in 1950, will continue to meet
the developing requirements of the services.
As the amendments proposed to that Act fall
mainly into the category of service discipline
and are not of major consequence from a
policy point of view, it might perhaps be
preferable to defer detailed discussion of
them until the bill is considered in committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: However, honourable
senators, I will refer to one or two of the
major changes. The Canadian Forces Act,
1951, contained an amendment to the Civil
Service Superannuation Act to enable civil
servants who were formerly members of the
navy, with service ashore overseas in the
Second World War, to count their period of
active service on the same basis as former
members of the army and air force. It has
been found, however, that certain former
members of the navy could not elect to take
the benefit of that provision by reason of the
fact that the time within which they might
so elect had expired when the amendment
was passed. Accordingly, it is desirable that
an appropriate time for election should be
allowed in these cases.
The bill also contains an amendment to
the Civil Service Superannuation Act, which
would remove the existing inequity and would
enable approximately thirty civil servants,
whose elections were refused under the 1951
amendments, to add their naval service to
the time spent in the civil service.
The clauses in the bill to amend the Defence
Services Pension Act deal with retired officers
who are pensioned and who have taken
employment in the civil service. The bill
also provides the basis upon which members
of the regular forces may count their reserve
service. With regard to retired officers who
take a position in the civil service, present
regulations provide that such officers may
receive by way of service pension only an
amount which, when added to their civil
service salary does not bring their total
emoluments above the level of their pay and
allowances upon their retirement from the
forces. The proposed amendment would
allow these retired officers now in the civil
service, to receive the difference between
their civil service pay and the pay of their
rank as it then is, thus enabling them to

secure the advantage of any increases in
military pay subsequent to their retirement.
This would be achieved by providing that
such civil servants could receive by way of
service pension an amount which, when added
to their civil service salary, does not bring
their total emoluments above the current
pay and allowances of the rank in which they
were retired. In effect, a new ceiling would
be created, namely, the pay and allowances
of the forces in effect from time to time as
against the pay and allowances in effect upon
retirement.
The bill also includes an amendment to the
Senate and House of Commons Act to make
the language relating to the eligibility of
members of the forces to sit in the House of
Commons consistent with current defence
phraseology. This amendment is substantially
the same as an amendment to the Canada
Elections Act, passed in 1951, dealing with the
right of servicemen to be elected to the House
of Commons.
As I have indicated, honourable senators,
the bill is largely of a technical nature; most
of the matters dealt with being of importance
from the standpoint of service administration.
When the bill was first presented in the
other place it contained provisions to make it
possible for the government to fulfill its
obligations under the Geneva Conventions
respecting the trial and punishment of persons
alleged to have committed offences against
prisoners of war and others. As those conventions have not yet been ratified by Canada, the
relevant provisions of the bill were deleted.
When this bill has been given second reading by the house, I intend to move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, I do
not intend to debate the bill at this time. I
am not sufficiently expert on the subject to
speak on it intelligently. Therefore, I should
like to reserve the right to express myself on
the measure after it has been fufly discussed
in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

55708-22

SENATE
The convention which the resolution puts
before the house is the greatest step yet taken
by the United Nations towards the abolition
of the law of the jungle. In my judgment it
ranks in importance in the matter of international law with the principles enunciated
at the famous Nuremberg trials, where, for
the first time, an international prohibition was
imposed on crimes against humanity. This
is the second major step in promulgating the
recognition and prevention of international
crimes.
I suppose the first thing I should do in
endeavouring to explain this resolution is to
define the terni "genocide", because it will
not be found in the dictionary. It is a new
name for a very old crime-the crime of
barbarity. It is an invented word, made up
of two ancient words: the Greek genos, meaning a clan or religious group; and the Latin
cide, meaning to kill or killing. The two
together mean -the killing of a clan or
religious group. The word was invented by
Raphiel Lemkin, a former Polish national
whose family of forty-nine relatives, including
his mother and father, was wiped out in one
of the Russian pogroms. More recently Mr.
Lemkin served on the United States prosecution staff at Nuremberg. He is the world's
foremost advocalte of the subject matter of
the resolution which is before us this afternoon. He had more to do than any other
single person with the carrying of this convention unanimously, by a vote of 55-0, in
the United Nations General Assembly at
Paris on December 9, 1948.
I have given -the house the derivation of the
word, but its technical meaning is described
in the convention itself, Article Il of which
defines genocide as follows:
In the present Convention, genocide means any
of the following acts committed with intent to
destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnical,
racial or religious group, as such:
(a) Killing members of the group;
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to
members of the group;
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical
destruction in whole or in part;
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births
within the group;
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to
another group.

That took place, by the way, in Greece,
when some thousands of Greek children
were driven across the border behind the
Iron Curtain.
It will be observed that the crime consists of acts with intent to destroy in whole
or in part any national, ethnical, racial or
religious group; and the definition sets out
the means that may be employed to that
end. Article III declares that the following

acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide; (b)
conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) direct and
public incitement to commit genocide; (d)
attempts to commit genocide, and (e) complicity in genocide.
Then I think this will appeal to all men
here. In order to ensure that the holding
of high office shall grant no immunity, or no
more than the resolution can prevent from
being granted, article IV provides:
Persons committing genocide or any of the acts
enumerated in Article III shall be punished, whether
they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public
officials or private individuals.

So far, what I have been reading might be
described as the law-making portion of the
convention. I do not think I should trespass
upon the time of the house by reading the
whole convention, but I feel that it should
be placed on record. May I therefore ask
that the convention, together with a list of
the nations which have signed it, and of
those which have already ratified it, be
printed as an appendix to the Hansardreport
of this sitting?
(Sec appendix at end of today's report.)
The convention provides that it shall come
into force on the nineteenth day following
the deposit of the twentieth instrument of
ratification or accession, and this has been
understood to mean without reservation in
any particular on the part of the ratifying
state. This goal was reached on the 12th of
January, 1951. Representatives of the Canadian government had signed on the 28th of
November, 1949, but ratification was delayed
by the Parliament of Canada pending a judgment by the International Court of Justice
on a relevant point of law.
Seven states have ratified with reservations
as to Article IX of the convention. If you
will permit me, I shall read that article:
Disputes between the Contracting Parties relating
to the interpretation, application or fulfilment of
the present Convention, including those relating to
the responsibility of a State for genocide or for
any of the other acts enumerated in Article III,
shall be submitted to the International Court of
Justice at the request of any of the parties to the
dispute.

As honourable senators know Russia and
her satellites, have always refused compulsory submission to the International Court
of charges against themselves. So we find
substantially identical reservations by these
nations: Byelorussia, Ukraine, U.S.S.R., Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Roumania
and-all countries behind the iron cu-rtainViet-Nam and, curiously enough, the Philippine Republic. If Canada ratifies the convention, as I hope she will, we cannot call
upon any of those countries to submit to
the International Court of Justice, nor can

MAY 27, 1952
any one of them call upon us to submit to
the judgment of the Court; however, we
can both sue and be sued by the thirty countries which have to date ratified without
reservation. As for the countries behind the
iron curtain I think we can forget about them
with a clear conscience and without much
regret.
In Article V the contracting parties undertake to enact-and note this language-in
accordance with their respective constitutions the necessary legislation to give effect
to the provisions of the convention, and to
provide effective penalties for persons guilty
of genocide and its associated crimes. So
far as Canada is concerned, this is simple
procedure, for there is on file a letter from
the Deputy Minister of Justice, Mr. Varcoe,
stating that Canada has already on its stattite books the prohibitions necessary to the
implementation of the convention, and, further, containing this statement:
I cannot conceive of any act of commission or

omission occurring in Canada as falling within the
definition of the Crime of Genocide in Article Il of
the Convention, that would not be covered by the
relevant section of the Criminal Code.

Therefore, we need not be worried about that
feature of the convention. Mr. Varcoe is
also of opinion that any legislation necessary to implement this convention falls within the jurisdiction of the federal parliament,
and does not in any way impinge upon provincial jurisdiction. However that may be,
we have assurance from the highest legal
authority in the land that the convention is
already implicated in the law of Canada.
There was forced upon the drafters of the
Convention a somewhat unsatisfactory compromise, namely, that, according to Article
VI, persons charged with genocide or any
of its associate offences, such as conspiring,
inciting and attempting . . . I quote:

. . . shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the
State in the territory of which the act was committed, or of such international penal tribunal as
may have jurisdiction with respect to those Contracting Parties which shall have accepted its
jurisdiction.

In view, honourable senators, of the possibility that for years there will not be
any international tribunal with penal or
criminal jurisdiction, it follows logically from
that article that in practice only private
individuals may be prosecuted for the crime
of genocide, and that they must be
prosecuted according to the laws of the
state in which they live or in which the
crime is committed. The governments in
most countries are not likely to submit their
acts to the judgment of their own courts,
nor are they likely to submit to those courts
the question of the guilt of their high officials,
55708-22J

whose criminal acts may have been in
accordance with government policy.
The truth is that this c'onvention lacks
teeth. In some of the writings that I have
read it has been described as a mere gesture.
But it is of course much more than that.
It is a solemn declaration by thirty-eight
countries of the world that genocide-by
whomsoever committed, including heads of
state-is a crime that ought to be punished,
although the machinery for punishment under
certain circumstances is for the moment in
abeyance. I believe that in time the ratifying
countries of the world will find and adopt
better methods of enforcement, as circumstances make such action necessary. There
is a weakness in the convention as it now
stands, but it is not by any means hopeless.
The important point at the moment is
that the participating nations of the wo'rld
are agreed that attacks upon national, ethnical
or religious groups, as such, with intent to
destroy in whole or in part, are international
crimes, and no longer a matter of mere
internal or domestic concern, and that they
should be punished. This, in my opinion, is
a long step forward in the development of
world-wide moral precept and practice.
One of the worst crimes in history, which
would have been covered by this convention
had it been in force at the time, was the
murder of the population of Carthage by the
Romans. It was not, of course, the first crime
of genocide. But nothing is to be gained by
going back into very ancient history. The
slaughter of the Carthagirians is not, however, in its effect upon modern times, ancient
history. Honourable senators will no doubt
remember the iterated and reiterated demand
of Cato the Elder in the Roman Senate,
"Carthage must be destroyed", and unfortunately his incitements were all too successful.
The destruction of Carthage removed the
intellectual competition in the Mediterranean
which its preservation would have promoted,
and as a result, in my judgment, the world
is the poorer, even to this day.
One shudders even now when reading of
the slaughter of 10 million people by the
Mongols. Jenghiz Khan boasted that he could
ride his horse without stumbling over the
ruins of Baghdad, so completely had he laid
it waste.
Coming down to more modern times, Saint
Bartholomew's murder is still looked upon
as one of the blackest days in the history of
France.
As a young man I read with revulsion, as
no doubt you did, of the massacres of the
Armenians, in which more than a million
people lost their lives.

SENATE
Not long ago, and indeed still continuing,
are the pogroms in Russia, in which Poles,
Ukrainians and Jews were the sufferers, and
the death roll in those terrible events is
counted in many millions-how many, may
never be known.
But, honourable senators, it was the genocide perpetrated on the Jews in Germany by
the bestial and degraded Nazis, under that
arch-criminal, Hitler, which shocked the
conscience of the world and at last provoked
civilized peoples into some sort of action. Six
million innocent men, women and children
were slaughtered in cold blood for the most
part in gas chambers, by human or inhuman
monsters who boastfully proclaimed themselves a superior race. That colossal crime
cornes home to all of us, for who in this very
chamber but knows some sole survivor of
that nauseating and disgusting carnage. There
are thousands of our fellow citizens in Canada today whose relatives, in entire families,
were lost in the horrors of that sea of blood.
Nor, even now, is the world free of genocidal pogroms. Since Russia overran the three
small Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and
Esthonia, more than a million people have
lost their lives in a reign of terror, and the
killings-to use a more polite term, the
liquidations-are reported to be still continuing. That Russia accepts the denunciation
of genocide as a crime is commendable and
also understandable in view of the state of
world opinion and her efforts to capture the
benefits of a favourable judgment; and the
fact that she refuses to submit to extraRussian investigation charges of genocide
against herself is not surprising.
To Canadians this convention against genocide has a compelling appeal. Canada is a
nation of groups-ethnical, religious, industrial, political and social. No group is in a
majority over all others; all are minorities.
Were any of us to consent to the victimizing
of a group to which we do not belong, we
might in effect be signing our own warrant
of execution. As Shakespeare puts it, in the
mouth of one of his characters:
. . . this even-handed justice
Commends th' ingredients of our poison'd chalice
To our own lips.

In Canada, and I suppose elsewhere, the
safety of each is inextricably linked with the
safety of all. The ratification of this convention by the Houses of Parliament of Canada
is notice to the world that the Canadian
people are shocked and outraged by the genocidal crimes of recent times; that we condemn them, and that in the event of repetition
in the future we will, to the extent of our
ability, seek to exact retribution.

Most fortunately, in my judgment, as will
be illustrated by both our houses adopting
this convention, a world conscience is gradually awakening. Already we have adopted
a number of international conventions, including conventions against the slave trade,
against the production and sale of narcotics,
against piracy, against traffic in women and
children; and now we are about to adopt
this one against the crime of genocide. We
in this chamber have already declared our
belief in the divine or natural law of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, and our
approval of this convention is our supplemental declaration that human rights are not
alone for the strong or the privileged, but are
the heritage of all mankind. Our approval
of this convention is another step towards
the abolition of the law of the jungle, and
the substitution of the rule of law as proclaimed so long ago from the Mountain: "Thou
shalt not kill". It is a recognition of the truth
that "I am my brother's keeper".
Honourable senators, I move the adoption
of this resolution.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why is it that the signature
of Great Britain is missing from the convention?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I also wondered about
that, but I have not been able to discover
the reason. I am perfectly sure, however,
that there is a valid reason. The absence of
this signature does not mean that Great
Britain in any way tolerates genocide, for
history shows that she has always protested
against this sort of thing. I remember Gladstone's denunciation of the "Unspeakable
Turk", and many more such instances could
be enumerated. I may add for the benefit of
the honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) that, although they have not
signed it, neither Canada nor the United
States has yet ratified this convention. The
United States has not ratified it because the
Bar Association of that country is questioning
the phraseology of the convention in an
attempt to improve it. The matter is still
before Congress, as it is before this house.
There is no question that both the United States
and Great Britain will take their places along
with Canada and the thirty-eight other nations
in giving approval to this great convention.
Hon. Mr. Davies: While listening to the very
fine address of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), I wondered whether in wartime the destruction by
atom bomb of a whole city the size of Ottawa
would constitute the crime of genocide?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would not think so.
The destruction of a city may be a matter of

MAY 27, 1952
war; genocide is an attack upon a group. One
of the neatest illustrations of genocide would
be the massacre of Glencoe, where one tribe
set out to destroy another. The destruction
that took place in the war thirough which we
have just passed, when whole -cities were
laid waste, was flot the resuit of attacks
made with the intention of destroying groups
of people; it resulteci from attacks on mllitary
targets ini these cities.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable sienators, I
just want to say that I approve of the
resolution.
The motion was agreed to.
EXTRADITION
MOTION FOR APPROVAL 0F SUPPLEMENTARY
CONVENTION WITH UNITED STATES

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament
do approve the Supplemnentary Extradition Convention between the United States of America and
Canada, signed at Ottawa on October 26, 1951,
amending the Supplementary Extradition Convention between the United States of America and Her
Britannic Majesty, signed at Washington on December 13, 1900, and that this house do approve the
same.

He said: Honourable senators, this resolution deals with the matter of extradition and,
indeed, the treaty to which it relates bears
the titie: "Supplementary Convention to the
Supplementary Convention between Her
Majesty and the United States of America
for the Mutuai Extradition of Fugitive
Criminals, signed at Washington, December
13, 1900".
Perh-aps, for the benefit of non-legal membcrs in this chamber, I should give a brie!
explanation of extradition. It is defined in
Halsbury's Laws of England in these terms:

Great Britain.
Thus the first extradition
treaty which affected this country, and by
which this country was bound, was a treaty
between Great Britain and the United States,
concluded in Washington on the 9th of August
1842. That was known as the WebsterAshburton Treaty. Its principal object had
nothing whatever to do with extradition; it
was the treaty which, as we learned in our
history books, settled the boundaries of the
State of Oregon. But it did also deal incidentally with the question of extradition; and
Article X of the treaty set out the offences
for which extradition can be mutually sought,
as foliows:
It is agreed that the UJnited States and Her
Britannic Majesty shall. upon mutual requisitions
by themn or their ministers. officers, or authorities,
respectively made, deliver up to justice ail persons
who being charged with the crime of murder, or
assault with Intent to commit murder, or piracy, or
arson. or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of
iorged paper, committed within the jurisdîction of
either, shail seek an asylum, or shall be found,

That was the list of extraditable crimes
settled in 1842.
Another portion o! this treaty is worthy
o! note, for it introduces a very important
principle. It says this:

evidence of crlminality as, according to the laws of

shall be found, would justify his apprehension and
commitment for trial, if the crime or ofience had
there been committed.

What that means is that the crime for
which extradition is sought must be a crime
in both countries; both in the country where
the man bas taken refuge and i the country
which is seeking bis extradition. That is

Article II stated:
The operation of the present convention is confined to the cases in which the offences mentioned
in the preceding article having been committed in
the United States or in the Dominion of Canada,
the person charged with the offence is found in
the Dominion of Canada or in the United States
respectively.

Now we corne to the year 1925. Canada
had then attained her full national status,
and on January 8 of that year a further
supplementary convention was entered into
between the United States and His Majesty,
acting for the first time solely on behalf of
Canada. That convention again expanded

by the late Honourable Ernest Lapointe,
he being at that time the Minister of Justice
for Canada, and by the Honourable Charles
Evans Hughes, at that time Secretary of
State of the United States of America, and
later, as honourable senators know, Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States.
Today the bouse is being asked to approve
still another supplementary convention, this
too having been negotiated directly between
Canada and the United States, and having
been signed in Ottawa on October 26, 1951.
It was signed on behalf of Canada by the
Minister for External Affairs and the Minister of Justice, and on behalf of the United
States of America by the United States
minister in Ottawa. I hope the house will
bear with me if I endeavour to make a short
explanation of, firstly, what this new extradition convention or treaty purports to do;
and, secondly, of the reasons why it is considered necessary at the present time.
First of all, what does it do? I referred a
moment ago to the supplementary convention of December 13, 1900. That convention
added to the list of extraditable crimes a
further one, No. 11, which was this:
Obtaining money, valuable
property by false pretences.

securities or other

The supplementary treaty now before us
proposes to strike out Clause 11 and to substitute in its place two new clauses, 11A and
11B, which read:
11A. Obtaining property, money or valuable securities by false pretences or by defrauding the public
or any person by deceit or falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether such deceit or falsehood or
any fraudulent means would or would not amount
to a false pretence;
11B. Making use of the mails in connection with
schemes devised or intended to doceive or defraud
the public or for the purpose of obtaining money
under false pretences.

Those are the proposed two new substitute
clauses.

Now, secondly, what are the reasons why
these amendments are brought forward at
the present time? The principal reason is
this. For some years there have been bitter
complaints by residents of the United States
that they have been victimized by a small
unscrupulous group of Canadian brokers and
"share-pushers", operating principally from
Toronto, who have sold them worthless
securities of shady Canadian corporations,
mostly mining and oil ventures, whereby
these citizens of a friendly neighbouring
country have lost money estimated to run
into many millions of dollars. I think it
is only too true to say that the victims of
these "share-pushers" have been the small
people, the innocent people, who know very
little about financial affairs or investments,
and who, in general could least afford the
losses which they have sustained.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Will it work both ways?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, it could work both
ways.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Was not much of that
selling done by telephone?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, a great deal.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I should like to ask my
honourable friend if those people could not
be prosecuted and, on proper evidence, convicted in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If the crime was committed in Canada, I suppose they could be.
Hon. Mr. Farris: They are in Canada when
the offence is committed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That may be so.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Then why should that
not be the remedy?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, offences are committed both in Canada and in the United
States, and the desire is to have such persons
prosecuted in both countries. Damage is
caused in the United States, even when the
offence is committed in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Where a man has committed an offence in Canada, why could not
the United States authorities lay charges here
and prosecute him here?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That would involve the
coming to Canada of the unfortunate victims
to give evidence.
These complaints by individuals have been
strongly supported by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission. As
honourable senators know, the Securities and
Exchange Commission is a federal body which
regulates offerings of securities to the public
in the United States. It was set up under
the United States Securities Act of 1933, with
stringent safeguards to the public of that

MAY 27, 1952
country. It is largely a result of the tightening up of the securities sale provisions in the
United States in 1933, that these undesirable
practices of touting stocks from Canada
grew up.
This convention was submitted for consideration to a joint sub-committee of the
Committee on Foreign Relations and the
Committee on Banking and Currency in the
United States Senate. A hearing was held
on March 3, 1952, and the principal witness
appearing before the joint sub-committee was
the Honourable Richard B. McEntire, Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. I should like now to read a
few extracts from Mr. McEntire's evidence,
and thus give the bouse some idea of what
bas been complained of. I quote:
This convention, as the committee no doubt bas
in mind, enlarges the present treaty coverage of
extraditable crimes between Canada and the United
States by enlarging the definition of "fraud," particularly relating to fraud in securities transactions
and by adding the crime of mail fraud. These are
the outgrowth of negotiations over a considerable
period between the two countries, and, while I
know the committee is very busy and I will try
to give it in capsule form, perhaps just a word of
the background of this problem Is in order.
Immediately following the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 a good many of the so-called fraud
artists from this country went to Canada and
started their operations there. Likewise, they were
joined by quite a number of Canadian nationals
who set up operations, originally- in various places,
but for the past 15 years almost exclusively in the
city of Toronto. They mailed great quantities of
literature into the United States in an attempt to
sell securities on every sort of venture that you
could imagine, and adopted a follow-up technique
on telephones, placing calls literally ail over the
United States.
These promotions almost invariably were in ventures that are associated in the public mind with
rapid and spectacular wealth, principally gold,
silver, oil properties, and, in recent years uranium.
They took every advantage of the fact that highly
publicized gold and oil discoveries have been made
in the Dominion of Canada in recent years. The
sponsored property-the property that they would
claim to be sponsoring-was always one that was
just adjacent to one of these successful developments, notwithstanding the fact that in one situation we investigated we found that "adjacent"
meant 1,700 miles away. They would always try to
say, on gold mines, that they were in the same
vein, in addition to being adjacent, to spectacular
developments.
The whole problem has been one of sale of securities entirely by. fraudulent means. Of the class
that I am speaking of now, I want to make it clear
that for the most part virtually none of the proceeds bas ever gone into any attempt to dig a mine
or to drill oil wells. The bulk of the proceeds were

siphoned off in selling commissions and in business
expense. The whole thing may be characterized

as what we at the Securities and Exchange Commission have found to be the most vicious securities

old clause 11 of the Extradition Treaty of
1900, which we are replacing, "false pretences"
is made an extraditable offence. Section 404
of the Criminal Code defines "false pretences"
as follows:
A false pretence is a representation, either by
words or otherwise, of a matter of fact either
present or past, which representation is known to
the person making it to be false, and which is made
with a fraudulent intent to induce the person te
whom it is made to act upon such representation.

I call the attention of the bouse to the
use of the words "representation. . .of a matter of fact either present or past"; and
"which representation is known to the person
making it to be false. . ."
Hon. Mr. Euler: How can it be a fact?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: A great number of the
complaints of sale of securities have dealt
not with either past or present facts, but
with future prospects-the rosy hope, held
out to prospective investors, of what is going
to happen in the future. Moreover, it bas
been extremely difficult in many cases to
prove that the persons who made certain
statements knew that they were false. It is
conceivable, had things gone extremely well,
that what they said might have turned out
to be true.
The convention proposes to replace clause
11 with clause 11A, which constitutes as a
crime:
Obtaining property, money or valuable securities

by false pretences or
any person by deceit
ulent means, whether

or falsehood or other fraudsuch deceit or falsehood or

That provision corresponds very closely to
section 444 of the Criminal Code, which reads:

liable to five years' imprisonment who by deceit or
falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud
the public or any person, ascertained or unascertained,-

Here I omit a few inapplicable words.
whether such deceit or falsehood or other fraudulent means would or would not amount to a false
pretence as hereinbefore defined.

So the new clause, 11A of the convention
corresponds pretty well as to language with
section 444 of the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is a very recent
enactment, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: A couple of years ago.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable senator give a further explanation of the last
fraud extant.

on:

But it goes

. . . whether such deceit or falsehood or any
fraudulent means would or would not amount to a
false pretence.

I cannot understand that.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is what I was
trying to explain. I quoted to the house the
definition of "false pretences" in the Criminal
Code. A false pretence has to be a false
pretence about something past or present.
This goes further. Under this language a man
may be convicted if he makes a false statement about something future, rather than
something past or present. The definition is
so worded as to make it broader than the
definition of false pretences contained in the
Criminal Code.
Section 11B of the proposed convention
adds as a crime:
"Making use of the mails in connection with
schemes devised or intended to deceive or defraud
the public or for the purpose of obtaining money
under false pretences."

In its wording this corresponds substantially
with section 209 of our Criminal Code, which
makes it an offence to do that very thing if
the offence is committed in Canada.
As I have said already, and as appears from
the quotation from the evidence of the head
of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
at times there has been a flood of circulars
and prospectuses sent from headquarters in
Canada to investors and other people in the
United States. I am sure that my honourable
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) will ask "Does a person who mails a
fraudulent prospectus from an address in
Canada to an address in the United States
thereby "make use of the mails" in the
United States in such a way as to bring him
within the purview of this convention? I am
advised that that question has been considered
in Great Britain and that the courts there
have answered it in the affirmative. There
was a case which involved the Extradiction
Treaty between Great Britain and Norway:
a resident of England sent a fraudulent prospectus to a resident of Norway, and the
British courts held that he could be extradited
to Norway because he had sent this circular
from England to Norway. I suppose the
theory is that if a person puts a letter in the
mails in Canada, addressed to someone in
the United States, he knows very well that
he will make use of the mails of the United
States to enable it to reach its destination.
I have tried to show the house that the
two new provisions of this convention, namely
11A and 11B, correspond very closely to two
provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code,
sections 444 and 209 respectively. I have done
so to show the house that in this extradition

treaty we are still following the principle of
mutuality to which I referred a few minutes
ago. That is to say, we are not making it
possible to extradite a Canadian citizen to
the United States for the doing of something
in the United States which would not be a
crime if it were done in Canada.
I might mention incidentally that previously, in 1945, there were negotiations during which the United States authorities
proposed to this country a treaty which did
infringe the principle of mutuality. They
wanted to make persons extraditable from
Canada in respect of violations of a number
of provisions of the Securities Act of the
United States which had no counterpart in
this country. The matter did not come before
this house, but it was considered very seriously by a committee of the other chamber,
and because it violated the principle of
mutuality the proposed treaty of 1945 was
rejected.
The convention now before us bas already
been approved by both houses of the United
States Congress.
May I refer for a moment to the position
of the provinces? It is true that their consent
to this treaty is not required, but because
the Criminal Code is administered by the
provincial attorneys-general in their respective provinces, it is wise that they should be
consulted about a matter of this kind. In fact
all of them were consulted when this convention was in process of negotiation. The
province principally concerned was Ontario,
and not only did it approve this convention,
but the deputy attorney-general of Ontario
took a very active part in the negotiations and,
I understand, in the drafting of the convention itself. Drafts of the convention were
submitted to the attorneys-general of all the
other provinces, and all but one replied,
either with approval or without having any
comments to make. The single exception is
Manitoba, from which no reply was received,
and in this case perhaps we can say that
silence implies consent. The draft was also
submitted to the principal stock exchanges
and to various investment dealers' associations, none of whom raised .any objection
whatever. Perhaps I should add that this
convention was unanimously approved by
the other chamber on Wednesday last.
Certain advantages will accrue from ratification. First, I think we all agree that we
should do what we can to prevent citizens of
the United States from being defrauded by
operations of this kind conducted from Canada. And of course, as the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) said, the
converse is equally true; this convention will
prevent, at least in some degree, fraud upon

MAY 27, 1952
Canadian citizens through similar operations
by citizens of the United States. Indeed I am
informed that when, last autunn, it became
known that a treaty of this kind was being
negotiated, the activities of these gentry
were voluntarily, and of their own motion,
curtailed.
In the second place, the convention will
benefit legitimate business in this country,
particularly the sale of shares and securities
of reputable Canadian corporations.
There is no doubt that, as a result of the
carrying on of the operations in question in
parts of the United States quite a feeling has
developed in recent years that Canada has not
been behaving well towards the citizens of a
friendly country. It is important for us to
realize that for many years to come the
United States will probably continue to be
an important source of finances for the development of our country.
There is yet a third benefit which is likely
to result from the adoption of this convention.
As I have said, the Securities and Exchange
Commissio of the United States is the body
which is charged with the oversight and
approval of all issues of securities in that
country, whether issued by United States corporations or by foreign corporations. Honourable senators of the legal profession have no
doubt had the same difficulty that I have had
in attempting to draft prospectuses for the
Securities and Exchange Commission. They
know how strict the requirements have been.
In the United States the Securities and Exchange Commission have greatly modified
their strict requirements as regards small
issues of securities, totalling not over $300,000
by United States corporations. So far they
have refused to do this for Canada, because
they claim they have not had sufficient control
over people in Canada of the kind I have
mentioned. We are advised, however, that
if this convention is ratified there is every
likelihood that the Securities and Exchange
Commission will extend this modification to
Canadian issues of sinall amounts. This wil
be valuable to people who are attempting to
raise moderate amounts of capital in the
United States for development in this country.
Honourable senators, for the reasons I have
mentioned this afternoon, I have no hesitation
in recommending this convention to the
Senate, and in urging the adoption of the
resolution which I have moved. If honourable
senators feel that the subject matter of this
resolution should be referred to committee,
as was done in the other place, I would have
no objection whatsoever to it being referred
to our Committee on External Relations. This

would enable honourable senators to get further information from the officials of the
Department of Justice.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I am a little concerned about this matter.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
has said that we should bear in mind that the
primary objective is to prevent citizens of
the United States from being defrauded by
people in Canada. I have not got before me
the definition of the jurisdiction in Canada,
but it is my recollection that you may prosecute a person in any place where any part of
the offence has been committed. For instance,
if I were in Vancouver and called up my honourable friend in Montreal and made false
pretences as a result of which I obtained
money from him, I could be prosecuted in
either Vancouver or Montreal. In other words,
the territory in which the offence was committed would include both places. My understanding is that if I am in Toronto and,
in communicating by telephone, letter, or
otherwise, with some person in New York city
I commit an offence, it constitutes an offence
both in Canada and in the United States; and
I can be prosecuted for that offence either in
Canada or in the United States, depending
on where I am apprehended. If this is so,
why could not the remedy of prosecuting persons in Toronto, or some other evil placeSorne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Vancouver, for instance.
Hon. Mr. Farris: -be
carried out?
Incidentally, Toronto seems to be the centre
of iniquity in this case. I asked my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) why this
could not be done, and he said that it would
mean that the unfortunate victims would
have to come to Canada to prosecute their
cases. The fact is that these prosecutions
will be carried out in the United States by
the Securities Exchange Commission or some
other authority, and not by the poor unfortunate victims. It must be remembered, too,
that these people will have to appear before
a magistrate here prior to extradition proceedings being taken. This will probably
cost them just as much as a trial, but it is
far from being a trial. Further, there are
magistrates and magistrates.
I am quite in sympathy with the purpose
of this legislation, which is to get after these
men who come over from the United States
and have them retuined to their country.
But it does not stop there. While my honourable friend was speaking I wrote down a
note to this effect: What we may well be concerned with is not the evil to be remedied but
the evils which may result from the attempted
remedy. It would be all well and good if

SENATE
we were sure this measure would be confined to the returning to the United States of
wayward American citizens who come over
here to operate. The fact is that the American authorities can lay a charge against a
person born and brought up in Canada, who
may innocently make certain representations
in the United States. Then they can come
over here and make out a prima facie case
against him, and on the strength of this they
can yank him out of his country for the first
time and prosecute him. He may even be
convicted by a jury in a territory which has
some prejudice in the matter.
I understand the law at present to be that
these men on the Securities Commission in
the United States, who are so much concerned about this matter and who apparently
are willing to put up the money to come
over here and raise a prima facie case,
can in fact have a man arrested in Canadaa man who probably never was out of this
country in his life-and bring all their evidence over here and have him tried before
a Canadian jury. If I am right, I do not
see why that remedy should not be considered adequate.
In the circumstances
alleged here today, I do not see why we
should imperil our own citizens by subjecting
them to the possibility of being extradited
on a prima facie case and tried in a foreign
country. It seems to me that the whole
matter should be very carefully investigated
before we approve this convention. As I
understand it, we could have the convention
referred to a committee before passing the
motion for approval.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am not at all sure that
the External Relations Committee is the
proper one to consider a matter of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it is not.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That committee is concerned primarily with matters having to do
with Canada and other countries on an
international basis. What we are concerned
about here is the safety and protection of
our own citizens, and I should think the
Committee on Banking and Commerce is
the appropriate committee for a study of
the subject-matter of this convention. Unless
there is some reason against it, I will move
that the convention be referred to that committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
what is worrying me about this proposal is
that it goes farther than our Criminal Code.
If the convention provided for extradition
for false pretences, I would have no objection,
for that is a crime covered by our Code. But

I do not see why the convention should go
farther than we go when we are dealing
with our own citizens. Notwithstanding the
reference to section 406 of the Code, and
also to section 404,Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Section 444.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 404 is the definition of false pretences.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Will my honourable
friend allow me? Section 11A of the proposed
convention follows very closely the wording
of section 444 of the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why is the convention
not confined to offences provided for in
our own Code? I gather from the remarks
of the sponsor of the motion (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that it sets up a new definition of an
offence. Why does it do that?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: We must remember
that it is a treaty between one country and
another, and on the principle of mutuality
you must deal with the same sort of crime
in one country as in the other. But you
cannot describe the crime in exactly the
words that are used in either country; you
have to try to define it in terms common to
both countries. We cannot take the exact
wording of section 444 and place it into
the extradition treaty, for we are trying to
make the provision correspond as closely as
possible to similar provisions in the United

States Code.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I should like to ask a
question of the senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), for he possibly knows
more about this matter than all the rest of
us do.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I may refuse to answer
on the advice of counsel.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Ordinarily and primarily
extradition is the bringing of an offender
back to the country where he committed his
offence. This convention has expanded that
idea so as to make it possible to extradite
him to a country where a part of his offence
was committed, notwithstanding the fact that

he could have been just as well prosecuted
in the country from which his extradition is
sought. I would ask my honourable friend if
he knows of any reason why prosecutions
for these offences that we have been referring
to should not take place in Canada or the
United States; that is, wherever the person
was at the time he committed the offences.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I know of no reason
for that, except the one that has already been
given, that it is more convenient to prosecute
him where the prosecutor lives-I mean,
more convenient to the prosecutor

MAY 27, 1952
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is not more convenient
to the accused.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It certainly is not. And
while one hesitates to stand in the way of
efforts to strengthen the good feeling between
ourselves and the United States, one would
feel rather troubled by his conscience if he
voted for a law of this kind without giving
it much more thorough study than we have
given it so far. I fully approve of the suggestion of the senator from Vancouver-South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) that this matter be referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
rather than to the Committee on External
Relations. The Department of External
Affairs has already had a crack at the matter; now let someone else take it under consideration. I should like to see the matter go
before the Banking and Commerce Committee, where we could have in attendance officers of the Department of Justice, to tell us
how much farther this convention goes than
we have travelled in the Criminal Code. We
are now studying and working on improvements to the Code, and I am perfectly sure
that if it were proposed to include in the
Code such provisions as are in this convention, we would not adopt them without very
careful consideration.
Due notice should be given when the matter is to come up before the committee. I
admit that I have known of these proposals
for a long time-they have been before us in
parliamentary circles for several years now
-but I confess that I have not studied as
carefully as is necessary the actual phraseology that has been put before us this afternoon. And it is careful study of the very
words that is required: at this time.
I second the motion for reference of the
subject-matter to the Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I wish to say just a few words. I am
not a lawyer, but after some recent experience
I feel that if this convention could prevent
gangs of racketeers from operating between
.the United States and Canada, it would do
much to protect our poor people. In our
province we have had some unfortunate
experiences with the operations of international racketeers. They have come over
here and taken most unfair advantage of a
considerable number of people, many of them
poor people who are entirely without
About
experience in financial matters.
$400,000 of the savings of farmers and others
was lost through the activities of one company. A legal battle over the matter was
fought for months and months, with good
lawyers on both sides, and after lengthy discussions there was so much confusion that it

was difficult to say who in fact was the thief.
I do not know if the convention before us
contains the most suitable legal phraseology,
but I hope we can have a provision in the law
that will protect people in the United
States and Canada, especially poor people,
from racketeers of the kind I have been
referring to.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We all agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: If this convention
would give that protection, I am in favour
of it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
before putting the motion for reference of
the subject-matter to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, I wish to call
attention to the fact that if this motion is
passed the order will disappear from the
Order Paper, unless there is an adjournment
of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
may I say just a word in reply to what was
said by the senator from Vancouver-South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) and the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) on the
point of which committee is the proper one
for a study of this matter. It was without any
arrière-pensée that I suggested reference to
the Committee on External Relations. I mentioned that committee simply because the
other house had referred this matter to its
Committee on External Affairs, and there was
a reference of it by the Senate of the United
States to its Committee on Foreign Relations.
I have no objection to it being referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee; indeed,
perhaps there is something to be said for the
suggestion that it should be so referred.
In view of what His Honour the Speaker
has said, I would ask the Whip to adjourn the
debate, and the matter can proceed from

CONSUMER CREDIT
(TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT
MOTION

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Farris:
That the following address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, Member of the Order of the Companions
of Honour, Governor General and Commanderin-Chief of Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subParliament
Senate of Canada, in
jects, the
assembled, respectfully approach Your Excellency
Credit (Temporary
praying that the Consumer
Provisions) Act be continued in force until the
thirty-first day of July, one thousand nine hundred
and fifty-four.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators
will recall that yesterday at the conclusion
of the debate on the motion to extend the
Consumer Credit (Temporary Provisions) Act,
I informed the house that I had been advised
that an amendment had been offered in the
House of Commons and had been accepted
by the Minister. At my request the Whip
adjourned the debate to allow me to get
certain information to place before the
bouse today. Honourable senators will note
that the resolution contemplates the continuing in force of the Act until July 31,
1954. I am informed that by the amendment passed in the other house the period
of extension was reduced, so that it would
expire in 1953 instead of in 1954. The Minister of Finance on behalf of the government agreed to the amendment, and the
resolution as passed in the other place extends the provisions of the Act for one year
instead of two years.
As I an sure that honourable senators
would approve of the shortening of the
period of extension, I now move, with leave
of the Senate, seconded by the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
that in the last line of the motion the words
"one thousand nine hundred and fifty-four"
be deleted, and that the words "one thousand
nine hundred and fifty-three" be
substituted therefor.
Some Hon. Senators: Carried!
The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was amended.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The resolution, as
amended, now stands adjourned by the Whip,
unless some honourable senator desires to
debate the matter further at this time.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted to say a few
words on this resolution?

MAY 27, 1952
As everyone knows, the subject of credit
restrictions has two sides. By way of illustration, I should like to draw the attention of
the house to some statistics prepared by
Caisse Populaire Desjardins, showing the
experience of this banking organization in
Quebec. The figures for the year 1950 show
deposits of $465 million, withdrawals of $453
million, and a balance of $11 million. The
figures further show that the average balance
per member was $19.45, and the balance of
savings for each dollar deposited was 2.5
cents. It is to be noted that during that
year the credit restrictions were not in effect.
I now turn to the figures for the year 1951,
when the Consumer Credit (Temporary Provisions) Act was in force. In that year the
bank had deposits of $583 million and withdrawals of $557 million, but the balance of
savings per member was $39.86, and for each
dollar deposited it was 4-4 cents. If we
break down the figures by cities, semi-urban
areas and rural areas, the result is as follows:
1950
cents
Balance of savings per dollar deposited:
4-4
Cities ...............................
1.8
Semi-urban areas ...................
1.0
Rural areas .........................

1951
cents
4-9
2-9
4.3

That, honourable senators, indicates to me
the effect of the imposition of credit
restrictions. Laws are not framed for the
protection of a few or a limited class, but,
ordinarily, in the interests of the mass of the
people in the ordinary operations of their
lives. In our Caisses Popularies we have no
millionaires: most of our clients are labouring men, farmers and the like. With these
figures and this explanation you will have a
right picture of the institution.
The motion was agreed to.
EMERGENCY POWERS ACT
MOTION

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved:
That the folowing address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To Ris Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, Governor General and
Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subParliament
of Canada, in
jects, the Senate
assembled, respectfully approach Your Excellency
praying that sections one to three of the Emergency
Powers Act be continued in force, up to and including the thirtieth day of May, one thousand
nine hundred and fifty-three.

He said: Honourable senators, this resolution
seeks to have parliament consider whether or

not the special responsibility placed upon the
government to deal with emergencies which
might arise out of the grave tension besetting
the world today should be continued beyond
the initial period provided for the Emergency Powers Act of 1951, passed in the first
session of that year.
Honourable senators may recall the terms
employed in the preamble of the Emergency
Powers Act, which is chapter 5 of the
Statutes of 1951:
Whereas an international emergency exists that
threatens the security of Canada;
And whereas it is essential that emergency
powers be conferred to enable measures to be taken
as urgently required from time to time to carry
out adequate defence preparations, to regulate the
economy of Canada to meet the needs of defence
and to stabilize the economy and to safeguard it
from disruption that may result from defence
preparations in Canada or from emergency measures
taken in other countries, in order that defence
preparations may not be Impeded;
And whereas it is preferable that the necessary
emergency powers be exercised under special authority from Parliament rather than that the War
Measures Act be brought into force so long as
present efforts to avert war are continuing and,
moreover, it is not desirable that the wide powers
conferred by that Act to interfere with the fundamental liberties of the individual should now be
brought into operation:
Therefore His Majesty . . . (etc., etc.)

Subsections 1 and 2 of section 2 of the
Act described the powers which the government would be called upon to exercise if and
when necessary. May I be permitted to
refresh the memories of honourable senators
by quoting the provisions of subsection one
of section two:
2. (1) The Governor in Council may do and
authorize such acts and things, and make from
time to time such orders and regulations, as he may
by reason of the existing international emergency
deem necessary or advisable for the security,
defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and
for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the
generality of the foregoing termas, it is hereby
declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within the
classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is
to say:
(a) control and suppression of maps, plans and
photographs;
(b) control af communications and means of
communication;
(c) control of the harbours, ports and territorial
waters of Canada and the movements of vessels;
(d) transportation by land, air or water and the
control of the transport of persons and things;
(e) trading, exportation, importation, production
and manufacture; and
(f) imposition and recovery, in connection with
any scheme of control, of fees or charges payable
to the Receiver General of Canada or into any fund
or account established by order or regulation for
the purposes of the scheme of control.

These powers were qualified by subsection
(2) of section 2 in the following way:
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained therein,
the powers conferred on the governor in council by

SENATE
subsection one do not include power to make orders
or regulations in relation to
(a) arrest, except as incidental to proceedings
under section three, detention, exclusion or deportation of any person;
(b) censorship or the control and suppression of
publications and writings; or
(c) expenditure of moneys otherwise than in
accordance with an appropriation by parliament
except expenditure of moneys from any fund or
account established by order or regulation in connection with a schene of control for the purposes
of that scheme of control.

Honourable senators may further recal that
subsection (4) of the same section provided
that any order or regulation made under the
Act would be tabled within five days from
the date thereof, if parliament were in session,
or within five days from the opening of parliament, were it not in session at the time; and
that subsection (5) provided that any ordet
might be annulled by resolution of the Senate
and the House of Commons within forty days
from the aforementioned tabling. The government undertook, it will be recalled, to
provide an opportunity for dealing expeditiously with any such motion that might be
proposed.
Section four of the Act provided that it
would expire on the 31st of May, 1952, but
might be extended for a further period of
not more than twelve months on resolution of
the two houses of parliament. Such resolution
is presently before this house, honourable
senators, providing us with an opportunity
of determining whether or not certain powers
under the Act should be so extended.
Let us now briefly note the occasions upon
which recourse has been had to the provisions
of the act-an act, let it be kept in mind,
designed not to usurp the legitimate powers
of parliament, but rather to increase the
responsibility of the government, subject to
the control of parliament, and to permit the
government's taking prompt action in the face
of any emergency threatening the peace,
order and good government of the country as
a result of the threatening international situation.
Nineteen orders have been made under the
Emergency Powers Act. Five of these, P.C.
1439 of March 22, 1951, P.C. 2101 of April
26, 1951, P.C. 2847 of June 4, 1951, P.C. 3855
of July 24, 1951 and P.C. 2306 of May 2, 1952,
have to do wtih the Great Lakes seamen's
security regulations.
Three orders concern the establishment of
priorities control and the appointment of controllers. They are orders P.C. 2399 of May 16,
1951, P.C. 2621 of May 24, 1951 and P.C. 5645

of October 22, 1951. The first had to do with
controls, and the other two had to do with
the appointment of officials to exercise the
powers directed to be exercised by the regulations.
Two orders, P.C. 4535 and P.C. 4558 of
August 29, 1951, concerned transport control
and the appointment of a Transport Controller. These had in view facilitating the
distribution of freight cars throughout the
Prairie Provinces in order to move grain
destined for export.
P.C. 1234 of March 3, 1952, concerned the
control of the export and import of cattle
and meat products to and from the United
States, consequent upon the embargo resulting
from United States laws after the outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease in Canada. This particular order might equally well
have been made under the Export and Import
Permits Act, but it was felt that reference to
the Emergency Powers Act would place the
validity of the order beyond challenge.
A security order, P.C. 3486 of July 4, 1951,
was exempted from publication, the only
order to fall into this category. Another order,
P.C. 3484, of August 8, 1951, had to do with
the operation by agencies of the United States
Government and the United States defence
forces, of radio stations in Canada, in connection with our joint arrangements for protection of this continent. Another order, P.C.
6598 of December 6, 1951, exempted from
customs duties personal gifts, of a value not
exceeding $25, from members of the Canadian forces serving abroad and addressed to
relatives or friends in Canada.
Five other orders were passed under the
Emergency Powers Act to give immediate
effect to provisions that it was intended to
have enacted in a permanent form by legislation as soon as possible. They are P.C. 2932
of June 7, 1951, extending the provisions of
the Defence Services Pension Act to members
of the regular forces granted temporary commissions, and P.C. 3417 of July 4, 1951, concerning the disposition of offences committed
prior to the coming into force of the code of
service discipline. Both these orders have
been replaced by legislation. An order made
on July 31, 1951, concerning the Agricultural
Products Board has since also been established in legislation. The order made on
April 4, 1951, P.C. 1608, providing that other
metals be substituted for nickel in the Canadian five-cent piece, is being covered by
legislation to be introduced at this session.
On September 26, 1951, P.C. 5122 was
made operative postponing the weigh-over

MAY 27, 1952
of grain required by the Canada Grain Act.
That was intended to be covered .by legislation, and there is a section to that effect in
the Canada Grain Act amendment now before
another place.
No one of .these nineteen orders made
under the authority of the Emergency
Powers Act of 1951 has been challenged as
iniproper i any way by any member -of
parliament. This, I feel, would indicate not
only our good fortune in not having to
deal with any more serious emergencies
than those to which the orders refer, but the
care which the government exercised under
the Act in doing only those things urgently
requ.ired for the peace, order and good
As to real
government of the country.
emergencies since the statute came into
force, we have been truly fortunate, but
he would be an optimist indeed who would
say that the international situation implied
in the preamble to this statute, and which
I have recited, has in any degree become
less tense than when that statute was adopted.
Many, indeed, would incline to an opposite
view. We are forced today to appropriate
billions o! dollars to keep us in a state o!
preparedness against the possibillty of an
eventuality which we fervently hope will
neyer arise. It is f elt that while building
up our armed forces along with our allies,
with a view to forestalling any great international crisis, we should at the same time
have ready for use, if required, some extraordinary powers, however much we may
hope that they may neyer have to be used.
In. the present difficult times we are convinced that we would be taking an undesirable, if not unforgiveable, risk in not having
an instrument capable of being used expeditiously if conditions so warrant. This, of
course, is a matter for parliament to decide.
Fourteen months have now gone by since
the Act was passed. In that time I arn sure
that any uneasiness that any honourable
senator may have f elt as ta the possibility of
abuse of any power vested in the government, will have been completely dissipated.
The same undertakings given when the Act
was originally enacted are given now, with
respect ta bringing to a decision any resalution or vote designed to set aside any regulatien that might be made under it. The
possession of extraordinary powers is distasteful to any democratic government, but
critical and extraordinary times force distasteful eigencies upon us. The guards
against abuse are ample, however, and the

record is one to inspire confidence. I there-ý
fore recommend for the seriaus consideration
of honourable senators the question of
whether or not these powers should remain
avallable for another period of twelve months,
and I urgently suggest they should.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, 1
have neyer been in favour of these powers,
though there mnay be some excuse for them
in time of war. Whlle it is true that we are
now experiencing a .cold war, the Parliament
of Canada can easily be summoned at any
time to give sanction to legisiation of this
kind.
I have always been uneasy about a goverament legislating by order in councîl, and
that is what this amounts to. I do not like
it; and while I do not intend to argue the
pros and cons of the matter, I may say to
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) that there is a growing feeling of
uneasiness in democratic countries which
follow the British parilamentary system, that
too much power is falling into the hands o!
the cabinet. Canada is just as bad in this
respect as any other country. Because of the
small mai ority enjoyed by the Conservatives
in the House o! Commons, the British
cabinet does not have rnuch power in this
respect at the present time, but evidence of
this growing practice is to be found in South
Africa, where the government is exercising
practically dictatorial powers. In that country the parliament and flot the judges are
interpreting and enforcing the laws o! the
country because of a judicial decision that
was contrary to what the mai ority thought it
should be.
1 arn opposed to this kcind of legislation,
and do not thinik it is necessary, but I arn not
going to cause delay in this matter.
Hon. Gardon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, before we adjourn, and while the
thoughts expressed by the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) are fresh ini
our minds, I wonder if he would be good
enough te explain why the previous resolution dealing with the Consumer Credit (Ternporary Provisions) Act was not incorporated
with this resolution, and the two matters
deait with in the one resolution?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think the answer
is that the Consumer Credit Act, which is for
the control of credit, is a separate statute
dealing with a specffic thing, the control of
credit. A more or less blanket authority is

326

given under the Emergency Powers Act.
Under the section that I referred to, orders
in council may be passed, some of them of a
temporary nature, in the expectation that at
the first opportunity they, like the temporary
credit restrictions, will be embodied in a
statute. Several orders in council passed
under authority of the Act have now ceased

to exist because the subject-matter with
which they deait has been covered in the
statutes.
The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was adopted.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Saller A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 207, an Act to amend the
Excise Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
amends the Excise Act, whereas the bill
which has just received second reading
amends the Excise Tax Act. The difference
between the two Acts, in principle, as I
understand it, is thaît the Excise Tax Act deals
with ad valorem rates and also specific rates
of duty on a wide variety of goods-goods
which are at large, in the sense that the
manufacturer is in possession of them and
free to deal with themi, subject to being
accountable for the tax when he sells them.
The Excise Act applies to goods in bond
under some restriction or other. Sometimes

the assurance of payment of the excise on
such goods is guaranteed by a bond given to
the department when it permits the goods to
be moved into the premises of -a. manufacturer for processing by him. In theory these
goods are still in bond even while on the
manufacturer's
premises.
I understand
that to be the essential difference between
the two statutes. Frankly, so far as I am
concerned, I think I could adapt my mind to
an understanding of the levies if they were
all made in the one statute, but we have to
deal with the separate statutes as we find
them.
The changes proposed by this bill are very
simple. Section 1 has to do with spirits.
Methods have been developed by which
spirits can be manufactured and produced
other than by the process of distillation. I
understand that alcohol is manufactured now
out of petroleum, for instance. It is necessary to amend the definition of "spirits" to
keep it in line with scientific developments,
and that is the only reason for this amendment.
Subsection 2 of the same section defines
"Canadian brandy". There is nothing new
in this. The definition has for years been
in the schedule to the Act, and all that is
being done now is to put it in the definition
section, where it properly belongs.
Section 2 of the bill amends the definition
of "Canada twist". If you look at the
explanatory note on the opposite page of
the bill, you will see that the new definition
eliminates the words "by the cultivator
thereof". Those words have become meaningless, because no person can manufacture
Canada twist for sale unless he is licensed
as a tobacco manufacturer.
Subsection 3, on page 2 of the bill, provides
that every licence shall terminate on the
31st day of March in each year. Under the
present law, anyone who applied for a
licence at the beginning of the fiscal year
or within a certain period thereof paid the
full year's fee, but if application was made
for it after the first day of October the
licence was issued for the remainder of the
fiscal year upon payment of half of the
annual fee. It has been decided to do away
with this division of the year, and if this
amendment is adopted it will not matter
when a licence is applied for-whether in the
first month or the twelfth-the full year's
fee will be payable for the licence. In other
words, there will no longer be any bargain
prices for licences issued under this section.
Section 4 has to do with drawbacks on
spirits when used for certain purposes At
the present time a drawback of 99 per cent

MAY 29, 1952
is payable on spirits used for scientific purposes only by "any scientific and research
laboratory sponsored by the government of
Canada or by the government of any
province". The amendment makes clear what
kind of government assistance constitutes
sponsorship. This is done by repealing paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of section 140 of
the Act and substituting a new paragraph
(a), which specifles that the drawback is
payable "to any scientific and research laboratory in receipt annually of aid from the
government of Canada or a province".
The present Act also provides that a drawback of 99 per cent on spirits used for
medicinal purposes only may be paid to any
bona fide public hospital certified to be such
by the Department of National Health and
Welfare. That is provided for in paragraph
(c) of subsection 2 of section 140 of the Act.
The present paragraph is being repealed, and
is replaced by a new paragraph (c), which
makes the drawback on such spirits payable
to any bona fide public hospital or municipal health clinic certified to be such by
the Department of National Health and Welfare. Also a new paragraph (d) is added,
under which entitlement to the drawback
on spirits used for medicinal and research
purposes only is extended to "any health
institution in receipt annually of aid from
the Government of Canada or a province".
Section 5 of the bill repeals section 160 of
the Act and substitutes a new section therefor. The present section 160 restricts, subject to the provisions of the Unfair Competition Act, 1932, the kind of label that
may be placed on a bottle or flask of spirits.
The only change in the new section is to
make this restriction subject to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act also. The
administrators of the Food and Drugs Act
have recently become quite concerned about
various brands of Scotch whisky, and so on,
and have worked out elaborate definitions.
They are particular about what kind of statement is made on the labels on bottles of
whisky.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Are they not going to
be more particular about what is put inside
the bottle as well as about what is put on
the label?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is feared that a very
enticing label on a bottle might induce a
purchaser to make too optimistic assumptions
about the quality of the contents. The authorities want you to know, before you take the
cork out of the bottle, that what is represented
on the outside is really there on the inside.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Very understandable.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Section 6 makes provision
for offences arising out of instances such as
I mentioned in relation to section 4, where
additional persons and institutions are entitled
to drawbacks. If, for instance, a drawback
has been obtained on the representation that
the spirits were to be used for a certain
purpose, or were to be in a certain prescribed
place-both of which give them a quality
which entitles the owner to a drawback-and
the spirits are removed from the place where
it was supposed to have been held, an offence
is provided against the owner of such
spirits, which are "unlawfully or fraudulently
removed from any place where spirits subject
to drawback are held."
Two additional offences appear at the top
of page 3. These have to do with spirits:
(g) that have been released from excise bond
exempt from duty as being for the use of a person
or organization by law entitled to such exemption
but which spirits have been subsequently sold or

otherwise disposed of to a person not entitled to
any exemption; or
(h) that have been released from excise bond
either free or at a reduced rate of duty for a s.pecific
use and have been subsequently diverted to a use
other than that for which the exemption was given.

Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator what is the meaning of the words
"the proof whereof shall be upon the person
accused" appearing on page 2, line 33?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They simply mean that
the person who is accused will have to prove
that he was entitled to do what he is charged
with having done. In other words, this
section puts the onus of proof on the accused.
There is nothing new in that, for there are
many sections in the Excise Tax Act which
place upon the accused the onus to prove
that he has not committed an offence.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How does a person go about
getting exemption for the possession of
spirits?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If my friend wanted an
exemption, he would have to establish a
health institution which enjoyed an annual
grant from the Canadian government or from
one of the provinces, and use the spirits for
medical and research purposes only. In that
way he would qualify for a 99 per cent drawback. I should point out, however, that the
spirits on which he would be entitled to this
drawback would be not less than 50 per cent
overproof.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I guess I would not ýqualify.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: On page 3 of the bill
are set out the penalties for the offences which
I have just described. These include forfeiture. The amending words are merely
extensions of language now in the Act.
Section 7 of the bill deals with the making
of homebrew. The ordinary method of making

SENATE
this product is from malt, after having secured
a licence or a letter of consent from the
nearest customs or excise official. As long as
the maker did not make more than he required for himself and his family, he could go
on his merry way; but if he sold some of the
product, he would be committing an offence
under the Act. In the progress of science
extracts have been discovered from which
beer can be made without the process of
brewing. All that this section does is to add
the words "makes or" to the original section
178.
The present section reads:

I should like to draw the attention of the
house to items 5 and 6 in the schedule, which
appeared on page 6 of the bill. They are as
follows:

of the bill.

MAY 29, 1952
Hon. Mr. AseIfine: I don't know whether
I want to speak on it; I do flot know much
about it yet.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I assure you I will do
the best I can to complicate what is already
complicated!
Hon. Mr. Haig: 1 suggest that the honourable senator make his speech now and that
the debate be adjourned until Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. Farris: You can move the adj aurament afterwards.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: This bill deals with certain arnendments to the Dominion Succession
Duty Act, some of them highly technical.
1 do flot know how many times in a year
or a lifetime the conditions to which they
apply might occur, but 1 venture to say that
it would flot be often, because most wills
are simple in their structure, and these provisions relate to more complicated wills which
contaîn general powers of appointment and
things of that kind. I will do my best to
iaformi you of what I believe to be the intent
of the amendments.
Section 1 is, of course, merely a "'tidyingup". The Income Tax Act is given its proper
name where it occurs in section 2, paragraph (i) of the Succession Duty Act. It was
formerly referred to as "the Income War
Tax Act."
Section 2 of the bill contains three subsections having to do with section 3 of the
present Succession Duty Act. This section,
which is under Part I of the Act, "Dispositions Deemed to be Included in a Succession", was, as regards subsection 1 (j), the
subi ect of a decision in the Quebec courts,
as a resuit of which the present amendments
have been drafted. The new paragraph (j)
reaffirms or re-states the law as the court
stated it to be under the old paragraph (j);
aad paragraphs (ja) and (jb) are added to
cover situations which were held flot to be
included in the original paragraph (j). As
I understand the facts, i the case in point,
a marriage settiement was made maay years
ago, but the paymeats thereunder were to
fail in only upon the death of the settlorthe person who entered into the marriage
settlement.
The Quebec courts held that
these subsections of section 3 of the Act were
mutually exclusive; that subparagraph (j) 15
where you «"stay put" as regards the application of subsection 3 to marriage settiements,
and because they are mentioaed in that
paragraph, no other subsection is applicable.
They further held that because the marriage
settiement was entered into so many years
ago, even though payment did flot fail in
until the death of the settior, the payment
was excluded fromn the succession, it did not
f orm any part of it. The department decided
55708-23

that this was not the intention of the law,
and accordingly prepared the amendment now
before us.
The purpose of the new paragraph (j), therefore, is simply to re-state the content of the
original paragraph (j), namely, that property
transferred to or settled on any person by a
deceased in consideration of marriage within
three years prior to the death of the deceased
is iacluded within the succession period.
Paragraph (ja) includes within the succession, as a resutpreperty agreed to be transferred to or settled on
-any person by the deceased under an agreement
made by the deceased under an agreement made
in consideration of marriage at any time before or
after the coming Into force of this paragraph, to
the extent that the property agreed to be transferred or settled was actually transferred or settled
within three years prior te or on or after the
death of the deceased.

It will be noted that this terminology covers

the type of case which was considered by
the Quebec courts and held not to be covered
by the original paragraph (j).
Paragraph (jb) covers the type of marriage
settlement where there is a reservation of
benefit for ife or a period determinable by
reference to the death of the settior. In these
circumstances the property covered by a settlement with such reservation is made a part
of the succession.*
The sum total of these paragraphs, if they
become law, is that only those marriage
settlements actually executed or fulfilled more
than three years before the death of the
settior or the transferor are entitled to be
excluded from the provisions of section 3,
and so not to be iacluded in the succession.
Hon. Mr. Davies. Does that mean that a
settiement made three years prior to death
will not be subject to succession duty?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If the settiement were
actually executed or fulfilled more than three
years prior to death. By that 1 mean that
such property was transferred, so that the
transaction was completed.
Ia that same ceanection we should consider
section 4, which forbids the deduction of the
marriage settlemeat debts or allowances in
determiniag the correct net or dutiable value
of the estate. la paragraph (ja), and also in
section 4 which I have been talking about,
they use very broad language. Paragrapb
(ja) reads:

on any persan by the deceased under an agreemrent made in censideration cf marriage, at any
time befere or after the ceming bInto ferce cf this
paragraph, te the extent that the property agreed

or alter the death of the deceased;

The same lan4 guage ia used in section 4,
and it has a retroactive effect. I have been

SENATE

advised by the departmental officers that with
respect to any person dying after these provisions come into force the retroactive effect
would then apply to any deeds relating to any
settlements that have been set up by such
person. I understand that the bill will go
to committee, so the only question I raise at
this time is that the retroactive effect might
be broader than this. Having regard to the
broad language, "at any time before or after
the coming into force of this paragraph . . ."
the retroactive effect might conceivably go
back and affect settlements concluded many
years before. If such wide-sweeping retroactive effect exists, we might want to add
something in committee which would make
clear the meaning intended by the department-that it applies to deeds and settlements,
and so on, created by persons who will die
after these sections come into force.
The next item with which I wish to deal
is probably more complicated than the item
of marriage settlements, but I shall try to
outline it as briefly and clearly as possible.
On page 2 of the bill are to be found the
sections dealing with the general power of
appointment. These sections provide for
what happens on the death of a person who is
entitled to exercise the general power of
appointment, or in the event of the death of
the creator of the general power of appointment.
Let me illustrate this in my own language.
Let us assume that a person has a general
power of appointment in relation to a certain
property, and that he dies without exercising
it. For the purposes of determining the succession in respect to such property, the person
who is entitled to the benefit of that exercise
of power will be the "successor" and the
person who dies will be the "predecessor".
Now, then, let us take a case where the
creator of the general power dies. I know this
is complicated but perhaps I can simplify it.
Let us say that a person creates by an instrument in writing or in his will a general power
of appointment in relation to some of his property, and this is to be exercised by that person. Should the creator of the power die
before the power is exercised, the donee of the
power becomes the "successor", the creator
becomes the "predecessor", and the property
becomes part of the succession and is subject
to tax. I do not know whether I have made
myself very clear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is the meaning of
inter vivos?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Inter vivos is an instru-

ment entered into by living people, as distinct from a will, which takes effect only on
death.

At the top of page 2 it will be seen that
paragraph (k) of subsection (1) of section 3
of the Act is repealed and a new paragraph
(k) is substituted. The change is not great,
but in order to explain it I shall have to tell
you what the subsection does. It provides
that:
property transferred within three years prior to
the death of the deceased for partial consideration
in money or money's worth paid-

The present section contains the word "paid"
and the amendment adds:
-- or agreed to be paid to the deceased, to the
extent to which the value of the property when
transferred exceeds the value of the consideration
so paid or agreed to be paid;

That means that if a person within three
years prior to his death transfers property
for a consideration which is less than the
true value of the property which he has
conveyed or agreed to convey, and in respect
of which there is an agreement to pay, the
value of the property when it was transferred
-not the partial consideration which purported to be the consideration-is what forms
a part of the succession and is included in the
aggregate net value of the estate for succession tax purposes. The only addition is the
words "agreed to be paid".
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the honour-

able senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Suppose I sell a piece
of property to my son or daughter for a
stated consideration, and within three years
of my death that consideration has been
paid. Do you mean to say that the succession
duty official can come along and say that
that consideration is not the true value of the
property, and: that the difference between
the true value and what has been paid is part
of my estate, and therefore subject to succession duty?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. That sort of transaction was already covered under paragraph
(k) of subsection (1) of section 3 of the Succession Duty Act. They have added the case
where you agree to make certain payments
and have not completed them. It covers the
situation whether you have paid or have
agreed, to pay. I am gladi you raised this
question, because something has been bothering me in connection with this section, and I
may as well put the red lantern on this item
now. In the case of a father dealing with his
son, we can appreciate, under the income tax
law, the reason for going back to determine
a consideration paid and the true value of
the property when transferred. Now, it seems
to me that this subsection has sufficient scope
to deal with transactions that are conducted

MAY 29. 1952
at arm's length, where the person conveying
the propertY made a foolish deal. We have
always said that if a person is in possession
of his senses and he makes. a foolish deal he
alone is responsible. Should the law go so far
as to say that if in these circumrstances I
drive a goocl bargain, the Succession Duty
Branch rnay within three years of the death
of the person frora whom I acquired the
property decide that it had a higher value
than I paid for it, and that the estate of the
deceased be increased, by the amount of the
extra value placed upon the property, or
should the section be restricted to transactions between parties who are not at arm's
length? I tbrow that out merely as a thought
for consideration in comsnittee.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What do you yourself
think? Do you flot think the language is
wide enough, to cover a case where the parties are aît arrn's length?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Frankly, it appears to
me to be wide enough to cover a transaction
o~f that kind. If the departmental representatives tell us in committee that it is no't
intended to have that wide application, a
very simple way of making sure would be
by putting in some qualifying language.
The other amendment that I wished to
refer to is the new suibsection (6) of section
3 of the Act, which is added by subsection
(4) 0f section 2 of the 'bill, on -page 2. That
subsection is intended to cover a case where
a man makes an agreenment to seil property
for a certain price, the agreement to become
effective upon or after his death. The purpose of the subsection is thaýt, if the property
sold in such a transaction has been undervalued, the difference between the price
stipulated in the agreement and the fair
market value shal ibe deemed to be a succession. The language used in the subsection is this:

There are two points here. First there
is the question whether the subsection is
intended to be or should be limited by sorne
qualification to arm's length transactions.
Secondly, there is the wide scope of the language relating to any agreement made before or after the coming into force of this
subsection, and the question arises whether,
application of the subsection is to be limited
to persons who die after this amendment
cornes into force or whether it is to relate
to any transaction that was made at any
time while the Succession Duty Act itself has
been in force.
Section 3 of the bull adds nothing new. It
simply tidies up matters, by includinig provisions of the 'Income Tex Act as well as 0f
the Income War Tax Act.
1 have already deait with section 4.
Section 5 is a relieving amendment, and
therefore I know you will find this interesting and acceptable. It repeals the present
paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 11
of -the Act and substitutes a new paragraph
(b) theref or. A schedule to the Succession
Duty Act sets out various rates applicable to
the dutiable value of an estate, depending
upon the relationship of the persons receiving the estate. These rates are divided into
-classes A, B, C and D, class A beîng applicable to a close relative, such as a widow or
child; classes B and C to other groups 0f
relatives; and class D to, relatives in any
other group and to strangers in blood to the

Duty Office gives for succession duty paid to
a province. The credit is computed as fohhows: it is either one-haif of the succession

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I was about to say
that although the succession duty regulations
may appear comphicated to the layman, there
are two things he can do while he is stilh
alive by which, between the combined abilities of himsehf and bis lawyer, he mnay be
able to make a simple disposition in bis
will and thereby avoid complications that
might otherwise follow.
Hon, Mr. Duff: Why not leave it all to the
lawyers, and be done with it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That might be a very
good idea, and I wouhd heartily support it.
But I would point out that the money a man
pays bis lawyer to prepare a proper will
wilh be saved many times over, and the
complications will be avoided.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The lawyers ail agree.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I turn now to section 7
of the bill, and here I must make a small
query. I do not say that my view is the
correct one, but nevertheless I have a view on

MAY 29, 1952
it. Section 7 would provide for fair market
value in these words:
The fair market value af anl property shail be
determined for the purpases of this Act without
allowance or deduction for income tax.
That means that if the estate of a deceased
person was made Up of, for instance, a number of shares in a private company which
were flot listed on any stock exchange, the
question would inevitably arise as to the
determination of the aggregate net value and
dutiable value of the estate. This proposed
new section, in effect, says that if, in such a
case as I have mentioned an attempt is made
to arrive at a fair market value, no deduction
or allowance is made for income tax. We know
that if there is a surplus ini the company
whose shares are held, and that surplus adds
to the value of the shares held, one cannot
realize the full amount of the surplus, the
reason being that if the dividends had been
taken, income tax would have been paid at
the applicable rate and the amount to be
received would thereby have been reduced.
On the other hand, under section 95A of the
Income Tax Act-which we had before us
a couple of years ago-one could dlean out
the surplus up to the year 1949 and create
a tax-paid surplus by paying 15 per oent tax
ta the government, or one could dlean out
the accumulation of surplus income in each
year by declaring dividends in the amount of
50 per cent of the earnings of the year and
paymng 15 per cent tax on the balance, and
either take it out or leave it in.
The principle laid down here for determining fair valuation ignores completely the
amount by which such shares or assets may
be reduced as a resuit of the application of
income tax. If one were buying shares in
such a company as I have used for purposes
of illustration, he would certainly give some
consideration to the effect of taxation on the
purchase price. It is my own personal view
that the stock market price would sooner or
]ater give some indication of the net value
of the asset behind the share. However, that
matter can be gone into in committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is that a new principle?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The principle is not new,
but it is new in the statute. As a matter of
fact, I understand that the department has
made use of it as a rule or practice, but it is
now being given the force of law.
Section 8 deals with the valuation of annuities, and provides for the use of a mortality
table. Annuities are most difficult to evaluate.
If a deceased has created certain annuities
during his lifetime, and it becomes necessary
to arrive at their value, there must be some
yardstick. Under section 8, that yardstick
would be a mortallty table.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But there are several
types of mortality tables.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is true, but the provisions here are very broad. The section
reads as follows:
The value of every anxiuity, termn of years, l1fe
estate. incarne, or other estate. and of every interest
in expectancy shall for the purposes of this Act be
determined by such rule. method and standard, of
martality and of value, and at such rate of interest
as frorn time ta tirne the Minister rnay decide, and
the value so determined shail ba deemned to be the
f air mnarket value thereof.
I presuma that the Minister would exercise
reasonable discration in selecting a mortality
table. Ha would not select ari antiquated table
or one that was not now in use by the
insurance companias or the trust companies.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Would there be an appeal
under this section?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: An appeal is provided
for in the Act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But this section uses
the words,
...
the value sa determined shail be deemed ta be
the fair mnarket value thereof.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: There are provisions for
appeal in the Act; whether there is an appeal
from. this particular section in the Act, I
cannot at the moment say. Speakinig broadly,
I recali the old Pioneer Laundfrh case, in
which the axercisa of discretion as ta value
for depreciation purposes was deait with. I
think that case on two diffarent occasions
went as far as the Privy Clouncil. The first
appeal was taken because the Mînister refused
ta allow any depreciation on the basis, that,
having regard to the vendor and purchaser,
there was no change, and no depraciation was
allowed,. I believe there was a sale from a
holder of property or business to the company,
at a price by which the value would be reinstated and, dapreciation would start to run ail
over agamn.
In the first instance tha deputy minister
refused ta allow any depreciation. This decision was heid not to, be an exercise of
discretion. Subsequently ha arbitrarily made
a nominal allawance-I think it was a dollar
or same such amaunt-for dapreciation. This
also was held nat to be an exercise of discretion. Sa the discretion exercisable is not
absolute, though it might appear ta be.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The question is whether
this. is an "axercisa."
Han. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a question
,with regard to power to appoint? As I undarstand the explanation, it seems exiraardinary.
Arn I ta understand that when, by will or
inter vivos, someone givas a power of appointment, and dies before that power has been

SENATE
exercised, the holder becomes the successor
and is liable for succession duty on the
property affected?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. What I said was, the
donee of the power, the person who would be
entitled to exercise.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is, the person who
makes the will.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, the donee of the
power would become the successor; the
deceased, the creator of the power, would
become the predecessor, and the property
which was the subject-matter of that instrument would be part of the succession and
would be taxable in the estate of the
deceased.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In the hands of the donee?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, in the estate. If the
donee dies without having exercised the
power, the property becomes taxable in his
estate.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend if these amendments are final, or if it
is to be understood-I heard something to
that effect-that there will be a new Succession Duty Act next year or the year
following?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: All I know about that is
that the minister in another place gave
some indication that it was about time to
embark on the revision of the Succession
Duty Act. I have heard nothing further,
nor do I believe there is anything afoot from
which one could conclude that such a revision is actively going on.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The only obseravtion I
have to make is that I think some revision of
the Succession Duty Act is in order. My
honourable friend appears to have given a
very lucid explanation of these amendments,
but since I am not learned in the law, I am
bound to say that it passed several feet over
my head. It should be possible to have an
Act governing succession duties which the
ordinary man of average intelligence could
begin to understand. I may be wholly wrong,
but it is my impression that what we are
getting here is very involved and complicated
piece of legal machinery. Surely it is possible
to devise a simpler way of dealing with this
matter. This measure leaves me with the
impression that the people who drafted it
did not know what they were about, were
confused themselves, and carried that confusion into the legislation which they submit
to parliament.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I wish to congratulate
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) on the very fine explanation he
has given. Having had some experience in

succession duty matters, I flatter myself that
I know a little about the Succession Duty Act,
and I was able to follow quite clearly his
explanation of the bill. I had intended to
move the adjournment of the debate, but
in view of the honourable senator's very
fine exposition I think that, if the bill goes
to committee, I can find answers to some questions that I wish to ask and about which the
honourable senator himself does not seem any
too clear. I do not object to second reading
at this time and to reference of the bill to
a committee.
Hon. John T. Haig: But for the remarks of
the honourable member for Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) I would not have said anything,
but in view of what he has said, I must
candidly admit that I do not agree with him.
I believe that practically any layman can
take the Succession Duty Act and file papers
with an approximately correct assessment of
the duty payable. Lawyers, who as a rule
are not expert accountants, are often called
to prepare these documents. One good thing
about the legislation is the effort to frame it
as definitely as possible, because this makes
for the protection of the public against the
officials.
The honourable member from Toronto
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) raised a question
which has been troubling me for a long time.
A will is drawn in which a testator gives his
widow a life interest in the total income, or
part of it, and at her death the estate ordinarily goes to the children. On what basis is
succession duty determined as allocable to
the widow's life estate and to the estate of
the remainderman? The estate, of course, is
subject to the duty which, if the beneficiary
is the widow, she would pay, and there is
an amount applicable to the reversionary
estate, which may go to her children.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It all goes out at the
one time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is a matter of settlement
between the two interests. I can speak only
of the practice in Manitoba, but I believe it
applies to other provinces. When a lawyer is
engaged to draw a will, whether a trust company or some individual is named as the
executor, it is usual to advise the testator to
be careful, if the beneficiary is the wife, and
to remind him that perhaps in five or ten or
fifteen years, when she dies, there will be
succession duty to pay all over again upon
the property devolving upon the children or
grandchildren. In such cases the matter of
the division of the tax between the widowwhen she takes the life estate-and the
remainderman has become quite important.
I have never been satisfied with the basis on
which the department works in determining

MAY 29, 1952
the life estate of the widow. I presume they
have the same actuarial table as the life
insurance companies commonly use: that a
person of sixty has a life expectancy of ten
or twelve years, and that a person of seventy
bas a much shorter life expectancy.
If my honourable friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) would spend a few months
in a law office he would soon realize the great
importance of having the provisions of the
Succession Duty Act put in terms that are
legally correct. This sort of thing should not
be left to guesswork. As some of my colleagues have pointed out, lawyers want these
words to say what they mean when these
matters are contested in the courts.
Let me give an illustration of a case that
went all the way to the Supreme~ Court of
Canada. A man died and left the income of
his estate to his widow, with power to the
executor to use 5 per cent of the capital if
she required it. There was no dispute over
this point. The remainder of the estate went
to a nephew and a niece on the deceased's
side, and to a niece on the widow's side. The
assets actually consisted of stocks in an
Ontario shoe company. The deceased died
around 1936 or 1937, at which time the company was realizing only 4 per cent profit on
its capital; but from the year 1920 on it had
set aside a surn of money annually and had
created a large reserve. The dividends of
the company clirnbed fast when war orders
started pouring in from all over the country
around 1940, and eventually the dividends
rose from 4 to 10 per cent. The outcome was
that counsel acting for the remaindermen
of the estate claimed that the widow could
receive dividends of only 4 per cent. There
was some question as to whether the investment in the shoe stock was trust investment
under the Act. The case finally went to the
Supreme Court, where it was held that only
4 per cent could be given to the widow, and
so the rest of the estate was awarded to the
remaindermen. In this case the exactness of
the language of the Act was of great help to
the lawyers in working out a settlement.
Honourable senators, I think that the
actuarial table used by the department to
determine the life estate of the widow should
be specially set out, so that there can be no
misunderstanding. This table has varied in
the past. It will be recalled that the Annuities Act was based on a certain actuarial
table of life expectancy, and the Deputy
Minister of Labour told us in committee that
he jumped the new rates, basing them on an
increased life expectancy of four years. When
we come to this section in committee I am
going to find out from the departrnental
officials what table or system they use. I am
sure that insurance companies like the Sun

Life, the London Life, the Great West Life,
and the Dominion Life, use an accurate and
up-to-date table in making these adjustinents.
Honourable senators, I am pleased that the
bill is going to committee, and in closing I
want to say that I wish I had the ability to
explain a bill as oapably as the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden).
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 288, an Act for granting
to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1953.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
request for further interim supply for the
public service of the present financial year.
The bill provides for the usual one-twelfth
of all items to be voted in the Main Estimates
for the fiscal year 1952-53, and the general
proportion of one-twelfth for all services
is intended to provide for ordinary requirements to the end of June.
In addition to providing the usual onetwelfth of all items, the bill provides additional proportions for a few special items,
fourteen in all, which are necessary as a
result of heavy seasonal expenses for certain
services. These items appear in the schedule
to the bill. Two items in the special category
requiring proportions in addition to the onetwelfth also appear in the schedule, and I do
not think I need outline what these are.
I should refer the honourable house to
the statement I am authorized to make on
behalf of the government, as acting leader,
and which has been made in this house on
other occasions. The usual undertaking is
given that the passage of this bil will ins
no way prejudice the rights and privileges of
honourable senators to criticize and discuss
any item in the Estimates which may come up
for consideration from time to time throughout the remainder of the session. Such rights
and privileges will be respected, and will not

SENATE
be curtailed or restricted in any way as a
result of this measure having been passed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do I understand that
this simply allows us to talk about it? What
about objecting to it and refusing to pass it?
We are giving now one-twelfth of some item;
when the item comes before us at some subsequent period, according to your undertaking,
we can do a lot of talking but can we refuse
to pass the item

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do think we ought to
have the bill here and be able to see it
before we give it the third reading. It does
seem to me a remarkable procedure to bring
in one or two copies of a bill after our sitting begins, and then give the bill first,
second and third 'readings before we have
had a chance to read it. I do not think it
is necessary to do that sort of thing.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the

second reading of Bill 209, an Act to amend
the Customs Tariff.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill contains a list of miscellaneous items in respect
of which tariff changes have been made, and
new items which have been added. The
changes are in accordance with the announcement made by the Minister of Finance in his
budget speech.
Even if I were able to do so, I do not think
much would be gained by entering into a
detailed discussion of these items, so when
the bill has been given second reading, I
intend to move that it be referred to committee, where it can be studied in detail.
Nevertheless, it may be of use to give a general outline of the contents, of the bill, and to
comment generally on one or two of the items.
I have prepared myself for a question
which is often asked by my free-trade col-

SENATE
leagues on this side of the house, namely,
what is the general effect of these tariff
changes. The changes cover a wide variety
of items: in some instances provision is made
for withdrawal of the 99 per cent drawback.
I would not make the sweeping statement
that the changes will result in no increase in
tariffs; in an effort to maintain the British
Preference standing, some minor increases
may creep in; but I am advised that in general the .changes will result in no increases
in tariff and that in many items there is a
decrease.
I now refer specifically to the bill, which
honourable senators will note is divided into
three parts.
Part I of the schedule implements the
recommendations of the Tariff Board on
fiat glass and synthetic resins. Both of these
items were referred to the Tariff Board at
one time or another for study, as a consequence of changing conditions and new processes and of manufacture in Canada, and
on March 22, 1949, the Minister of Finance
referred the whole synthetic resin and plastic
schedule to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. In their report to the
government the board make specific recommendations for the creation of new items, and
classify them. I am advised that, apart from
the qualification I have mentioned, no
increases are recommended. My understanding is that, duties on synthetic resins previously ranged from the free list to a maximum, in some few cases, of 20 per cent,
and that any changes now put forward are
within that compass.
This part of the
schedule comprises eight items dealing with
synthetic resins in various forms, several
items covering cellulose plastics, two items
relating to laminated and reinforced plastics,
one having to do with regenerated cellulose,
two covering protein plastics, and three
relating to raw materials. The recommendations of the board are implemented in items
numbered 901 to 923 inclusive. Preceding
items cover ordinary window glass and sheet
glass.
I would draw the attention of honourable
senators to the following paragraph of the
board's report on the subject of synthetic
resins:
The board does not, in this report, recommend
rates of duty which will apply when goods not now
made in Canada begin to be produced in this
country. The board is aware that industry is concerned lest low or free rates on goods now manufactured in Canada may become bound against
increase under international agreeement. In view
of the rapidity with which this industry is developing and changing, the board recommends that those
responsible for Canada's tariff policy bear this point
in mind when undertaking international negotiations or, indeed, when new materials in this field
are produced in quantity in Canada.

It is estimated that the total imports during
1951 of synthetic resins and plastics covered
by the Tariff Board report were worth
between $43,000,000 and $45,000,000, and that
about 95 per cent of these came from the
United States. Most of the products imported
under the items referred to were exempt from
customs duty, and it is estimated that the
total duty collected on all imports amounted
to 5 per cent ad valorem. So much for
Part I.
Part II of the bill contains eighty-nine
items, comprising twenty-seven new tariff
items calling for tariff reductions; seven
items on which existing rates have been
reduced; forty-six items amended to provide
for additional products, and nine which do
not precisely fall in any of the other groups.
I am advised that the twenty-seven new
tariff items are taken from what are generally referred to as "basket" items, which
cover a whole group of goods. Duties have
been attached to these new items, but I
understand that they are lower than they
were in the corresponding "basket" items
in which they had previously been placed.
It is my understanding with respect to the
forty-six items which have been amended to
provide for additional products, that the
department has acted upon certain of the
many representations made to them.
It
has been found desirable to specifically
enumerate these items.
Part III of the scheduleHon. Mr. Reid: Before the honourable
senator .proceeds with part III, I should like
to ask him a question. I would refer him
to tariff item 105c, "Olives, sulphured or in
brine, not bottled". Then it says, "On and
after July 1, 1953-10 per cent-174 per
cent-30 per cent". Is it not something new
to set up a tariff that will not become operative until a date more than a year later?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As I have said, I am
not in a position to give more than a general outline of this measure. I am afraid my
honourable friend will have to secure this
information he desires in committee from the
officials of the department.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would also refer the
leader to Tariff Item 436 which relates to
locomotives and railway passenger, baggage
and freight cars. If these are the property
or under the control of railway companies
in the United States, and are running upon
any line or road crossing the frontier, they
can be admitted free so long as Canadian
locomotives and cars are admitted free under
similar circumstances into the United States.

as possible for the current needs of these
organizations, awaiting the time when they
will assume larger proportions in a physical
sense than they do today. When the time
comes for the actual erection of the National
Library building, or the National Art Gallery,
a special item will appear in the annual
estimates to cover the necessary expenditure,
and no doubt parliament will further discuss
the matter. Meanwhile, this bill deals with
the outline of establishment of a so-called
national library.
It is hardly necessary for me to define the
meaning of "national library" to this bouse.
The need for such an institution has been
emphasized continuously and with an increasing degree of unanimity, over the .past twenty
years. The Canadian Library Association,
which embraces the principal library centres
throughout Canada, has emphasized the
importance of establishing a national library
in Canada as soon as possible. The Joint
Committee on the Library of Parliament has
from time to time made similar representations. One should not overlook the recent
recommendations of the Royal Commission on
National Development of the Arts, Letters and
Sciences. These bodies reflect the demands
which have been heard during the past years.
This bill received most generous attention in
the other place, and was passed unanimously.
I commend to honourable senators a reading of the report of the Advisory Committee
on the National Library. It contains in
briefest outline what is set out in this bill.
In the words of the Prime Minister, when he
spoke in the other house, a national library
should be the most comprehensive library in
the world relating to its own country. In
reaching such an objective, Canada's National
Library will co-operate with other government libraries and general library institutions
throughout Canada. The National Library
will be required to house books and documents of its own; it will be a comprehensive
office of reference for all kinds of information about Canada; it will become a Canadian
bibliographic centre, with a national catalogue
recording an index of books, papers and
documents in all parts of Canada. The work
of cataloguing and establishing a bibliographie centre has already begun. It will in
time serve not only the government and
members of parliament in Ottawa, but the
reading public, wherever public libraries and
their interested subscribers may be located.
We have in Ottawa the Library of Parliament, the Public Archives and the special
libraries of the various departments of government. In these repositories for books and
papers there is much crowding and considerable need for sorting and reclassification. The Parliamentary Library, as almost

everyone knows, is very much overcrowded
by reason of having to care for a vast stock
of old, rare and very valuable books and
papers, which should be housed in some
safer place. The National Library, when
built, will relieve the Parliamentary Library
of that responsibility.
Although the Parliamentary Library is
perhaps generally regarded as Canada's
national library, its cramped quarters and
added responsibilities have prevented it from
providing students and readers with adequate accommodation in the form of nooks
and rooms in which to pursue studies. The
removal of the excess material from the
Parliamentary Library will enable it to
give much more useful service to members
of parliament.
The Public Archives finds itself in much
the same unhappy position as the Library
of Parliament. One of the first things to be
done in Ottawa is to co-ordinate and harmonize the local units, so that the National
Library will be able to give service to the
Archives, and that branch in turn will be
able to operate more efficiently.
For the past two years the nucleus of a
National Library organization has taken form
under the direction of Dr. Kaye Lamb, the
Public Archivist, who as a result of this
bill will also become our first National Librarian. Some ten to twelve trained personnel under his direction have set up what
has been called a bibliographie centre, and
have also compiled a catalogue of some two
million books which are located in the various
government libraries in Ottawa. This work
will continue until all the reference material
available in Canadian libraries bas been
indexed and made convenient for purposes
of reference.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: How long will that
take?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The work is now under
way. As I have said, two years have been
spent on it here in Ottawa; and the estimate
which appears in this report is that it will
take five years to complete a catalogue which
will be representative of the available Canadiana in this country.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Does that mean that
it will be five years before we get started?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I have tried to explain
that we have already started. We have
spent two years in getting started, but the job
is a vast one, and the equipment to deal
with it is rather limited; so, as was stated in
the other house and by the Advisory Committee on the National Library, it will take
five years to produce an adequate catalogue

JUNE 2, 1952
and index of available books of reference.
As a matter of fact, the work of the National
Library is actually in operation; but it is
preparatory, awaiting the day when a suitable
building can be erected to house these central
activities which, as I have indicated, will
extend from one end of this country to the
other. If a student, a group of students or a
library is interested in securing a work of
reference from the National Library, that
publication will be sent to the library in
Vancouver, Calgary, or elsewhere, where it
is wanted, and there it will be made available.
Likewise, if some historical work or document in the possession of any of these outlying libraries is required here for attention or
study, arrangements will be made to have it
transferred on loan.
Another feature of the work of the library
is microfilming, whereby rare and valuable
books can be made easily accessible whereever they are required by students.
As I have said, all this awaits the day when
suitable premises can be provided, and I do
not think it is too much to say at this time
that, until that day arrives, our much vaunted
Canadianism will be sorely lacking in one
of its chief supports and one of its main
sources of inspiration.
I have been very much interested in this
subject for a long time. If I go to Washington, or am fortunate enough to travel to
London, I see the wonders of the Congressional Library or the British Museum; I
reflect upon Canada's great position in the
world-the third largest trading nation, the
greatest supplier of aluminum and of pulp
and paper-and am tempted to think that,
unless an appraoch is made to the provision
here of a similar institution, we may fairly
be charged with that malady which, when it
affects adolescents, is described as arrested
development.
That is about all I need to say in recommending the passing of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Could the honourable
senator tell us where it is proposed to place
the library, and about how much it will cost?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I know of no definite
decision as to the location of the building; but
in so far as the Federal District Commission
and Mr. Greber are concerned, not to mention those who are interested in the library
itself an area on the river bank at the end of
Bank street, just past the old Supreme Court
Building, is considered to be most desirable.
One reason is that this site is on solid rock,
and would permit of deep excavations to
provide for safe and secure stockrooms and
other accommodation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck:, And fireproof.

Mr. Lambert: Yes, protected from fire or
bombs or other risks. So far there has been
no other indication as to a site, and I suppose
that when the time comes to pass an estimate
to provide for this building, it will probably
be located there.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I suppose there is as
yet no estimate of the cost?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No estimate of the cost
at all.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Who will have the final say
as to the site of the library?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think my honourable
friend and the rest of us who are members
of parliament will have the final say in committee, but the recommendations of the Federal District Commission or the National City
Planning Commission will probably go a long
way towards influencing our opinion.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It will likely be settled
by that gentleman from Paris!
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I
think we should all be extremely gratified
that this measure has been introduced.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vien: As the honourable mover
has so aptly said, it is much overdue. If you
visit the capital of any civilized state-not
merely the old countries of Europe, where
such institutions were established centuries
ago, but Mexico, Brazil, Argentine, Uruguay
and other Latin-American republics-you
will find that among its most elaborate
monuments is the public library. These
countries take great pride in the architectural, cultural and educational value of their
national libraries. I recall that when I was
Speaker of the Senate, and Co-Chairman of
the Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament, our committee received delegations
from all parts of Canada urging the building
of a National Library. In 1943 or 1944 I was
largely instrumental in having the Senate
approve a resolution, later passed by the
House of Commons, strongly requesting the
government to establish a national library.
Canada was at war from 1939 to 1945. The
years following have not always been peaceful ones, and the world is still confronted
by grave problems. In view of these circumstances I do not think we should expect the
legislation before us to specify when this
National Library will be constructed. I think
we are proceeding in the right order. The
National Library organization set up two
years ago under the direction of .Dr. Lamb
For
has already done splendid work.
instance, it has greatly modernized the
cataloguing of the Libiary of Parliament.
Honourable senators would find it most

SENATE
interesting to visit the Archives and interview Dr. Lamb, and find out for themselves
just what has been accomplished in this direction. We have to plan our work before working our plan.
An honourable senator from the other side
of the bouse has asked when this work will
be completed. I can tell my honourable
friend that while the work has actually
begun it will never really be finished. The
Library of Congress and the British Museum
were both founded more than a hundred
years ago, but their work is still proceeding.
The work of our National Library will never
be completed as long as the human mind is
active and productive. Such institutions are
matters of pride in the Old World. It would
take a person the better part of a week to
intelligently go through the Bibliotheque
Nationale in Paris, and it would take several
days to make a worth-while visit to the
British Museum in London.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: It would take at least
a year.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, even a year, but a
week or two would enable you to get a fair
idea of the importance of the museum. You
could certainly spend a year in the Library
of Congress without completing your work.
A National Library will certainly be a source
of pride to the people of Canada, and its
research facilities will be of immense advantage to all trades and professions. As the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has pointed out, it will be a centre
of reference not only for Ottawa but for
every part of Canada. We shall be able to
accumulate books that cannot be duplicated,
and provincial libraries will be able to borrow them upon guaranteeing their return.
I wonder if honourable senators know that
the storage vaults right under this very
chamber contain books that were written by
hand, prior to the invention of the printing
press? These books, dating back to the year
1414, are still in their original pigskin bindings. They are priceless, but they cannot be
properly exhibited because of inadequate protective facilities.
When ambassadors and
notables from other countries are shown these
books, they express amazement that we
should own these valuable documents.
Thousands of other volumes are stored in the
vaults of the Library of Parliament, and cannot be shown to the public because of lack
of space in our libraries. These are purely
museum pieces, but there are, besides, a
great number of books of reference that
would assist students in every trade and profession and be extremely helpful to persons
carrying on research of inestimable value to
Canada at large.

Therefore I say that the government is
indeed well advised in taking these first
steps towards the creation of a National
Library, an institution of which we have stood
in need for years and decades. When that
institution becomes a reality, with a properly
equipped building of its own, it will, I am
sure, be a source of pride and usefulness, not
to this capital city alone, but to the whole
country.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I should like to join with the senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) in congratulating the senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) upon his speech in support of this
bill, and to commend all those who have been
working towards the establishment of a
National Library. As the senator from De
Lorimier said, the enterprise has already been
delayed too long.
The senator from Ottawa spoke of the
Library of Congress at Washington. Fairly
recently I had the pleasure and advantage of
going through that library, under the guidance
of one of the head librarians, and to say that
I was impressed is putting it very mildly. It
has miles upon miles of shelves, containing
millions upon millions of books. There are,
if I am not mistaken, some forty reading
rooms, and senators and members of the
House of Representatives are given a service
far greater than it is possible to obtain from
our Library of Parliament.
One of the reasons why I am speaking
on this subject just now is to recall what I was
told in the library at Washington about the
assistance given by the librarian and his
staff to senators and representatives in the
preparation of material for their debates.
There is a committee of highly skilled and
widely informed librarians and writers to
whom any member of the Congress may
apply for consultation and advice, and upon
request a memorandum giving both sides of
any question will be furnished him promptly.
A similar service here would be very valuable to us. I have found the members of
the staff of the Library of Parliament very
courteous and helpful, but for the most part
they are getters of books and putters-away
of books. Some of them have a very extensive knowledge of the books under their
hands, but none are assigned to the specially
helpful purposes which I found so prominent
in the library at Washington of serving as
consultants, advisers and preparers of
material. We could very easily set up such
a -committee, but to do so we would need more
space.
Our library is a very spectactular one. It
has a grand history behind it, for it was saved
from the fire of 1916, and its magnificent

JUNE 2. 1952
dome, higher than Niagara Fails, is very
impressive to visiting tourists. But as a
library it is away behind the times. It is flot
fireproof, it is flot divided into chambers, it
does flot lend itself to any classification of
topie and subject, as a modern building
would.
It should be superannuated and
kept as a prized exhibit.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Can the honourable
senator tell us how many books we have in
that library?
Hon. Mr,. Roebuck: Yes. More than hall a
million books are right on exhibit in our
present library; you can stand there and feel
yourself in the presence of at least that
number of volumes. And that is no smal
accumulation. We need a new Library of
Parliament, and we need it now, quite aside
from the National Library. I do flot say
that to discourage ini any way the building
of a National Library; I am merely pointing
out that our present Lihrary of Parliament
is by no means adequate to the need. We
require consulting rooms and reading rooms.
We now have one big reading room, which in
size is more like a barn than anything else;
we lack comfortable and quiet reading rooms
to which members of either house may retire
for study. The only space available for reading purposes, aside from the big room itself,
is in a few alcoves.
1 feel sure that nobody would support my
remarks more enthusiastically than the
present librarians themselves, who must
realize the inadequacy of their equipment,
except for books, and the need for something
much better. 1 suppose this is a matter for
the attention of the committee, and I fancy it
is badly handicapped because of the lack of
both space and money. If any words of
mine should encourage the committee to be
more insistent on the improving of our
Library of Parliament, I shail feel that my
words have been well chosen.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shail the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Next sitting.
CANADA ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second, reading of Bill 277, an Act to amend
the Canada Elections Act
He said: Hlonourable senators, this bull
seeks a revision o! the salary o! the Chief
Electoral Ofilcer. The present Act provides
tbat he "be paid a salary of flot less than
$8,000,, nor more than $10,000, per -annuin, to

be fixed by order of the Governor in Coundil."
The bill fixes the salary at $12,000, per annum,
and relieves the Governor in Council of
discretionary powers which hie now has under
the present provision. As honourable senators
perhaps know, the bull as introduced in the
other bouse extended the range from $8,000 to
$12,000, but still left the definite amount of
remuneration to be fixed by the Governor in
Council. However, an amendment was offered
to eliminate the discretionary power o! the
Governor in Council and fix the salary definitely at $12,000, and because that amendment
was accepted we have the bull in its present
formn.
I presume that the increase in salary is
to provide better compensation for a new
appointee, who otherwise might not be
appointed at the maximum. It seems reasonable that the position of Chief Electoral Officer should be established by parliament,
rather than le! t to the discretion o! the governor in council. In any event, the amendment was made and the government agreed
to it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader why the bill fixes the retirement age at 65 years? A man of 65 is just
in his prime for an office with the responsibility o! this one. Why should ho not be
ailowed to continue in office until at least 70?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Subi ect to correction,
I may say that this office comes under the
Civil Service Superannuation Act, and is
automatically subject to retirement at 65,
unless hîs termi o! office is specifically extended by the governor in coundil.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then there is no need
for that provision in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Does the bill provide that
an extension may be given in this case?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No; it is -compulsory
retirement at 65 years.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Can he be excluded from
application for extension as provîded under
the Civil Service Superannuation Act?
Hon. Mr.. Roebuck: This bill says that he
shail be compulsorily retired at 65 years.
Mcii. Mr. Vien: If retirement is compulsory, that, is final; but the highest civil
servants can, unýder the Act, have their
retirement deferred, year by year, untfl they
reacli the age o! 70. The same provision
should apply here.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Judges do flot retire
at 65 years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I rise to support the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.

SENATE
Roebuck). I have advocated both publicly
and privately that labour leaders are directing the workers up the wrong path in urging
retirement benefits at an early age. It is a
well known fact that insurance companies
have found that a man who retires at 65,
with his full faculties, does not live longer
than three and a half years. I was pleased
to note by an article published the other day
that one of the great labour leaders in this
country bas come out boldly and frankly
against retirement at 65, and I have before
me a list of seven prominent labour leaders
who are all 65 or older.
I call the attention of honourable senators to this particular subject because we are
now going into social welfare at great
lengths; we are retiring people and giving
them old age assistance benefits at 65 and
universal pension benefits at 70 years. At
the same time we are keeping our boys and
girls in schools and colleges until they are
18 or 20 years of age. This means that the
period of productivity of our nation is
steadily being reduced. It must be remembered that our prosperity depends on production from man's labour.
It should be recognized that most of the
agitation for retirement at 65 comes from
the young; they are apt to think that sorneone is standing in their way of progress, and
they are in a hurry to get ahead. There are
in this country many hundreds of thousands
of people who could still be productive for
years to come. The post office recently
retired a number of its employees. I do not
know how many of thern would have preferred to remain on their jobs until 70 or
75, but I speak against the general policy
of compulsory retirement at 65. I therefore ask, why this bill contains provision
for compulsory retirement at that age.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I may say to my
honourable friend that the bill does not provide anything new in that respect. The proposed amendment has only to do with salary.
Hon. Mr. Reid: As I read the bill it requires
the particular officer to retire at 65.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes; but I am drawing
to the attention of my friend the fact that
that provision has been in the Act all along.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That in itself does not
justify it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am not saying that
it does.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Mr. A. R. Mosher, president
of the Canadian Congress of Labour, said
this:
There are many occupations, however, where the
passage of years does not normally affect the occupant adversely, but, on the contrary, adds to his

proficiency because of his knowledge, stability, and
maturity which years of study and experience alone
can provide.

There are no more loyal people than those
who, while still mentally and physically
healthy, have not been forced to retire. I well
remember that the happiest men I ever met
were those who during the war had been
called back from retirement to places where
their services were required; and they were
most bitter when at the conclusion of hostilities they were dismissed and again had to
return to retirement. I would of course allow
those who are physically or mentally unfit
to retire from their labour at an appropriate
age; but those who are just as keen as they
have ever been in former years should be
allowed to continue to do useful work just
as long as they want to. In this way they
would be happier and healthier, and the
whole country would be the better for it.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is it the intention of the
bouse to send this bill to committee?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Certainly, if that is
desirable.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
in view of the remarks of my honourable
friend, I move that the bill be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I now advise the honourable
leader that when the bill is before the committee I shall try to have the words "compulsorily retired" deleted.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And I shall endeavour
to have "sixty-five years" changed to "seventy
years".
The motion was agreed to.
TARIFF BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 276, an Act to amend
the Tariff Board Act.
He said: This bill honourable senators, seeks
the repeal of subsection (4) of section 4 of the
Tariff Board Act, by which the Governor in
Council may empower the Tariff Board to
conduct inquiries under the provisions of the
Combines Investigation Act. By the Dominion
Trade and Industry Commission Act, 1935,
the members of the Tariff Board were designated members of the Dominion Trade and

JUNE 2, 1952
Industry Commission, and by section 13 of
the same Act the commission was charged
with the administration of the Combines
Investigation Act. Similarly, under subsection
(4) of section 4 of the Tariff Board Act, the
same powers and duties in respect of the
Combines Investigation Act were designated.
In 1937, when the Combines Investigation Act
was being revised by parliament, those sections in the Dominion Trade and Industry
Commission Act entitled "Administration of
the Combines Investigation Act" were
repealed, but the consequential amendment of
the Tariff Board Act was not made. Such
amendment is now effected by this bill, which
repeals the relevant section of the Tariff
Board Act.
Section 2 of the bill would provide for the
vice-chairman of the board a salary of
$12,000 in lieu of the present annual salary
of $10,000; it would provide for the third member of the board a salary of $11,000 in lieu of
the present annual salary of $10,000, and
would delete from the Act the statutory fixation of salary for the secretary of the board.
In this connection I might add that the
salaries of the vice-chairman and third member of the Tariff Board were established in
1931 at $10,000 each per annum. During the
intervening twenty-one years, salaries of comparable positions in the government service
have been adjusted from time to time and the
purpose of the bill is to grant to the vicechairman and the third member the increases
indicated. With regard to the position of secretary of the board, this office since 1948 has
been a classified position under the Civil
Service Act, and the opportunity is taken of
this revision of the Tariff Board Act to
delete the statutory provision.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As, apparently, there
is no requirement that it be sent te a committee, I propose that it be read' the third time
tomorrow.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY
(TERRACE TO KITIMAT) BILL
THIRD READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill 192, an Act respecting the construction of a line of railway by Canadian
National Railway Company from Terrace to
Kitimat, in the province of British Columbia.
Hon. J. W. Stambaugh: Honourable senators, I beg to move the following amendment:
That the bill be not now read the third time, but
that it be amended by deleting clause 9 thereof.

The section in question is as follows:
The Company is not required to fence the right
of way of the railway line and is not liable in
damages by reason only of the absence of fencing.

My objection to this provision is that, in
my opinion, no person or corporation should
be relieved by statute of liability for nonperformance of a duty. Some may say that
I am "stretching the point" by inferring that
it is the duty of the railway company to
build a fence along this proposed line at the
present time. I doubt whether it is necessary
that it be built immediately, but I think that
in future, possibly in the near future, a fence
will be necessary. I am aware that when
the bill was under consideration in committee
the clause was passed; but many other matters came up and took considerable time.
Honourable senators who are members of
the committee will remember that for several
hours we discussed salmon protection and
salmon spawning and the rights of Indians,
and for this reason I believe the section in
question did not receive the attention which
its importance deserved.
The only reason which has been given for
inserting this provision is that it is contained
in the contract for the building of the Lynn
Lake railway. I do not think that there is
or can be any analogy between the country
served by that railroad and the district which
is affected by this bill. The Lynn Lake area
is barren and rocky, and the necessity for
building a fence may be doubled. But probably all the valley land in British Columbia
south of the Old Grand Trunk Pacific Railway
line will be used at some time or other for
agricultural purposes and for the running of
stock. Already we find large herds of cattle
and a certain amount of agricultural production in some of these localities.
As I have said, I do not suggest that the
railway should be required to fence its line
at this time, but the requirement te fence
should not be omitted.
Today, several
hundred miles of the main line are still
unfenced. If they apply to the Board of
Transport Commissioners they may not have
to build a fence, but the Board does not
relieve them of any liability that might result.
I object te relieving the railway of liability by
statute.
A farmer whose stock is run over by a
train finds it difficult to collect damages. I
have had some experience in this. In the
district where I lived some twenty-five years
ago, a farmer had five horses run over by a
train. In those days, as now, the railway
company was compelled by law te build an
adequate fence to keep out stock, and to keep
its cattle-guards in a state of repair se that
the farmers' stock could not climb over them.

SENATE
In any event, in this case the railway company refused to compensate the farmer for
the loss of his cattle, and the farmer sued
the company. After battling the case in
various courts for some three years, the
farmer was finally awarded $650 damages,
but the litigation had cost him over $1,000.
This cured all the farmers, including myself,
and since that time nobody in that district
has sued the railway company for similar
damages. I once had three horses run over
by a train, and the company refused to pay
my claim, but I did not bother to go to court
because I knew it would cost me more than
I could hope to get.
These are some of the reasons why I maintain that we should not relieve the railway
company of liability. We are told that whenever timberland is cleared it makes good
farming land, and so in the not too distant
future many farmers will be settling in the
area around Terrace, and it will be necessary
to fence this property off.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does not the railway
run to Terrace now, passing through several
places?
Hon. Mr. Sfambaugh: You are speaking of
this Kitimat line?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The line that is being
relieved of the necessity of fencing under
this bill.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: As I understand it,
there is no settled area except right at this
end of the line.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that a town?
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: It will be a town of
some 3,000 when the Aluminum plant is
operating.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, it ought to be
fenced off there.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is there not a settlement at Terrace?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Possibly it is fenced
off around Terrace, but I was speaking of the
general line itself. I do not doubt that there
are a few miles right around Terrace that
are already settled.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can you tell us what
the law now is? If this clause is struck out,
is there a provision in the Railway Act
which will place a burden on the railway
company to build a fence?
Hon. Mr. Vien: There is a burden on the
railway companies to fence their right of
way wherever necessary.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is in the Railway
Act?

Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes. A railway company
must apply to the Board of Transport Commissioners to be exempted from fencing its
right of way. On the other hand, any person who thinks a railway company should
fence its right of way can apply to the board
requesting an order to this effect. It may
prove serious to a farmer if the railway
right of way is not fenced off when it is
On the other
adjacent to his land.
hand, I do not think a railway company
should be compelled to build a fence where
one is not necessary. For instance, it may
not be necessary to put up a fence for some
thirty or forty years; but after timber land is
opened up, when farmers settle in a district
it is extremely important to them that the
railway right of way be fenced off; otherwise
their stock may be killed or wander off down
the tracks. I believe it is important that the
railways build fences along their right of way
wherever land is settled.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That seems obvious.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Under the Railway Act the
railway companies are bound to fence their
right of way wherever it is necessary.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I inquire whether
this bill provides that the railway company
shall not be liable for damages if it does not
put up a fence? As I understand it, a railway company, if it has not erected a fence,
is responsible if one of its trains causes
damage to a farmer's stock.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Vien: If a railway company does
not fence its right of way, and causes damage
to cattle, it is responsible. If this section 9 is
enacted, not only will the railway company
be free from its liability, but it may sue a
farmer if any of its equipment is damaged
as a result of collision with the farmer's
stock.
Hon. Mr. Horner: If that is so, I would
certainly endorse the amendment. I know
that country, and there is no comparison
between it and the area through which the
Sherridon-Lynn Lake line runs. If the railway company is relieved of all responsibility,
one can well imagine that it may not be too
particular about causing damage. On the
other hand, if it is liable it might think twice
about putting up a fence.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Even if the railway company is responsible, the non-taxable costs to
a farmer fighting the case in the courts might
exceed the amount of his claim.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Under the common
law a railway company can be held liable
for damages, if proved guilty of negligence.

JUNE 2. 1952
HovYever, a farmer has a fat chance of proving negligence against a railway.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Section 9 of the bull provides that the Canadian National Railway
Company "is not liable in damages by
reason only of the absence o! fencing." That
would prevent anyone from making a dlaim.
against the railway company for damages
caused only by the absence of fencing.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The common law
would still appiy.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I arn advised that the senator from Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) has not concluded his
remarks yet.
Hon. Mr. Starnbaugh: I appreciate greatly
the help I have received from. honourable
senators, and I wish just to make one further brie! comment. If we do relieve the
railway company of responsibility, as provided by section 9, the Board of Transport
Commissioners, even if convinced by some
applicant that fencing was required, would
have no power to compel the company to put
up a fence. On the other hand, if we strike
out this section, the board would be free
to order, or not to order, the building o! a
fence, depending upon what in its judgment is the proper order to make in the
cîrcumstances. One of the reasons why we
have the board is that it may use its discretion in a case of this kind. If we allow
the section to remain in the bull and a farmer's cow happens to get out on the right of
way and be struck by a speeder, the farmer
will probably be liable for damnages for allowing his cow to run loose.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
find myself very much in agreement with
Mr.

Bruce

relieves the railway company from any obligation to fence this Uine from. Terrace to
Kitimat, and in addition relieves it of any
obligation to pay damages to someone who
in future happens to suifer injury by virtue
of the fact that the righ't of way was not
fenced. I understand from, the honourable
gentleman that qulte possibly, in years not
very f ar distant, sorne agricultural country
may be opened up along this Uine by farmers who raise stock. As stated by the senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), the
Railway Aet requires a railway company to
fen-ce its right of way. Why should we relieve the Canadian National Railway Company of that obligation over the line from
Terrace to Kiti-mat for ail time to corne? Why
not, as suggested by the senator from Bruce

(Hlon. Mr. Stamibaugh), leave the discretion
with the Board of Transport CSmm-issioners?
A provision similar to section 9 was, as
I recali, placed in the bill that we passed a
year ago authorizing the Canadian National
to build a Uine from. Sherridon to Lynn Lake,
but the country through which that line
runs could neyer by any stretch of the
imagination be regarded as agricultural country. Consequently, in order to make doubly
sure that the railway company would neyer
be called upon to go to the expense of fencing,
a special exemption from fencing was provided in the law. But the country that we are
concerned with in the bill before us appears
to be entirely different, and it does seemn to
me that section 9 would tend to establish
a precedent against which we should be carefui to guard. I do not .think the railway company has any moral. legal or other right to
ask for this exemption, and, so far as I arn
concernied, I intend to support the amendment
of the senator from Bruce.
Han. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
1 was chairman of the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications which
considered this bill. If I recali rightly, section 9 was voted upon, but the bill's other
provisions and general purport were regarded
as of so much more importance that there
was relatively littie discussion of this section.
I can oniy say to the house that the reasons
which were urged in support of the section
were substantially these. First o! ail, we
were told that the section was, as just stated
by the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), similar to one in the bill passed last
year authorizing construction of the line from
Sherridon to Lynn Lake. It was stated that
the territory from. Terrace to Kitimat is as
barren and uninhabitated as the territory
from Sherridon to Lynn Lake, and that there
was no more likelihood of settiement along
one line than the other. It was also sald
that a very large part of the lime from Terrace
to Kitimat was being constructed through
rocky cuts and along the sides of rocky rivers,
where there was no possibility of settiement
in any event.
I must say that my understanding o! what
we were told in committee about the present
legal position diiffered a littie from that of my
honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien). We were advised that the reason
why this section was desired in the bill was
that the Railway Act requires railway companies to fence their rights of way, and that
unless we granted this exemption the Canadian National would have to provide fencing,
useless and unnecessary though it mlght
be, along this rlght of way, and that the
cost would be--I forget the exact figure-mn
excess of $100,0O00.

SENATE
I am not arguing the case. I am simply
putting to the house the arguments that
were advanced to us in committee.
We were also presented with the argument
which was made a few moments ago by
the senator from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLennan). That is, we were told that if
we approved of this section 9, the railway
company would not be relieved of its liability
at common law for damages in the event
that negligence could be proved against the
company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The company would be
negligent, for other than non-fencing.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, for other than
non-f encing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It would be open to
proof, for instance, that the trains were
travelling at an excessive rate of speed, or that
a proper lookout was not being kept.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes; something of
that kind.

Hon. Mr. Vien: There could scarcely be
any damage result, other than from the
absence of fencing. If an animal goes on to
the right of the way of the railway and is
killed, there is no liability under common
law if the obligation is removed by statute.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know that I
would agree with that statement.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not agree with it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If, for instance, a railway company knew that animals were in
the habit of crossing at a certain point, and
it deliberately drove its trains at an excessive
speed at that point without due caution, I
would think that under the common law the
company would be liable for damages.
The interesting point was brought to our
attention that sometimes the obligation to
fence, as contained in the Railway Act, offers
more protection to the railway company than
to the farmer, for if a farmer sues as a
result of his cattle straying on to the railway and being killed, and the railway company can iprove that the fence was in good
order, there is no liability for damages.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I do not agree with that
statement. I have sued railway companies
in similar circumstances and got damages.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Where the fence was in
good order?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The company could not
prove how the cattle got on the track.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am simply reporting
what we were told in committee. In the light
of the discussion this evening, it might be
well to refer the bill back to the committee
for consideration of section 9.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Strike it out.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think we should have
the Railway Act before us.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I wanted to explain
to the house the reason why, in my judgment, the committee took the stand it did in
adopting section 9 without the profound consideration that perhaps has been given to it
this evening.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am sure the chairman of
the committee (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will
admit that the practice of railway companies
to leave their right of way unfenced over
vast uninhabited spaces is adequate evidence
that fencing is not made compulsory by the
Railway Act. If there were an obligation on
the company to fence under any condition, it
would have to fence in all areas; but, as I
say, there are vast stretches of track which
are not fenced.
When a private citizen desires the erection of a fence along a railway track, he
may make application to the board, and an
order issues compelling the railway to erect
a fence. I have known of cases where railway tracks were not protected for decades,
and all at once a settler made application to
have the railway erect fences, or perhaps
dig ditches, along its right of way. The
Board then sent out an engineer, who reported
back whether such a fence as was asked for
was desirable, or whether ditches should be
dug.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I would not pretend
to have anything like the knowledge of the
workings of the Railway Act that my honourable friend has had by reason of his having been Chairman of the Board of Transport
Commissioners for a number of years. However, we were told in the committee that in
a number of instances the board has exempted
a railway company from the positive requirement to fence in areas where there is no
settlement.

Hon. Mr. Vien: That is quite right.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Regardless of the
statutory obligation and of the order of the
board, it is my understanding that if the
railway company simply takes the chance in
the matter of the absence of fencing, and
damage occurs, the company is liable. Apparently the statutory obligation to fence is there
in any event.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I am not in a position to make a statement
on behalf of the government, but in view of
the discussion tonight I would be agreeable
to a reference back to the committee of the
bill and the proposed amendment.

JUNE 2., 1952
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why flot carry the
amendment, and be done with it?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In fairness, I would
be prepared to adjourn the debate unti I
have some information to give to the house.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Send the bill back to
committee.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
two methods of procedure are open to the
house: first, the honourable senator from
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh) may withdraw
his motion in amendment; or, second, the
house may agree to a motion for the adjournment of the debate.
Han. Mr. Siambaugh: Honourable senators,
I would prefer to have the debate adjourned

until tomorrow. I intend to go West tomorrow night, and I should like to be here
when the matter is further considered. However, there are many honourable senators
who appear to support the position I have
taken.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: To facilitate the matter for my honourable friend, I now move
the adjournment of the debate, and if what
I have to say to the house tomorrow is not
satisfactory, the bill may then be referred
back to the Standing Conimittee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

Sometimes in our eagerness for progress we
are apt to forget those who have served us
faithfully over many years. I noticed in
reading the speeches of last night that little,
if any, reference was made to the steady work
carried on in the Library of Parliament by
Mr. Hardy and his associates. We all remember that only a few years ago our library had
no card index system and there was very
little cataloguing done of our books. But now
this work has been going forward' steadily for
a number of years; and long before Dr. Lamb
was authorized to direct a National Library
organization, we all looked forward to a
National Library and a better-equipped
Library of Parliament. I should not like
it to be thought that we do not show a proper
appreciation of all the work that has been
carried on through the years.

would follow. It is proper for the government to regulate distribution. In one of the
committees this morning we discussed the
sale and distribution of salacious and indecent
literature. There too, I think the federal
government should attempt some form of
regulation. I do not speak only of dairy
products when I say that there should be a
law which would enable the provinces to
protect themselves against things which they
regard as harmful.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I am
not sure that I follow the effect of the
amendment which the report of the committee recommends. The bill itself purports
to amend chapter 39, section 6 of the statutes.

whole bill.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The amendment calls for

Hon. Mr. Hayden: The effect of the amendment is to repeal section 6 of the original

Hon. Mr. Vien: I do not grasp the
implication.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, I do not mind

some day. Section 6 of the original Canada
Dairy Products Act appears on the right-hand

proposed to amend that section by striking
out of it any reference to interprovincial
trade, or to prohibition by the governor in
council, through regulation of the movement
of certain named products between provinces.
The effect of the committee's amendment is
not to amend section 6, but to repeal it; and if
this amendment is adopted, section 6 of the
Canada Dairy Products Act will be eliminated.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I understand it now. Thank
you.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
THIRD READING

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved the
third reading of the bill.
He said: I have a few words to say, not as
to the proposed amendment, to which I offer
no opposition, but to the general circumstances surrounding the consideration of this
measure. Certain statements have been made,
perhaps in the heat of debate, about the government's handling of legislation in general.
I attended the committee meeting at which
the Minister of Agriculture appeared and

made a statement and I need hardly say how
happy I am that a solution agreeable to all
concerned seems to have been reached. If
I recall the minister's remarks correctly, he
said that the Act had not been proclaimed
because it was a re-enactment of many of the
features already existing in the Dairy Industry Act, and that after reading the debate in
the Senate he had some doubt whether he
needed the power which clause 6 purported
to give him. He further stated that he had
in mind the introduction of an amendment
to this very measure, but that pressure of
business had prevented him from doing this,
and he indicated that he would take under
consideration the amendment proposed by the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler). Some action contemplated or which
had actually taken place in the province of
Ontario, caused the minister to feel that under
existing legislation he had sufficient authority
to deal with fraud or misrepresentation; but
he said that if the authority was not there,
he would ask for it in some manner other than
by amendment of the Canada Dairy Products
Act.
During the debate I felt that perhaps there
was some undue criticism of the minister
and myself for allegedly interfering, as members of ýthe government, in trade between the
provinces. The minister said that be had no
such intention, and that he was willing to
consider changing anything that tended to
interfere with such trade. This he did. One
honourable senator said that the Senate
should be firm in its stand on this question;
but there was no intention, as I understand
it, to limit the power of the governrent
in dealing with fraud or misrepresentation.
The underlying principle, I gathered, was
opposition to any measure that would curtail the free movement of goods and services
between the provinces of Canada. Perhaps
none of us here fully realize the extent to
which the practice of curtailment has developed through the years; and while the Senate
has no constitutional authority to institute
remedial measures, it might render a useful
public service by inquiring into and reporting upon the extent to which this practice
is being resorted to, not only by the provinces
themselves but by municipal governments
and professional organizations. One honourable senator referred to the "balkanization"
of the provinces of Canada, which had
assumed alarming proportions.
Honourable senators, I have nothing more
to say about the amendment, except that
I am happy that an agreement which is
satisfactory to all has been arrived at.
During the discussion there has been a
good deal of criticism of the government,
actual or implied, because of the manner in

JUNE 3, 1952

which legislation has come to this house.
Such criticism involves me, as I am the
only representative of the government in this
house. It has been suggested that when the
dairy products measure was before the
house, in what is ordinarily referred to as
"the dying days of ithe session", it did not
receive adequate consideration.
On behalf
of the Senate, and specifically, of honourable members who were then present, I
would say that the facts do not support that
view.
As to the objection that legislation is
brought before us too late in the session, I can
say, from the experience of some seven years,
that this objection has been made in this
house every year since I became government
leader. 'If my recollection serves me, the
same complaint was raised each year during
the leadership of the honourable senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), who preceded
me; and I am sure that it was heard when
the two distinguished senators to my right
were infiuential members of the government,
and as such had something to do with the
legislation which came to this house. No
doubt if anyone had the patience to go
through the records of Hansard he would
find that similar criticisms were voiced in
every single year since confederation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And all were justified.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps all were justified.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: On the other hand,
some honourable senators have taken a different view. I quote from one very distinguished gentleman, the Right Hon. Arthur
Meighen, who, while leader of the opposition,
on June 3, 1939, when this very point was
under discussion, said:
This year, as usual, important measures have
come to us in the last and hurried days of the
session. I do not feel like joining in the universal
chorus against that practice, because I know that
regard!iess of how well a government directs its
program it is inevitable that one or more important
bills should remain for consideration at our final
sittings. But I do not think it is very creditable
to this bouse that but a smattering of honourable
members are present when serious work remains to
be done. I have done everything I could, within
reason and with courtesy, to request honourable
members on our side to stay until the end, but with
only meagre success. I suggest that in order to
cure this situation we should restore the rule which
affects very importantly the indemnity of senators
if they are not present during the last two or
three weeks of a session.

When I read that passage my curiosity was
aroused as to the particular rule to which Mr.
Meighen referred. While it may have no
special bearing on this matter, honourable
senators might be interested to know that on
March 6, 1924, the Senate passed the following
rules:
1. A member of the Senate to be entitled to have
his sessional allowance reckoned on the basis of

the full indemnity must attend a sitting of the
Senate on at least two-thirds of the sitting days Of
the Senate.
2. A deduction at the rate of twenty-five dollars
per day shall be made for every day upon which a
senator does not attend a sitting of the Senate
during the last two weeks of any session of parliament.

Obviously these rules did not meet with any
great measure of approval, at least over a
long period of time, since they were repealed
on January 14, 1926, about two years
afterwards.
Such experience as I have had leads me
to the conclusion that under existing circumstances some legislation must be considered
late in the session, for the simple and obvious
reason that when all legislation has been
dealt with, prorogation is not far away. What
are "the dying days of the session"? Probably the week or two weeks preceding prorogation. But may I point out that in this
matter hindsight is very much better than
foresight. We cannot know in advance the
date of prorogation. I have heard a great
deal of discussion, fortified with reasons
which are entitled to some respect, about
the growing powers of governments. But it
is to be rernarked that in one particular the
power of government is no greater today than
it ever was; I mean, control of the date of
The simple phrase "governprorogation.
ments propose and parliaments dispose" is no
less true today than when it was first uttered.
A government proposes legislation, and
members of parliament take as long as they
see fit to consider it. This right is freely and
frequently exercised in the other place.
Members of this chamber have the same
authority.
Although I have never been charged with
the responsibilities of administering a department, I have often thought that if by some
miracle the government of the day could
have its entire legislative program ready
when parliament was opened, the total length
of the sittings would be materially reduced.
BEt whether parliament ends on June 30th or
May 31st or July 31st, there will always be
some last-minute legislation, for obviously
one has to consider one bill after the other.
Ever since I have been here, the last item,
and one of the most important to come before
us, was the Supply Bill; and on many occasions, particularly the year when I presented
the bill some twenty minutes before parliament prorogued, I was faced with the biting
criticism of my honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that in view of the then
situation there was little time to consider that
piece of legislation; and he was right. But
I suggest, honourable senators, that this
condition will always continue.

SENATE
I know of only two courses which might be
followed to try to improve matters. One is
to consider legislative proposals in advance
of the time when they reach us officially. We
did this in the case of the supply bill, and I
believe that the results were reasonably
satisfactory. When estimates have already
been carefully examined, the passing of the
supply bill may be reduced to a mere formality, although of course it is our right to
resume and prolong discussion. The other
method is to delay prorogation until all
legislation has had what in the opinion of
the membership is sufficient consideration.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the answer.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I know of no other
way of improving the existing situation.
We are rapidly approaching a condition not
dissimilar to that which faced us a year ago.
Very shortly there will be placed on the
order paper in the other house some very
important measures-the degree of importance of each bill to any individual senator
depends, of course, upon his point of viewand at a certain stage parliament will be
notified that "this is all". How quickly these
measures will come before us I do not know;
but when the whole of the sessional program
is before us only one of two things can
happen. One is to adopt generally our present practice with respect to the Supply Bill,
or the procedure we adopted when handling
the Transport Bill last year. If any honourable member feels that the legislative mil]
grinds too slowly and that certain bills do
not come before us soon enough, I would be
only too willing to facilitate the consideration
of the subject matter of legislation in one
of our ýcommittees before the bills themselves
come before the Senate.
I have already put forth my best efforts to
have certain legislation introduced in this
chamber, and the Criminal Code Bill, for
instance, is now being dealt with by one of
our special committees. I had thought that
the Citizenship and Immigration Bill could
be introduced here, but such good progress
has been made in the other bouse that this
bill was introduced there. Within a few
days the Minister of Health and Welfare will
come to the Senate to explain legislation in
connection with the Canada Drugs Act.
No matter what I do there is bound to be
legislation that will not corne before us until
what may euphoniously be referred to as
"the dying hours of the session". No one
knows in advance when prorogation will take
place, but when it does I suppose nobody
leaves this place quicker than I do. As I say,
however, I will do everything to facilitate
the early consideration of legislation in this
house, and I will see to it that honourable

members are given an opportunity to give
proper consideration to all legislation no
matter if it delays the prorogation of parliament. But just here I should like to utter a
word of caution. If a minimum quorum of
this house-fifteen or sixteen membersundertakes to hold up parliament on legislation when it is obvious that some seventy-five
members of the Senate are not sufficiently
interested to be present, we may leave ourselves open to smashing criticism.
I should like to come to another point with
respect to the consideration of legislation in
this house. Last December I entered a certain debate and, after giving the government's view on the subject, asked the bouse
not to concur in an amendnent that was
passed in one of our committees. The leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke
irrimediately after me and questioned the
propriety of my, appealing the decision
reached in corrmittee. Let me remind honourable senators of the position in which I find
myself. I am the lone government representative in this house of 102 members. I have
been given to understand that it is my
responsibility in the Senate to introduce all
government legislation, and to see that it is
explained. I will admit that I have never
felt that this house has had as much information on the second reading of bills as it ought
to have, and I have said so in the past; but
I have had to carry on under the present
system. It is my duty to support government
legislation through thick and thin, even
though my personal views may not be in
agreement with those of the government.
If at any time the government adopts policies that so outrage my conscience that I feel
I can no longer remain a member of it, it
will be a simple matter for me to save my
conscience. As I say, I alone of all honourable senators, am responsible for and have
pledged to support government legislation in
committee and in this house, and I do not
think there is any impropriety on my part
in appealing from a motion passed in committee. In this bouse both His Honour the
Speaker and myself have been appointed by
the government. The deputy leader is not a
government appointee, but was nominated
by myself. He is not bound to support government legislation, and has acted accordingly on several occasions. The Whip is
referred to as the "Government Whip" but
that is a misnomer. He is not appointed by
the governrment but by a Liberal caucus.
The deputy government leader, the Whip or
the Assistant Whip mray oppose government
legislation at any time. That is their right.
On different occasions in the last two or
three years, when some contentious matter
has been before the bouse, various senators

JUNE 3, 1952
have suggested to me that I should stand in
my place and announce that government
Senate members could exercise a "free vote".
I have not done so for obvious reasonsalready there is nothing but a free vote.
I believe that al honourable senators,
whether they supported government legisiation or not, have acted according to their
consciences. But it has been my job to support governnent legisliation, and to ask,
sometimes, that it go to committee with a
minimum of explanation so that my colleagues may assist me later in explaining it.
I am sorry that the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) is not
in his place, because I want to quote from
what he said during a former debate in this
house. I quote:
. . . if it was not stated publicly in this chamber
it was at least estimated that the government
wanted it put through as quickly as possible.

He said further:
. obviously there must have been some false
.
pretences about the urgency of the legislation. and
I for one am, shall I say, somewhat annoyed, after
having been told that story, to find out now that
the bill we were asked to expedite has not been
put into effect.

Let me say that as far as I am concerned
there has been no back door method in dealing with government legislation. If the
government has pleaded some particular
urgency with respect to legislation, I have
said so. I am the medium for expressing the
government's viewpoint, but I have never
attempted in any way to hinder consideration of legislation either in cormnittee or in
this house.
I recal the circumstances when the very
tensely debated Canada Dairy Products Bill
was before us a year ago. After being given
second reading, the bih was referred to
committee, and the committee reported it
favourably to the house at 11 o'clock on the
morning of the day when we adjourned
until the Fall. His Honour the Speaker
asked when the bill should be read the
third time, and honourable members who
were present may recall that someone-I
think it was the senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) drew my attention to the
fact that the senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King), who wished to move an
amendment to the biH, was temporarily
absent. I did not ask that any technical
advantage be taken of his absence. On the
contrary, on my suggestion the motion for
third reading was postponed, and we went
on with other business for the time being.
Then by the time that other business had
been finished the senator from Kootenay
East had come into the chamber and I
moved the third reading of the Dairy Products Bill. My honourable friend did me the

courtesy of thanking me for having the
motion for third reading postponed until
he had arrived.
I have never attempted to ram legislation
through this house in any shape or formit would be a foolish thing to do, anywayand I have not been actuated by any such
desire. Naturally I am desirous-and it is
my responsibility-to have legislation proceeded with as expeditiously as is consistent
with proper consideration. But I have never
asked a senator to do anything other than
what he sees fit. I am not in favour of the
rule proposed by Mr. Meighen. In my opinion the question of whether a senator comes
'to this house or stays away is one for his
own decision. I have never asked anyone
to stay or to go away, except on the day
of prorogation or the day before, if the
Whips or those assisting them at the time
have feared that there would not be a
quorum present to enable parliament to
prorogue. I have then asked those whose
homes are in the immediate vicinity to be
on hand to assure a quorum for prorogation. Some honourable senators do me the
courtesy of notifying me when they are
going to be away; but it is not within my
power to say Yes or No, and even if I had
the power I would not exercise it. They come
and go as suits their convenience. I should
like to see a good representation here in the
dying days of the session, but whether a
senator is or is not present is a matter
for his own judgment. Any rule that would
penalize members for not being present
would work a great injustice to those who
come here from long distances in the early
part of the session, work steadily on committees, and who when the session has been
prolonged a day or two beyond the expected
date of prorogation would find themselves
in an awkward position if unable to make
use of railway reservations which they have
been holding for some time.
I hope I am not delaying the house too
long, but I feel that I should say a word
about the suggestion that the Canada Dairy
Products Bill was hurried through in the
dying days of the first session of 1951. Let
me give you the facts. That bih reached
us and was given first reading on Tuesday,
June 26.
His Honour the Speaker then
asked when the bill should be read the
second time, and, in my absence, the deputy
leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) said, "Next
sitting." However, I did not move the second reading until Thursday, June 28, two
days after the first reading. The attendance
was good at that time. The Journals show
there were 47 senators present, a number
comparing favourably with the average

SENATE

attendance throughout the session. There
was a thorough discussion of the bill-far
more discussion, both as to number of speakers and length of time, than on any other of
the 93 public and private biHs that were
passed in that session.
. The folilowing figures showing the space
occupied by speeches in Hansard indicate
the relative length of time spent in debating
this bill and the three other bills on which
the next longest periods of time were consumed:
Columns in
Hansard
Income Tax Bill .............
33
Indian Bih ..................
42
Wheat Board Bill ............
55
Canada Dairy Products Bill .. 73
The record also shows that 26 senators
participated in the debate on the Dairy Products Bill. These figures certainly do not
support any suggestion that the bill was
hastily considered or rushed through here.
I would also point out that the discussion
on the Dairy Products Bill of the current
session has been longer than that on any
other bill, 21 senators having taken part
in the debate, their remarks running to 48
columns in Hansard.
The debate on the motion for second reading last session extended over two days,
Thursday and Friday, June 28 and 29. The
motion was then passed and the bill referred
to committee, where an official of the Department of Agriculture was present, together
with the Minister of Justice. I regretted the
absence of the Minister of Agriculture, but
it was not the first time that I had had to
handle legislation-and difficult legislationwithout the assistance of the minister most
concerned with it, and I doubt if it will
be the last. The committee had before it the
Hansard report of the brief debate on the bill
in the other house. This included a statement by the minister that if for any reason
the legislation proved to be unacceptable or
unsatisfactory, he would consider an amendment.
On behalf of the Senate generally and of
the very considerable number of members
who were present when the bill was under
discussion last year, I repeat that it was
not dealt with in haste. Honourable senators
debated it in the light of the best information
that they had at the time, and I think it ill
become~ any one who was not then present
to reflect on the time and thought given to it.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
my remarks will be very brief. I am of
course gratified that this bill apparently will

receive third reading. I say that because I
think the passing of the bill will vindicate
a principle with which nearly all senators
are in hearty accord, that of freedom of trade
between the provinces.
Perhaps I should not refer to this, for
I know that one should not look a gift horse
in the mouth, but the committee's amendment
really goes a little further than the bill
which I had the honour to introduce. However, that is as may be, and I am quite satisfied with it.
With much of what has just been said by
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson)-though not with all-I agree. I
strongly endorse his statement, which I
myself have made in the Senate at various
times, that the members of this body should
feel entirely free to deal with matters according to their consciences. If members in
general adopt that advice of the leader, I
think the Senate will be a more valuable
body in the future than it has been in the
past. As I see it, the Senate will only achieve
its highest peak of usefulness if every member, upon appointment to this chamber, forgets whether he or she was formerly a Grit
or Tory and determines in future to deal with
matters according to their merits.
Ordinarily, I suppose that I, being the one
who introduced the bill into the Senate,
should have moved its third reading. However,
I am glad that the motion for third reading
was moved by the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), if that in any way advances the likelihood of adoption of the bill in the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I apologize to the bonourable senatorHon. Mr. Euler: That is not necessary at
all.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is just as well to
have this on the record. It was properly the
right of my honourable friend to move third
reading of the bill, and I made the motion
through oversight. I apologize to him for
having done so.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
like the senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), I agree with some of the remarks of
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), but not with all.
In common with many senators, I have had
the experience of serving in another legislative body. For sixteen years I was in the
Manitoba Legislature, and there, as here, I
never knew a single session when the government did not bring down most of its
important legislation in the last two or three
weeks before prorogation. I quite agree with
the leader that this has been the practice in

JUNE 3, 1952
parliament down through the years, but
that does not by any means justify the
practice.
The length of the ordinary session nowadays presents a serious problem to many
members of both houses, and also serves to
keep young people of exceptional ability
out of public life. Some of the ablest young
men in my province have refused to be
candidates for seats in the House of Commons, saying they could not attend to their
own business and spend six or eight months
of every year at Ottawa. True, we get
reasonable compensation while the session
lasts; but when we are defeated, out we goand our business bas gone.
My whole objection-and it applies to
legislatures as well as to parliament-is that
the government called the session on February
28, and no legislation except that for the
control of the foot and mouth disease was
introduced for many weeks. There was in
fact no real legislation before this house until
the debate in the other place was completed.
In my opinion, there is nothing to prevent
the government from introducing all of its
legislation in the first four weeks of each
session and daring the members to waste the
time of the house in discussion. No young
man or young woman of any ability will
enter public life to come to Ottawa and spend
the first two months of each session listening to talk about the good and the bad points
of the government. That is what is happening in parliament today. Look at what took
place in the by-elections held last year and
this year: nothing was said on the public
platform about the real issues before this
country or anything that happened in the
House of Commons. The real problem that
faced this country last year was the high
cost of living; this year there is the added
problem of high taxation. Make no mistake
about it, the major issues are scarcely ever
mentioned in the other place.
I say to the leader of the government in
this house that it is his responsibility to see
that legislation comes before us early in the
session. As a member of the government, the
honourable leader should urge upon his colleagues the desirability of having legislation
ready for the house on the opening of parliament. In that way the governinent would
challenge the opposition-which really determines the length of the sessions-to deal
more expeditiously with questions when they
came up for consideration. I know from
experience that members of the Legislature of
Manitoba, when legislation is pending, are
urged by their constituents to get on with it.

I have no personal criticism whatsoever to
make of the honourable leader of the government. It bas been my pleasure to sit opposite him for seven years, and I could not ask
for more co-operation, courtesy or understanding on his part. I only hope that if I am
ever sitting in his seat, and he in mine, I
will do as good a job as he bas done over
the past seven years. However, I would
remind honourable senators that elections are
now pending in British Columbia and Saskatchewan; and they are getting ready for
elections in Quebec, Alberta and New Brunswick. About the only province that bas no
political activity is Prince Edward Island.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: They have a good government there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; and the people of
Manitoba may decide they want a good
government too, when the next election
comes along.
I now hear that we will be coming back
to attend a new session of parliament in
the middle of November of this year. But
whether we meet in mid-November or early
in January, I urge the government to have its
legislation ready to be introduced at an early
stage of the session. Here we are, within perhaps a month of prorogation, faced with a bill
dealing with combines, although the government knew weeks ago that it would be presenting such a measure. Also, we are faced
with an important measure dealing with
I have never been in a
re-distribution.
house when a re-distribution of the seats was
taking place, but I am quite sure that if the
proposals do not reasonably meet the demands
of both sides, the discussion wil be a lengthy
one. That is the kind of business that makes
for long sessions.
This house bas been sitting steadily since
May 1, and apart from the divorce committee,
which bas been pushing along, we have met
three days a week for the first two weeks,
and four days a week for the balance of the
time. In my opinion, we have just dawdled.
This does not add to our standing in the
community, nor does it satisfy our responsibility to Canada.
While on a visit yesterday to the city of
London, I was surprised at the complete
ignorance amongst some people as to the
existence of the Senate and what it does.
London, Ontario, is no small town, and I was
astounded to hear leading citizens admit that
nobody had ever told .them why the Senate
was constituted, why it continues to exist
or what it is doing today. They knew that
the C.C.F. party had said that it should be
abolished, and somebody suggested that the
"old mugwumps"-I am using the exact
words-should be replaced by scientists and

SENATE
other professional people. I pointed out that
if we discussed in the house the matters we
now deal with in committee rooms, Canada
would be better served and the public generally would know more of what was happening. I pointed to such outstanding members
of this house as the senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), the senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), and the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). These
men where they are known all have the
reputation of being able men. I pointed to
the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), as one who might
well be considered an able citizenHon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -and nobody apart from
four lawyers in the group had ever heard of
him. I mentioned the senators from Toronto
-they knew one of them.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Had they ever heard
of the Whip?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I spoke of the two lady
senators-they knew there were ladies in the
Senate-and they wanted to know something
about them. I said that when questions arose
affecting the women and children of this
country, the honourable ladies were very
active participants in the debate.
Take the legislation now before us, the
amendment to which was thoroughly discussed in committee. When the Minister of
Agriculture-and he is a very able mancame before us he thought that the issue
involved was one of constitutionality. We
brushed that aside, and told him we were
away past that. That is what makes for time
in the consideration of legislation. But now
we are going to be slowed down by a measure
dealing with combines. It will likely go to a
special committee, but if the session is to
conclude around July 1, how much time will
we have to discuss it?
I urge the government, through the leader
in this house, to start a new era in the conduct of the business of parliament. Things
could be changed, if efforts were directed at
the source of the trouble. Just the other day,
for the first time in 85 years newspaper
reporters were allowed in the Senate committee on Divorce. I had asked why they
were excluded, -and nobody seemed to have
any positive answer, except that they thought
there was some provision to that effect. So
what had been done for 85 years was
changed overnight. I suggest to the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) that
he urge the Cabinet to have its entire program of legislation presented in the first
month of the next session, so that it can tell

parliament, in effect, "That is all the legislation there is, and the sooner we get through
with it the sooner the business of the country
will be wound up."

It is my honest conviction that the Senate
can continue, as it did in years gone by, to
make a contribution to national legislation
that will be second to none. We have not
constantly hovering over us the threat of an
election, within so many weeks or months or
years, which could put us politically out of
business. Anyone who has been an elected
member of a legislature knows the feeling
that the electors are watching him. But the
Senate is free from all that kind of thing, and
can devote its time, as the government leader
has well said, to doing what it conscientiously
believes to be the best for our country. Anyone who reads the debates relating to the
establishment of this house cannot come to
any other conclusion than that the Senate
was intended to give legislation "sober second
thought", based on the life experience of its
membership, and to serve the best interests
of the country irrespective of any political
consideration. I will merely repeat in closing
that the government should be invited to
bring down all its legislation as early as
possible after the opening date, so that it can
receive attention when we have time to
devote to it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I noted the remark of the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
about pressure of business on the Minister of
Agriculture. We all know, of course, that the
great pressure of his business in the past three
weeks has been electioneering in the province
of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There is a great deal in
what the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has said, but I think he has told only
part of the story. I have an idea that if my
honourable friend would accompany the
leader of the government to the other place,
while our leader was giving this good advice
to the government the opposition leader could
very well say to his confrere over there,
"If you fellows would only quit talking, the
government will have to bring down its
legislation."

Hon. Mr. Lambert: This discussion, which
my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) is entitled to close, has wandered
rather far afield from the purpose of the
amendment to the Dairy Products Act.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Everybody is out of
order.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In order to conclude the
discussion on a note related to the legislation
which is under consideration, I should like
to suggest to my friend and worthy colleague

JUNE 3, 1952
the senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) that he could usefully clarify the
point of view he expressed earlier in the
debate in connection with this bill, by submitting a resolution at some future date
when the matter he raised could be further
discussed on its merits. I believe it would
be very helpful to all concerned if the respective interests of the provinces and the
dominion in relation to economic matters
could be correlated to the extent of getting
at least some measure of agreement. Upon
that note I conclude my attempt to bring the
discussion back on the rails and to the
subject-matter of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
as amended was read the third time, and
passed.
CANADIAN FARM LOAN BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. F. W. Gershaw moved the second
reading of Bill 275, an Act to amend the
Canadian Farm Loan Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Canadian
Farm Loan Board, is a wholly governmentowned -corporation. It was organized in
1929 to provide long-term loans to farmers
on the security of farm lands. There have
been a few amendments of the Act. For
instance, in 1934 provision was made for
the granting of short-term loans on second
mortgages to those who were already first
mortgagors. In 1950 it was arranged that this
corporation, like any other farm organization,
could be sued; but it never has been.
The question arises, what is the necessity
for such legislation? As I recall, when the Act
was passed there was a great demand for
farm loans. In order to start farming or
to set up an economic unit of farming it
was necessary for many young farmers and
others to borrow money. The banks would
not make advances on land; and loan companies, because of legislation in certain of
the provinces, withdrew from the field altogether. So the government stepped in with
what has been a very useful piece of legislation, because it occupies a field not otherwise occupied, and regulates interest on farm
loans.
The next question is, what is the Farm
Loan Board? It consists of five members.
There is a Commissioner, or Chairman, who is
an executive officer of the board and a fulltime employee; there is a deputy Commissioner or deputy Chairman, who also is a
full-time employee; and there are three
other members, one of whom must be the
Deputy Minister of Finance. As amended,
the Act will provide for the appointment of
55708-25

the deputy minister or any other officer of the
department as a member of the board, and
for an alternate to act in his place when
necessary.
In all the provinces except Newfoundland
there are provincial boards under special
managers.
These managers are full-time
officials and old employees, many of them
having held their positions since the legislation was initiated. Newfoundlanders who
desire loans have to deal with the board at
Halifax.
Separate accounts are kept for
each province, so that it can be seen where
profits are being made and where the board
is going into the red, as it has done in two of
the eastern provinces.
The next question is, where does the
board get its money? It began with a capital
of $5 million, all of which was derived from
the consolidated revenue-that is, from the
government. Since then it has issued bonds,
purchased, by the government, to the extent
of $20 million, and it is permitted to increase
its issues to $50 million. There is also some
capital stock issued at a dollar a share, and
the amount of this stock is to approximate
5 per cent of the total outstanding loans.
Section 2 of the bill provides that the
board may now raise money for lending by
issuing notes. This will be advantageous,
because farmers will be able to pay back the
money and the board will have to cancel
bonds which may run for some ten years.
Section 3 simply gives the government
the right to ask for repayment from profits
of some of the initial capital, but there is
an arrangement that no greater amount will
be paid back to the government than the
amount in the reserve fund which has been
set up. Arrangements are made for the
board to issue and retire capital, and it is
looking forward to expanding in the future.
These arrangements, of course, can only be
made when this part of the bill is proclaimed.
Section 4 of the bill is to correct drafting
regulations. Recently when a member of
the board died it was impossible for anyone
to issue bonds, because there was no
authorized person to sign them.
Section 5 of the bill authorizes the minister
to lend money to the board.
Section 6 is the important section. At
the present time, loans can be made only
up to an amount of $5,000 and 50 per cent
of the appraised value of the land. This
section provides that loans may be made
up to $10,000 and up to 60 per cent of the
appraised value of the land.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the equity in
the land?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: It is referred to as
the appraised value. At the present time
the board charges its farmer borrowers 5
per cent per annum on first mortgage loans,
and 5j per cent per annum on second mortgage loans. The board has the right to
set interest rates, and these must be set at
figures which will give it enough money
to pay its interest to the government, and to
pay its own expenses and set aside a reasonable amount for a reserve fund. Up to the
present time the board has paid all its own
expenses and during the last year of operation the profit amounted to $136,000.
I inquired carefully to find out what the
losses of the Canadian Farm Loan Board
have been. I was informed that since the
inception of the board the losses on properties
acquired have amounted to $428,000, and the
losses written off by agreement to $63,000.
The losses written off under the Farmers
Creditors Arrangement Act-a statute which
has caused some controversy, because it has
drastically reduced some loans-have amounted to $225,000. In other words, since the
inception of the Canadian Farm Loan Board
in 1929 its losses have amounted to
$718,110.03. The Board has been in the practice of setting aside a certain percentage of
its profits each year as a reserve against
possible losses, and thus a substantial fund
of $1,744,000 has been created. The actual
losses have amounted to less than half this
total.
Section 7 of the bill provides for the setting up of a Canadian Farm Loan Advisory
Board consisting of from five to ten members, who, I believe, are to function on a
part-time basis.
Section 8 of the bill provides that the
accounts and financial transactions of the
board shall be audited by the Auditor General rather than by a firm of chartered
accountants.
Section 9 of the bill deals with the application forms for loans, farm loan bonds, mortgages, and so on.
Section 10 is important because it provides that persons who have a first mortgage on their land can never acquire more
than one-third of that amount on second
mortgage, whereas at the present time they
can secure up to one-half. Subsection (b)
of section 10 provides that money borrowed
may be used to purchase new land. This
may seem unreasonable, but in the carrying out of the Act it has been found extremely
difficult to prevent loans from being used
for this purpose. In other words, if a man
wishes to buy new land he will borrow the
money from somebody, and when he gets

money from the Canadian Farm Loan Board
he will pay off this debt. So the government frankly face the issue by saying that
loans may be used to purchase new land.
Section 11, which is important, deals with
those who have first and second mortgages.
At the present time the aggregate maximum
loans which can be secured by first and
second mortgages is $6,000. This amount
has been increased to $12,000. In provinces
where chattel mortgages can be used as
collateral, a loan previously could be made
up te 66 2/3 per cent of the value of the land
and buildings. This has now been raised to
70 per cent. In provinces where no chattel
mortgages are allowed, loans can be made
up to 65 per cent of the value, whereas
formerly it was 60 per cent. It will be noted
that the amounts that can be loaned have
been increased. This has been found necessary because of the increased demand for
agricultural products in the world and because of the present high cost of farm land
and machinery.
Honourable senators, in order to summarize may I conclude with the following remarks? The amending bill which is now
before us has three main purposes in view.
The first is to increase the dollar value of
maximum loans, and to permit loans to be
made on a more generous scale in relation
to the value of the security, and to permit
second mortgage loans to be used to buy
land. The proposed amendment will increase
the maximum first mortgage loans from
At the present time a
$5,000 to $10,000.
first mortgage loan is limited to 50 per cent
of the appraised value of the security, and
it is proposed to raise this limit to 60 per
cent. The present maximum aggregate of
first and second mortgage loans is $6,000, and
it is proposed to increase this to $12,000.
The second amendment which the bill
seeks to accomplish is the establishment of
a National Advisory Board of from five to
ten members to counsel and advise the Farm
Loan Board on lending policies and farm
financing matters in general.
The third proposed amendment is a more
or less technical change in the board's borrowing powers and auditing arrangements,
to bring these in line with the Financial
Administration Act as applying to Crown
corporations. For one thing, it is proposed
that either the Deputy Minister or any
other officer of the Department of Finance
may be appointed a member of the board
and may be represented at meetings by an

books must be done by the Auditor General
under the provisions of the Fiancial Administration Act.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
before I mnake a few remarks I should like
to ask a question or two. Can the honourable senator tell me the amount of losses
incurred in each of the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: There were no losses
in those three provinces. I have not the
exact figures, but I know that only two
provinces were in the red.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What provinces were
those?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am glad there have
been no losses in Saskatchewan. I think one
reason for this is that the board has not
been very liberal with its loans in that
province. Can the honourable senator tell
me how much money has been lent in
Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: No, I have not that
information.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is very difficult to
get one of these loans in Saskatchewan.
'I have had many clients who unsuccessfully
applied for a loan on a section of land
entirely free of encumbrance.
Because
these people owed money on other land the
board would not lend on the security of land
that was perfectly clear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: You should get a
better class of -clients
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The board requires the
farmer to make a financial statement of all
his assets and liabilities, and will not grant
a loan on a parcel of land to which the
farmer has a clear title, unless the amount
of the loan that is realized after the costs
are paid is sufficient to satisfy all his debts.
The farmer is required to list among his
liabilities every debt on farm property in
his name, and any mortgage on chattels as
well. In the past the board refused every
application for a loan if it seemed probable
that some of the money that was sought to
be borrowed would be used for the purchase
of any other property. Even though you
had a clear title to a good property you
could not get a loan on it unless you disclosed to the board just what you proposed
to do with every dollar of the money that
you wished to borrow. As a result, it has
been almost impossible for the ordinary
55708-25J

farmer to obtain a loan. In fact, not a
single application that bas corne to my
attention has been granted.
That is my criticism of what has been going
on in the past. The senator from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) gave a very clear
explanation of the bill, and in general I
agree with its termas. I think it will tend
to open things up a little bit and allow some
of the loans which have been refused in the
past to go through.
There are some other questions which I
wish to ask, but I shall withhold them until
the bill is in committee, where I hope it will
be possible to obtain answers to them and
aise to the questions that I have already put.
Hon. John T. Haig: I hope the senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon Mr. Gershaw) will procure
some information for me also. I wish to
know the total amount of the loans -made
annually for the hast five years in each of
the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta. I suggest to him that he will be
shocked at the smallness of those loans. The
provincial government is building a highway
east of Winnipeg and values the land in the
district at $60 an acre. You could not buy
any land there for less than $75 an acre, yet
the Farm Loan Board places a value of only
$30 upon it. So far as my province is concerned, the present Act is absolutely useless.
The only people who borrow under it are
the very ones that the government should
not lend to. Evidently the same thing is
true in other provinces. Let me give an
illustration. In the province of Saskatchewan
-I do not know whether I should say this
or notHon. Mr. Roebuck: Be careful.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, you had better be
very careful.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I held a mortgage on a piece
of land for thirty years. Every year I hoped
the farmer would pay me something on
account, but at the end of the thirty years
he owed as much as at the start.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What interest did you
charge him?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Four per cent, and I
thought I was stealing money from him,
at that. I knew the land was poor. Well,
one day he wrote me and said he was
applying to the Farm Loan Board for a
loan. I do not think any one should pray that
the board will grant a loan, but never in
my life was I so close to doing that as
then. Anyway, the loan was made and I
have been paid off in full.

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the

READING TOMORROW

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
despite the rule requiring two days' notice
of a motion for second reading, with which
I thoroughly agree, I should like to ask permission of the house to have the motion for
second reading of this bill placed on the
Order Paper for tomorrow. And if possible,
consistent with careful examination of the
bill, I should be glad to have the bill passed
again this week.
The bill will be distributed as soon as possible, when honourable senators will note that
it is a fairly simple one. Existing legislation
does not permit the government to make
traffic regulations on government property
where there is a right of way. This bill
remedies that weakness by empowering the
government to make regulations in any event.
It also makes clear that the owner rather
than the occupant of a parked vehicle is
liable for any infraction of the law, a provision, I understand, that is customary in all
traffic regulations.

I have consulted the chairman of the
Standing Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds (Hon. Mr. Fafard) and the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), who also
is a member of that committee and, like
the chairman, has spent a good deal of time
and energy in trying to reach a solution of
the vexed problem of parking on government
property. If the house is agreeable, I will
move that the bill be placed on the Order
Paper for second reading tomorrow.

I have asked my colleague the Minister of

next Tuesday, if that will be agreeable to
honourable members, to explain this bill
on the motion for second reading. While of
course it is always the desire of the government to have legisiation expedited as much
as is reasonably possible, this bill, which is
a very important one, is being introduced
here with the idea that it may be circulated
and that persons interested in it shall have
an opportunity of appearing before a Senate
committee. Should the Senate in its wisdom
see fit to, pass the bill this session, that of
course will be quite satisfactory but the
question of how much time shall be spent

deduction allowed, no matter how many
dependents a person may have, has been increased from $1,000 ta $2,000. Tha:t applies
ta 1952 and subsequent years.
Section 8 of the bill amends section 27 of
the Act. You will recali that subsection 1 of
section 27 provides that dividends received by
one Canadian corporation, or a corporation
resident in Canada, from another corporation,
may be deducted from taxable incarne; and
there is a list of the classes 0f companies
whose dividends may be deducted from the
taxable incarne of the receiving corporation.
The first part of this amendment extends the
list by adding thereto foreign business corporations, that is, Canadian corporations
which carry on their business entirely outside
of Canada.
It is when we came ta subsection (2) of
section 8 of the bill that we run into problems.
That subsection repeals subsection (lA) of
section 27 of the Act, which is under the
heading of "Dividends from controlled corporations".
A controlled corporation is
defined as one the contrai o! which has been
acquired on or after May 10, 1950, which date
was fixed by an ameodment made ta the Act
in 1950. Where a controlled company which
was acquired after that date had a surplus
at the time the contrai was acquired, that
surplus is called in the Act a designated surplus. There are several ways by which you
may now get the surplus out. You may, for
instance, get it out under the provisions of
section 95A, by paying a tax o! 15 per cent.
You are required ta make an election, but if
you do not do so the provisions of section
27(3) (lE) will apply.
The present subsection (lE) is repealed, and
a new subsection is substituted in a further
attempt at phrasing. In previaus years the

-attempt ta put the formula into exact words
presented a problema that does not seemn ta,
have been satisfactarily settled, and it is f elt
that a better job is done now. 1 would not
attempt a detailed explanation of how the
subsection works. It cames into play only
where a controlled company has a designated
surplus and attempts ta pass a dividend without makîng an election. The problemn then
is ta determine whether the dividend includes
only current earnings made since the control
was acquired, or something from the
designated surplus. If I read the new subsection there would be difficulty in following
it, so ta try ta make it clear I have had a
typical case worked out, making certain
assumptions, following the formula, and
spelling out the attempt ta determine what
amount of a dividend paid in those circumstances would be regarded as having came
fromn the designated surplus rather than from

JUNE 4, 1952
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Next I wish to deal with
subsection 4 of section 8 of the bill, which
is to be found at the bottom of page 6. This
repeals subsection (3) of section 27 of the
Act and substitutes a new subsection therefor. This gives relief. The present section
27(3) of the Act puts up what might be
called a road block against a certain type
of transaction. Let us say that an individual
or corporation was holding securities against
the possibility of making a capital gain on
them. In the meantime the last thing in the
world that the person or corporation desired
was income, so around the time when a
dividend was about to be declared-and in
some cases it might be a substantial dividend
-the owner would sell those securities to a
trading company. The dividend would then
be paid to the trading company, in whose
hands it would not be taxable; and subsequently the trading company would sell the
shares back to the person from whom it
originally bought them, this transaction being
made at a loss which would reflect the payment of the dividend. Prior to the introduction of section 27(3) in its original form the
trading company was in a position to charge
off the loss against its trading operations, but
that section provided a complete bar to this
deduction. The new subsection (3) abates the
rigour of that provision by allowing the trading company in such circumstances to deduct
the loss on the securities if it has held them
for a year, provided that at the time the
dividend was paid the trading company did
not own more than 5 per cent of the particular
issue of shares involved in the transaction.
But although the new subsection gives a
measure of relief, the road block still stands
against any of the more substantial operations which were indulged in from time to
time before the passing of the original
subsection.
Section 9 of the bill, on page 7, sets out
the new table of graduated rates of tax
applicable to individual incomes for 1953 and
subsequent years. This table implements the
budget resolution. The defence surtax is
consolidated in these rates.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The defence tax is
hidden.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I used the word "consolidated".
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You cannot see it, but
you can feel it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As a matter of fact,
these new graduated rates apply to part of
the year 1952 as well. If you look at subsection 4, on page 8 of the bill, you will see
there the rates which are to apply in 1952. In
part of the year we will have the old graduated rates, plus the defence surtax, and for the
55708-264

balance we will have the new rates which give
some reduction in the amount of surtax. The
subsection to which I refer really covers the
effective rate applicable in 1952, and thereafter subsection 1 of section 9 provides the
general rates which will remain in force
unless and until they are changed.
Subsection 4 of section 31 of the Act is
repealed, and a new subsection, containing
a definition of "investment income"-and it is
not important at the moment-is substituted
therefor.
Subsection (7A) of section 31 of the Act
is repealed. The effect of this is to remove
the application of defence surtax from investment income. It appears that there was some
confusion about whether or not the defence
surtax was to apply to investment income.
This removes the doubt.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is the interpretation
now?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is not an interpretation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In what way does it remove
the doubt?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: By repealing the subsection.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then does the tax apply to
investment income or does it not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The defence surtax, when
repealed by subsection 3 of section 9 of the
bill, will no longer apply to investment
income.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Because it is incorporated in
the general rates?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The investment rate is
a special rate; it is not incorporated in the
general rates.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The 4 per cent rate?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, the 4 per cent rate
which applies on income above a fixed level
and allows for certain deductions. There
was some doubt as to whether the defence
surtax, in the form in which the legislation
was enacted, applied to investment income.
Now the doubt is entirely removed by repealing the subsection which introduced the
defence surtax.
I now turn to section 10, on page 9 of the
bill, by which section 34B of the Act is
repealed. That was the section which enabled
a person who was subject to the recapture
provisions in relation to depreciation, and
Who had taken depreciation for a number of
years on the diminishing balance basis and
then sold his property at a gain, to take that
gain into income at the rate of one-fifth each
year for five years, instead of taking it all
into income in the year in which he made it.

SENATE
Subsection 3 of section 13 is a clarification,
to make it clear that defence surtax is not
intended to apply to non-resident-owned conpanies.
Section 14 provides for the tax credits to
which a company 'in Canada is entitled in
relation to its earnings in various other
countries. The section would clarify two
points. First, it makes it clear that you are
not entitled to deduct the amount of tax
paid in foreign countries in relation to income
received from operation in Canada; but you
are entitled to deduct the amount of tax
paid on that income to the extent that the
amount received from foreign sources was
subject to tax in Canada. Further, the bill
makes it clear that foreign tax credits are
not lumped together. Each country is taken
separately, and the income that has accrued
to the company in Canada, from its operations
in a particular country, is related to the
income tax laws of Canada, to see to what
extent it is subject to tax in this country.
If it is not subject to tax in Canada, the
taxpayer is not allowed a tax credit.
The next section I want to deal with is
No. 15. I regard it as of some importance,
because it modifies the original concept of
the law as regards recapture where property
is subsequently sold and a capital gain realized. The effect of section 15, which provides for new section 39A, is to entitle both
an individual and a corporation to spread the
period of recapture over five years. A few
practical problems have to be dealt with.
This method of depreciation was introduced
in 1949, and the five-year period would
expire in 1954. It is now proposed to bring
the five-year provision into effect for 1954
and later years. Subsection (3) takes care
of excess capital cost allowances in the

Although that section is now to be repealed,
you do not need to worry too much about it,
for you will find that by section 15 of the bill
the five-year benefit is restored, not only
in relation to individuals but corporations.
Section 11 is merely a clarifying section,
and I do not think I need spend any time on it.
Section 12 has to do with rates for related
corporations. I need make no comment on that
section, except to say that with respect to
related companies the rate is 50 per cent, and
that subsection 3 of this section provides
for an apportionment of the rates in cases
where the fiscal year of the company fals into
two calendar years.
Section 13 provides for a credit of 5 per
cent against the federal tax. Against the rate
of 50 per cent corporations are entitled to
a 5 per cent credit in relation to the provincial tax in those provinces which could
be described as the non-agreeing provinces,
namely Ontario and Quebec. The purpose of
this provision is to give a credit on income
earned in the province, whether or not it
is taxable under provincial law. The section
also provides for the enactment of rules for
determining the portion of income which
shall be in that category. It is altogether
likely that the rules presently existing in
the provinces will be adopted, but we shall
have to wait and see.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Do I understand that a
firm with its head office in Ontario, and
doing 90 per cent of its business in the
other nine provinces, would not enjoy the
credit of 5 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. What this means
is that a firm which is now doing business
in Ontario and paying 7 per cent provincial
corporation tax is entitled, as against the
federal corporation tax of 50 per cent, to a
credit of 5 per cent of the income it has
earned on its operations in that province.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Does that provision
also apply in Quebec?

JUNE 4, 1952
the year 1953, the carry-back of the amount
to be written back to income would be onefourth in each of the years 1949 to 1952.
The section, therefore, is a relieving one,
indicating a more expansive attitude on the
part of those who formulate income tax
policy. To use a well known expression, I
would say to the author "More power to
your elbow"-and I hope there will be a continuous movement in the same direction.
I have already dealt with section 16, so I
need say no more about it.
Section 17 deals with trusts, and adds a
subsection (4A) to section 58 of the Act. It
provides that income received by a trust in
the form of interest and dividends from a
non-resident-owned investment corporation
can be retained and accumulated by the
trust without the beneficiary incurring liability for income tax.
Section 18 deals with service pay and deductions. Last spring, in dealing with income
tax law amendments, I occupied possibly
a page and a half of Hansard with an explanation of a method or a code for dealing with
service pay and deductions. It has been
found that the procedure, particularly as to
the dollar-per-day credit whi'ch the soldier
in foreign service is walking around with,
presents al kinds of difficulties. Therefore
section 18 repeals the provisions enacted last
year, and enunciates certain principles and,
gives power to the Governor in Council
ta provide by regulation for the computation
of the tax, and sa forth. Broadly speaking,
the principle is this. If the soldier has no
other income than his pay, he shall at the
time of his enlistment furnish the paymaster with a statement showing what dependants be has, if any, and his statutory
deductions; then, in the computation of rates,
allowances will be made on the basis of a
standard of donations, medical expenses, and
the rest; his rate of deduction will be set;
income tax will be deducted from each pay
cheque before he receives it, and be will not
have to file a return. If his annual income
from other sources is in excess of $50 a
return will be required. The principles ta
be applied divide this system into two compartments:
one, the
old compartment,
relating to his service pay; the other, ta his
outside income, and with respect to the latter
he will make a special return if such income
exceeds $50. But the break he gets is that,
for the purpose of computing the tax, outside income would be reckoned as though it
were the only income he has, and would not
reflect his service earnings.
Section 19 has to do with the personal
corporation, which may be defined as a corporation controlled by one person, and whose

source of incorne is financial. If a corporation is conducting an active business or
manufacturing operations, it can always be
removed from the personal classification. The
abject of this section is te make it clear that
a personal corporation does not cease to be
such because a man may turn his hobby, say
farming operations, into a personal corporation in the hope of changing its category for
tax purposes.
Section 20 is designed merely ta make it
clear that non-resident-owned investment
corporations do not get the benefit of the 5
per cent deduction for taxes paid in the
two "non-agreeing" provinces.
Section 21 clarifies the definition of a
foreign business corporation, and there is
nothing that I need develop in this respect.
Section 22 of the bill amends section 69 of
the Act, which allows an employer, in cornputing income for the tax-year, ta deduct
special payments made on account of an
employees' superannuation or pension fund in
respect of past services. Notwithstanding the
fact that a pension fund has been set up, the
only way in which an employer can now
provide additional money by way of pastservice-benefits, and have the right te deduct
it for income tax purposes, is ta show that
the fund is not actuarially sound. The new
subsection (2) of section 22 of the bill authorizes an employer te deduct special payments
made ta a superannuation or pension fund if
he feels that the benefits provided under the
present plan should be increased because of
present-day conditions.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: If an individual or firm has
no superannuation plan, would any retiring
allowance paid ta a former employee be
deductible?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Our income tax laws provide that there must be an approved pension
plan. Sometimes when employees have
grown too old ta render further useful service,
their companies continue ta pay them on the
basis that this "extra remuneration" should
have been applied during the period of their
active employment; in other words as though
these employees had not been paid sufficiently
during the period of their active employment.
I am just mentioning this fact by way of
explanation, but I do not know whether the
income tax authorities would be satisfied with
that kind of thing.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: If a superannuation fund
has been approved, could the individual or
company add a further retiring allowance
without obtaining additional approval?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is what section 22
covers. It broadens the basis upon which you
can make a further contribution that can

SENATE
be deducted, providing you have contributed
a lump sum payment to take care of past
services up to the date of the commencement
of your plan.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I want to have these questions on record so that the minister and his
departmental experts may see them.
If this privilege applies to a firm which
has a superannuation scheme and is permitted
without further approval to make an additional contribution, why would it not apply
to an individual or firm not operating with
a pension plan?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You are asking me a
question on policy. All I can do is state the
position as I see it. The income tax laws
provide that in order to deduct contributions
to a pension plan, the pension plan must be
approved. According to section 69 of the Act,
an employer who has made a special payment
or payments to a superannuation fund in
respect of the past services of employees may,
in computing the income for the taxation
year, deduct the lesser of-and the section
reads:
(a)One-tenth of the whole amount so recommended to be paid, or
(b)the amount by which the aggregate of the
amounts so paid during a period not exceeding 10
years ending with the end of the taxation year
exceeds the aggregate of the amounts that were
deductible under this section in respect thereof in
computing the income of the taxpayer for the
previous years.

As I said before, the only way an employer
can add further money by way of pastservice-benefits and deduct it for income tax
purposes is to show that the pension plan is
not actuarially sound. This section has been
drawn up with the realization that living and
social conditions have changed, and that what
was thought to be adequate ten or fifteen
years ago may not be adequate now. An
employer is authorized to make an additional
lump sum contribution, and to deduct it for
income tax purposes. I can think of some
obvious difficulties that would arise if this
privilege were to be extended to somebody
who has no pension plan. In the first place
it would be much more difficult to supervise
and control a plan that is not approved and
in the hands of the income tax officials in
Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: By an approved plan
does the honourable member mean a plan
approved by the department?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, exactly.
Section 23 of the bill deals with section
73A of the Act, which is one of those so-called

complicated sections. It deals with undistributed income on hand. The new sub-paragraph (iva) provides that certain corporations
shall be allowed to deduct amounts taxed
under section 97, subsection (3), in computing
undistributed income on hand. This becomes
important in the winding-up of a company;
and if you want to take advantage of
section 95(a) of the Income Tax Act, it
becomes important to know what is the
amount of income which can be earned to
the end of December 31, 1949. The bill provides also for a number of additions to correct situations that may occur. For instance,
subsection (8) of section 23 deals with personal corporations. The earnings of a personal corporation in the year are taxable in
relation to the percentage of interest of the
various shareholders, whether or not a dividend is paid out. But you may have a
personal corporation that is not always a
personal corporation, so you have a complication there. In arriving at undistributed
income under section 73A of the present Act,
the actual dividends paid are deductible.
Dividends paid by a personal corporation are
not. Dividends actually paid by a personal
corporation are not deductible, because the
earnings which support them have been taxed
in the year in which they were earned. That
is one of the handicaps, if you want to
call it that, which you face when you choose
to operate a personal corporation. The effect
of the amendments in section 23 is to say that
a personal corporation, in making its calculation under section 73(a) of the Act, should not
deduct anything in excess of the actual dividends paid by it. A personal corporation
may have several sources of dividends; it
may have dividends from a capital surplus
as well as from earnings. I do not think I
would add anything of value by going back
over the explanation that was given of
section 73A when the original Act was before
us, and tracing down all the deductions, for
the amendment simply adds another item to
the list in the section and qualifies that list.
Section 24 of the bill continues the exemption of mining companies from income tax
for their first three years of production. The
exemption, which is now applicable to mines
coming into production up to the end of
1954, is extended to mines coming into production during the year 1955. It will be noted
that sylvite mines are included among the
mines entitled to exemption during this
running-in period. I understand that sylvite
is a form of potash, and though in some
quarters it may be regarded as coming from

JUNE 4, 1952
bedded deposits, incarne derived from its production wfll be entitled to the same exemption
that now applies ta the incarne of metalliferaus and industrial minerai mines. In order
ta qualify for the exemption, an industrial
minerai mine must be certified as such by the
Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys.

Section 30 makes clear that a discharge
of a mortgage over the name of an officer
authorized by the Minister of National
Revenue is a good and sufficient discharge.
The need for the amendment arose in this
way.
Occasionally the department has
accepted a mortgage from a person unable to
make payment of a tax in money, and after
the tax was paid the discharge of the mortgage was signed by a departmental official.
A number of earnest solicitors in various
provinces have questioned the validity of a
discharge executed in this way, and the
amendment removes any doubt that there may
have been in the matter.
Section 31, subsection (1), defines "exempt
income" and "farming". Subsection (2) of
this section defines "blood relationship". One
has only to read the subsection to get the
import of it.
Section 32 of the bill is purely technical,
and has to do with its interpretation. The
amendment substitutes the words "a person"
for the words "one person".
Section 33 provides that persons engaged
in exploring and drilling operations may be
allowed for expenses incurred in the 1955
operations on the same basis as for expenses
incurred in the years 1951 to 1954.
Section 34 has to do with the operations
of mining companies, and spells out their
rights in relation to exploration and development. The section makes applicable to mining operations the same regulations which
now apply to oil operations. This means that
expenses incurred in connection with exploration and development can be carried forward
to a year when there is an income against
which those expenses can be set off.
In the main, honourable senators, I have
covered the various sections of the bill, and
while I have not attempted to give a completely exhaustive explanation, I think that
under the circumstances it has perhaps been
full enough.
Before I sit down I should like to throw
out two thoughts which are not necessarily
for immediate consideration, but can be
brought up at some future date. We should
be thinking about them, and perhaps the
minister should know about them. The first
is the recurring situation wherein a taxpayer
who has made his return is reassessed on the
ground that all his sources of income were
not disclosed, that he wrongly interpreted
some provisions of the law, or for some other
reason which in the view of the department
indicated that he had not paid enough tax.
Upon reassessment the taxpayer resists the
increase and is successful in having restored
the amount declared in his original tax return.
In such a case there is a strange anomaly, in

that the expenses which the taxpayer incurs
in proving his original income return to be a
proper one are not allowed by the department as legitimate expenses deductible from
income for taxation purposes. In such a case
the Crown has challenged the propriety of
an income tax return by an individual or
corporation, and it seems to me anomalous
that he should not be allowed to deduct the
costs of defending his position.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is that not a taxable item
under the Exchequer Court Act?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What I am saying is that
for income tax purposes it is not allowed as
a deductible item.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Are you submitting an amendment?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No; I am merely calling
the attention of the house to it.
The second point which I wish to raise
-at this time is the increasing prevalenceat least in my professional experience, and
I am sure in that of others as well-of goods
being passed for customs or excise purposes,
and then a year or two later, after they
have been processed and sold, the department deciding for some reason or other that
perhaps the value of the goods was understated or that the value established for duty
purposes was lower than the value of similar goods sold for home consumption, and
that there should be a revision, of the customs or excise duty charged.
It often
happens that when an assessment is made
in that manner and an additional ýamount
is levied, it is too late to claim the increased
duty as a deductible item from income tax
for the current year.
The department
simply shuts the door, as it were, to a claim
that the total customs duty is an expense.
I think the Senate should give some consideration to bringing about co-ordination
between the various taxing authorities,
whether they have to do with customs, excise, sales tax or income tax, so that the
taxpayer will be in a position to claim
credits to which he is entitled by way of
business expense. I am assuming, of course,
that the low customs assessment was not
due to fraud or misrepresentation on the
taxpayer's part. If it were, and he was
faced with a supplementary customs levy, I
would of course say to him: "You have made
your bed; now whether or not it is uncomfortable, you must lie in it." There are,
however, many instances in which no such
misrepresentation or fraud is alleged, but
in which, by reason of the lack of co-ordination between the various taxing statutes, the
taxpayer is unable to claim his total operating expenses for income tax purposes. There

JUNE 4, 1952
should be some means by which he could
recover what he had lost in that manner.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I ask the house to permit me to interrupt proceedings to announce that we have in our
gallery today two very distinguished visitors, in the persons of His Excellency Doctor
J. R. M. van den Brink, Minister of Economic
Affairs for Holland, and Madame van den
Brink.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: They are visiting Canada at the invitation of the Canadian Government, and recently they opened the Canadian
Trade Fair in Toronto. His Excellency enjoys
the added distinction of having been an influential member of the Senate of the Netherlands, to which he was elevated at the
relatively early age of thirty. Having left
that body-which I suppose, like our own
Senate, is no longer interested in political
affairs!-for a political atmosphere, he may
be a trifle disappointed at having been compelled, since he arrived in this country, to
share his popularity with another, for His
Excellency and Madame Vandenbrink have
with them their three-year-old son, who,
wherever they have gone, has "captured the
show". However, they must bow before filial
competition.
I hope they will take back to their homeland our very best wishes, together with a
realization of our keen appreciation of them
and their very great country, and of our
pleasure and happiness to have residing with
us in ever-increasing numbers so many of
their excellent citizens.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not intend to make
a speech on the matter before the house. I
am not in the same class as the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Hayden) who has just
explained the bill. As usual, he did a fine job.
I knew he would, and I was so sure of it
that on Monday, while in London, I promised
several people that I would, send them copies
of this legislation and of the speech of the
honourable senator. I told them that I would
do so with reluctance, because I was sure that
the citizens of London who read the bill and
the explanation would have such a clear
knowledge of the law that the legal profession would lose a lot of business.
In the last four or five years, under the
aegis of some person responsible for income
tax administration, the departmental reports
following taxpayers' returns have been
expedited to the degree that, if a return is
presented in April this year, there will be
received early next year, or before, a report

from the department showing its determination of the assessment and generally what
bas been done about it.
I could make my point clear from personal
experience. Some years ago, if an owner
of land, instead of cropping it, put it in summerfallow, the government allowed him so
much per acre for the summerfallow. Well,
I owned land, and somebody bought it from
me and summerfallowed it, and became
entitled to $20. A departmental official
searched the land titles office, and having
discovered that the title was in my name, sent
me the money. I asked my accountant
"What is this for?" and, she searched the
records and said, "You haven't that land".
I said "Who owns it?" She said she did not
know, but the department had stated the land
was in my name, and that was all they knew
about it. We put the money into a special
account, and some three years afterwards the
department, having checked my returns, communicated with me and stated that I had not
reported the receipt of $20. I said "I did
not get it". The official answered, "Oh yes,
you did, on a certain date"; and the cheque
was produced. Three years having gone by,
I could not remember anything about it, nor
could my accountant; and there we were. I
said I would not pay. They said "We will
re-assess you". I said "Go to it, and you
will hear about it in the Senate of Canadaand often". That might be called a threat;
all the same, I used it. About four years
afterwards, when they had got around to
checking a farmer's account, they found that
he had made a return showing the $20. He
was asked "Where did you get it?" He said
"I don't believe I ever got it, but I should
have got it; I earned it". When he was asked
with whom he had dealt, he said "I dealt with
Mr. Haig". They told him he had better
go to see me, so he walked in and said "You
remember that land I bought from you many
years ago?" When I said I did be asked, "Did
you get $20 about four years ago?" and I said,
"So you are the fellow who has caused me
all this trouble! I should charge you about a
hundred dollars in legal fees for having to
defend myself against an iniquitous charge
by the government". In any event, I gave
him the $20, and presumably the government
heard of it. But my point is that had my
return been checked within a year there
would have been no difficulty in tracing that
amount. The department's official in Winnipeg is doing a good job and getting out
assessments promptly, and this means very
much to the public.
In this connection I think the Senate,-I
except myself-deserve to be complimented.
Some years ago we held an inquiry into
income tax law and presented a number of

384

SENATE

recommendations. At first the government
refused even to consider them, but two years
or so later they were adopted by the government, and among them was that most important provision for a right of appeal to a board.
Nothing with which I have been connected
while in Ottawa has given the province of
Manitoba so much satisfaction as that plece
of legislation. I congratulate the government for having adopted our recommendation,
and I compliment the board on the way their
work has been done.
I believe it is the intention to send this
bill to committee. I have one suggestion to
make, and while the request may be troublesome to the government leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), I shall try to frighten him into
accepting it. I believe that when this bill is
considered in committee there should be a
stenographic report. Lawyers, accountants
and other interested people could get a written
record of the questions asked by senators and
the answers given by the departmental officials, and the material thus made available
would be of great value in establishing a
uniform system all over Canada. Printed
and published, the proceedings could be circulated to superintendents of income tax in
all provinces, and would provide them with
a verbatim and authoritative statement of the
law. I believe we did something of this kind

about five or six years ago, and I remember
that the department's representatives in
Winnipeg thanked the Senate, through me, for
having furnished them with a record which
put beyond question the meaning of the
various sections.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In reply to the specific
question of my honourable friend I can only
say that the matter is one for the committee
to decide. My personal attitude is much the
same as that of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who in
replying to a request for financial assistance
in a certain locality, referred to what he
called the "well-known generosity" of his
Minister of Finance, and said, "In the words
of Scripture, 'Ask and ye shall receive' ".
I can add nothing to the explanation of the
bill itself. Recently in a more or less general
or abstract discussion of the handling of
legislation in this house, and alluding to some
inadequacies of explanation, I was careful to
draw a distinction between my own explanations and those of others who assist me.

SENATE
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY
TRAFFIC BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill D-11, an Act for the
control of traffic on government property.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that a question was recently asked by the
honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), and that some discussion was initiated by the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
in connection with the activities of the
Standing Committee on Public Buildings
and Grounds in relation to the rather vexed
question of the regulation and control of
vehicle parking on Parliament Hill. As was
indicated at that time, some difficulty had
been experienced in enforcing existing legislation, with the result that effective control
and regulation of parking has ceased to
exist.
Yesterday I presented a bill designed to
deal with this problem. The explanation of
the measure is as follows:
Provision for the regulation of traffe on
government property is now covered by
chapter 47 of the Statutes of 1930, which
authorizes the Governor in Council to make
regulations,
-for controlling or prohibiting the operation of
certain vehicles in or upon any of the parks, roads,
avenues and driveways which are situate on the
property of His Majesty, and over which there
exists no public right of way.

It will be noted that the power to make
regulations is restricted to property "over
which there exists no public right of way."
This limitation has caused serious difficulty.
For the example, if the roadways on Parliament Hill constitute a public right of way,
there is no power under the statute to make
regulations governing traffic upon them. On
the other hand, if they do not constitute a
public right of way, regulations can be
made.
Whether or not those roadways
constitute a public right of way, is a difficult
and complicated legal question, and one
which could arise in any prosecution under
the Act for an infraction of the regulations.
There seems to be no reason why the
power to make regulations should be restricted in this way. Therefore, the bill
would remove this limitation and empower
the Governor in Council to make regulations
for the control of traffic upon any lands
belonging to Her Majesty in -the right of
Canada.
Normally, in order to prove ownership of
land, legal agents would have to be employed to make a search, and title deeds or
other documents would have to be tendered

in evidence.
This procedure is far too
cumbersome and expensive for ordinary
summary prosecutions. A clause is therefore inserted to provide that the production
of a certificate signed by the Minister of
Public Works, or certain other persons, shall
be accepted as prima facie proof of ownership
of the property described therein.
Another clause provides that the owner of
the vehicle shall be liable for infractions of
the regulations by other persons who are
parking or operating the vehicle with the
owner's permission. This provision is necessary to ensure enforcement of traffic regulations, and in particular those relating to
parking, for it might be difficult, if not impossible, to prove who actually parked the
vehicle. A provision such as this is common
in traffic acts or traffic regulations.
Finally, the power to make regulations has
been clarified, and maximum limits have been
placed on the penalties that may be prescribed
under the regulations.
The present Act
merely authorizes the imposition of penalties;
but under this bill a maximum penalty of $50
or imprisonment for two months is prescribed.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
have the honour to be a member of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
which when it met under the chairmanship
of the honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Fafard) about three weeks
ago, had an urgent problem to consider. Legal
advisers were called in from the Department
of Justice, and they told us that the regulations under the existing law are difficult if not
impossible to enforce. For example, last fall
a young man parked his car in one of the
spaces reserved to the Senate. The police
ticketed the car and brought him before the
police court, and the magistrate held that no
offence had been proved. I was deputed by
the committee to see the Minister of Public
Works, as these matters fall within his jurisdiction. He received me very courteously
and stated that he had already asked for an
opinion on the question of law involved. A
few days ago, having received that opinion,
he wrote me to the effect that he had been
advised to institute legislation, and that he
was doing so.
The issue is simple. Unless some of the
land now under grass is used, there is barely
enough room to accommodate even a limited
number of senators, members of the House of
Commons, departmental officials and members
of the press gallery; and even with the strictest
supervision and regulation, not enough space
is available for all of them. The police, I
think quite properly, have said that they
cannot enforce the present law. The Sergeantat-Arms is worried half to death. I agree
with the remarks of the senator from Leeds

JUNE 5, 1952
(Hon. Mr. Hardy) and the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid): the
situation is an unfortunate one.
It was originaily intended that the parking
site on the roadway fronting the buildings,
near Wellington street, should be available
for the cars of tourists visiting the Parliamnent
Buildings. I do flot know the views of other
honourable senators, but I strongly favour
amenities of this kind. It is ail to the good
that visitors shall have a convenient place
to leave their cars while they are inspecting
our buildings. To digress for a moment, I
recal an incident two years ago when a
family of Texans-a father and mother and
two grown boys-visited our Parliament
Buildings. It happened to be Civic Holiday,
and as I was in the building-we senators
who corne frorn far away usually are around
on holidays-I had the great pheasure of showing these people around. Since then we have
carried on a correspondence, and I feel that
as a result of that incident I have made friends
for Canada, and I know that they have won
a friend for the United States.
The question bas arisen whether the grassed
areas at the back and front of the main
building should be used for parking purposes.
I personally do not think they should.
UJnless legisiation of thîs kindi is passed,
ail will be chaos. I have seen people who
are not even employed on Parhiament Hill
park their cars on these grounds. The other
day I saw a man who works downtown
park bis car on the Hill at about balf-past
eight in the morning. It was long after I
had had rny 'breakfast so I was around to see.
Every time I went out of the building during -the day 1 saw that car parked in the same
spot, and at five thirty in the evening 1
bappened to see the driver get into bis car
and drive away. I know that there was
neyer any intention that this sort of thing
should go on.
I arn wholebeartely bebind this legisiation, and I congratulate the Minister of Public
Works for baving had it d.rafted. If it does
not work, we can arnend it in the future. I
think it is entirely in the interests of parliament that legishation to regulate the u.se of
parking space around this and other government buildings should be passed.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Wbile I agree tbat it is
necessary to bave a certain arnount of control of these things, we must rememnber that
all taxpayers in Canada sbouhd be equahhy
entithed -to park their cars ýaround public
buildings. They ahl share in keeping up this
buge federal area. Personally, I think the
broad cement wahk heading u.p to and away
from. the main building could be utilized for
parking; two rows o! cars could easily be

parked along its sides. While I do not tbink
that the green lawns in front of the main
building should be used for parking, I do
think the grassed area behind the Senate
Chamber could be used, and it would accommodate at least one hundred cars.
To my mind, it would be bad if the general publie could say that we were sirnply
trying to keep thern fromn parking their cars
on the "Hill". I do not feel that any person
visitînýg a senator for an hour or so should be
prohibited from parking his car sornewhere
on the grounds. We should proceed carefuily in this matter and give further thought
to, provid.ing add!itional parking space. Practically every person owns a motor car today,
so it seems to me that a great deal more
space sbould be put to use for parking cars
around our government buildings.
The motion was agreed to, and the bull was
read a second time.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: If that is the wish of

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
INCOME TAX BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resurned from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Hayden for the second reading of Bill 205, an
Act to amend the Income Tax Act.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I want to join witb the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in extending congratulations to the bonourable gentleman frorn
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) on the splendid
presentation he made of this bill yesterday
on the motion for second reading. I arn quite
sure that those who have tried to, familiarize
themnselves with this legishation w-111 agree that
in many sections the wording is a decided
improvement over that of the present Act,
and wiil welcome this measure as a step in
the right direction.
I moved the adjournment of this debate for
the purpose of making a plea for the survival
of the principle of private enterprise. I ara

SENATE
appealing on behalf of telephone companies,
which have been excluded from the benefits
allowed to other public utility companies
under section 75. I think everyone will agree
that the telephone is a necessity today, both
in commercial and in social circles; in fact,
in our present civilization it would be very
difficult for the nation to get along without
the telephone.
In Canada we have telephone companies
which are privately owned and those which
are operated by governments. The former
pay taxes; the latter do not. While the
privately-owned companies are quite willing
to bear their fair share of the tax burden, I
do not think they should be used merely as
tax gatherers for the government. The 20
per cent surtax imposed last year created
great difficulties for all privately-owned
public utility corporations. The rates which
these companies are allowed to charge are
regulated by public utility commissions, and
no company can change its rates without the
sanction of the commission under whose
regulations it operates.
Honourable senators will recall that last
year we asked the minister to make an
exception in favour of public utility companies whose charges were regulated, by
allowing them to earn a fair rate on the
capital employed before this 20 per cent surtax was imposed. We pointed out that in
the United States there was a provision which
recognized this principle, and that telephone,
telegraph and air-line companies are allowed
to earn 7 per cent on equity capital, retained
earnings and borrowed funds, before the
excess profits tax applies. We asked our
government to do something in the way of
giving similar lenient treatment to public
utility companies in Canada. The minister
advised that while he was sympathetic and
appreciated our difficulty, his officials had
been unable to devise any formula which was
workable. He promised further consideration
this year.
Honourable senators will note that this
principle is recognized in section 75 of the
bill, but to our dismay the leniency only
applies to public utility companies distributing electrical energy, gas and steam. Telephone companies are not included.
It is on this point that I am making my
protest, because I am wondering why telephone companies should be discriminated
against and not placed in the same category
as electric, gas and steam distributing companies. In the Maritime Provinces, Quebec
Ontario and British Columbia the telephone
industry is operated by private enterprise. The
story of the New Brunswick Telephone Company can pretty well be duplicated by the
companies in these other provinces.

In our little province of New Brunswick the
present New Brunswick Telephone Company
was built, organized and developed by the
vision, pioneering spirit, hard work and courage of our forefathers. If we had not had
individual enterprise in those days when the
company was being developed, we would
not have in Canada today, honourable senators, the things of which we are so free to
boast. Those people invested their moneyin some instances, their entire savings-in
this telephone enterprise in New Brunswick,
and throughout the years New Brunswick has
been provided with telephone service and the
investors have received a modest return on
their investment. At the present time the
company has 6,037 shareholders, and to show
how widely the stockholdings are distributed
over the province, I need only point out that
24.7 per cent-almost 25 per cent-of our
shareholders hold between one and twentyfive shares, and only 3 per cent hold more
than five hundred shares.
In 1948 this company was obliged to apply
to the Public Utilities Commission of New
Brunswick for the right to increase its toll
and exchange service rates; and the right was
granted, the increase becoming effective on
November 1, 1949. This increase in rates
was based on the cost of materials and on the
wages and taxes then prevailing. We
expected-in fact we assured the commission
and our patrons-that no further increase
would be necessary for a considerable period,
even though it was apparent that we would
have to expand our plant greatly in the
immediate future. However, the imposition of
the 20 per cent surcharge in last year's taxes
has upset our entire calculations, because
with that impost our total dominion and provincial income taxes, including the additional
2 per cent tax under the Old Age Security
Act, now amount to 52-6 per cent of our
earnings.
Just to show how taxes have increased in
this particular industry I would like to point
out that in 1947, five years ago, the tax per
telephone in use in the province of New
Brunswick was $5.84, while in 1951 it was
$12.23. That is, out of every rental paid by
telephone patrons in New Brunswick, $12.23
went for taxes. This adds up to these figures:
The New Brunswick Telephone Company paid
in taxes last year $957,000, of which $730,000
came into the federal treasury. That is the
amount which the telephone users of New
Brunswick contributed to the federal treasury. Telephone users of Nova Scotia, Prince
Edward Island, Ontario, Quebec and British
Columbia have contributed on a similar basis,
and I am expecting that senators from those
provinces will support the stand I am taking
here. The voice of my honourable friend

JUNE 5, 1952
fromn Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor),
for instance, is always heard on behalf of
minarities and the downtrodden, and I amn
trusting in him ta look after the interests of
Nova Scatia, as I arn trying ta look after
those af New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Cari you give me the
figures for Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Burchiil: Na, I arn sorry I have not
those, but I can get them.
Han. Mr. Raebuck: I should like ta have the
breakdown as between the independent telephone companies and the Bell Telephone Company.
Hon. Mr. Burchiil: Honoura-ble senatars wil
of course realize that the telephone company,
like every other business, must pay a competitive rate for the rnoney whîch it is using in
its capital expansion. We cannot expect ta
induce people ta invest their money in the
telephone îndustry unless they are assured of
a fair interest return. Consequently, shareholders must be paid a dividend which is
sufficiently attractive as compared with the
return from other opportunities for investment.
0f course, at present, when we are obliged
ta pay more than one hall of our earninigs
ta the government in the way of taxes, it is
impossible ta earn a sufficient dividend on
aur capital, and we are faced with the necessity of making another application ta the
Public Utilities Board of New Brunswick for
a further increase in rates. In this connectian
I want ta point out ta honourable senators
that in making the application it is not sufficient .to ask for what would seemn ta 'be
enough ta meet aur requirements: we are
obliged ta, ask for double the arnount, because
more than one hall the increase-52 per cent
-would have ta be immediately turned over
ta the federal government in taxes. That is
a striking display of the spiral of inflation.
What I have told you about aur experience
in New Brunswick holds true for Nova Scotia,
Prince Edward, Island, and every other province in Canada whose telephone business is
being conducted by private enterprise.
It is interesting ta note that in its submission on taxation matters ta the Ministers
of Finance and National Revenue, the Canadian Chaxnber of Commerce made the following reference ta this matter:
In sat year's Budget address It was proposed
that certain types of companies would be
allowed a measure of relief from the defence surcharge, ini that the defence surcharge would not
operate so as to reduce the net Income of a company after federal tax but before any provincial
income taxes to a point below a 5 per cent return
on capital employed.
This proposed relief was wlthdrawn, as it appears
that a definition of capital employed satisfactory

to the Minister of Finance could flot be estabished.
It is realized that there may be some difficulty ini
establishing a formula that would be equitable in
ail situations, but it is beieved that consideration
might be given to those companies whose revenues
are regulated or by nature of their business cannot
be expanded, in order that these types of companies may flot be hampered in their capacity to
earn their normal profits affer tax.

Honourable senators, I hope that I have
made my point clear. I appreciate very much
indeed the action of the minister in giving
special treatment to public utility companies
distrihuting electrical energy, gas or steamn
-in other words, for recognizing the validity
of the principle that we submitted to hirn
last year-but, 1 submit, telephane companies are entitled to the same treatment.
Hon. D. MacLennan: Honourable senators,
the last speaker expressed curiosity as ta
why telephone companies were not included
within. the provisions of section 75 of this
bill. So f ar as Nova Scotia is concerned, I
can give him the answer right; away. In that
province ail that it is necessary for the telephone cornpany ta do in order ta obtain an
increase in revenue is apply ta the provincial
Utilities Board. That board has neyer been
known ta turn down an application for an
increase in rates, notwithstanding the fact
that in one smail town that I know of there
were on a single line fourteen subscribers,
ail payig a monthly service charge of $2
each.
If the Utilities Board in New Brunswick
is of similar calibre ta that of the board in
Nova Scotia, 1 amn not fearful that the telephone company in New Brunswick will suifer
greatly because of not deriving any benefits
under this bill. I have certain reasons for
believing that I know why every application
macde ta the 'Utilities Board is granted, but
I do flot need ta state those reasons. Lif e is
toa short for that. To attempt anythîng like
that would possibly make bad friends for
me and not bring about any worth-while
result. It seemns to me that if the New Brunswick Telepbone Company decides ta apply ta
the Public Utilities Board of that province
my honourable friend from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burch-ili) need not have any
apprehension.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honaurable senators, at
the outset I had no intention of saying anything on this bull, but my good friend from
Northumberland, (Hon. Mr. Burchill) has
spoken so well and so convincingly that I amn
indined ta range myself on his side, at least
for the moment.
My honourable friend, as he put it, bas
made a plea that nathing be done which
would prejudice the survival of private industry as against publicly owned corporations.

SENATE
For a good many years, when I was younger
than I am now, I supported rather strongly
the system of public ownership, and to some
extent, though not as strongly as I once did,
I still do. I believe that great public utilities
which lend themselves to the development of
monopolies and that sort of thing, should at
least be under government control, if not
government owned. But notwithstanding my
belief in that principle, it is my view that a
utility which is owned by a municipality or
a province, or even by the federal government, should stand on its own feet and pay
taxes in the same way as do privately-owned
corporations.
What appealed to me most
particularly in the remarks of my friend from
Northumberland, was the discrimination
which he alleged, and which I assume he
represented correctly. I can see no possible
reason why a privately-owned telephone
company in New Brunswick should be taxed,
when a similarly-owned electric light company, or gas company, escapes taxation. It
seems to me that when this bill goes to committee, as I suppose it will, a point such as
this should be very carefully considered.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, is it
the intention of the Senate to send this bill
to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
were the bill before us to carry into effect the
conditions which my honourable friend from
Northumberland has so eloquently and forcefully placed before the house, I would, have
to refrain from voting one way or the other.
I have acted for the independent telephone
companies of Ontario, and may now be
regarded, I think, as their counsel, and as
such, I may be said to be personally interested in the question, in a remote way. But
as the subject is merely up for discussion, I
feel free to have my little say.
There are in Ontario approximately 400
independent telephone companies, and of
course there is the great Bell Telephone
system as well. As a result of legislation
passed some years ago by the federal government, the Bell system was required to
provide connections with all the independent
companies, so that in a sense the telephone
system of Ontario-and of other provincesis one great unit. A person, by making use
of the Bell Telephone lines can telephone
from the smallest hamlet on one side of the
province to the smallest place on the other
side without being conscious that he is being
served by a number of independent
companies.
Although, as a result of the legislation I
have mentioned, the system has become one
great telephone exchange, the smaller com-

panies, nevertheless, perform a function that
otherwise could not be carried on by a large
corporation. These companies are composed
usually of merchants and farmers living in
and near a town who join together in order to
create for themselves a telephone service.
They supply their own capital, and although
small in figures, it is most important to them.
Such independent groups have for some reason been overlooked in legislation and as of
today a very small percentage of such companies have ever paid dividends to their
stockholders.
I was in consultation only yesterday with a
group of local people who have invested their
funds in providing themselves with a telephone service. They do not even have an
exchange; their lines are connected with the
Bell exchange, which connects one party line
to another and furnishes long-distance service.
In fact, the only profits in connection with
this operation are the long-distance tolls. My
information is that for some ten or twenty
years the stockholders of this small company
have not drawn a dollar of dividends; but they
have been under obligation to improve the
system, with very little hope of accomplishing that end. Today they are short of capital,
and the quality of the service is suffering;
at the same time, there is little or no prospect
of securing more capital, and they are faced
with a most difficult situation.
This problem applies almost generally
throughout the three or four hundred small
independent telephone companies operating in
Ontario. I regret that I did not know yesterday that this subject would be discussed today.
Had I known, I would have attempted to
provide myself with more statistics on the
problem and I would have had a better idea
of how much the telephone systems should be
required to pay. But certainly, in any move
to abolish discrimination against these companies, little or big-and that includes the
Bell, because it is performing a great service
-I would most heartily concur.
I congratulate the honourable senator from
Northumberland on his clear thought and
forceful presentation of this subject to the
house.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
while listening to the remarks by the honourable senator from Northumberland (Hon.
Mr. Burchill) and his very pertinent question,
which requires an answer, it occurred to me
that perhaps the debate should be adjourned

JUNE 5. 1952
ta permit the securing of an answer. But as
I intend to move this bill to committee, it
aIso occurs ta me that my honourable friend
and some other senators would like to have
before them in cammittee the responsibie
officiais from the Department of Finance, ta
whom questions couid be put and from whom
any relevant information could be obtained.
I shail draw ta the attention of my coileague
the Minister of Finance the very pertinent
point which bas been raised, and ask that the
committee, when it meets, shail have the
opportunity of discussing it with his officiais.
I therefore move that this bill be referred
ta the Standing Committee on Bankîng and
Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
AERONAUTICS BILL
SECOND READInG

Hon. A. K<. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 194, an Act ta amend the
Aeranautics Act.
He said: Hanourable senators, this bill is ta
provide for the zoning of airparts. It contains provisions which. empawer the Gavernar
in Cauncil ta make comprehensive regulatians for the zaninýg of lands surrounding airparts, for restricting the use of such lands,
and for regulating and iimiting the heights
of buildings, other structures, and trees in the
vicinity of airports.
I do not know that I need emphasize the
grawing importance of air travel, bath civil
and military, ta the economy of titis country.
Canada, because of its geographical position,
stands ta benefit more than aimost any other
country from the deveiopment of quick and
ecanarnicai air travel. Neither do I need ta
emphasize the importance of safety in air
travel, bath for aviators and passengers and
for the inhabitants of areas surraunding the
airports from which passengers leave and at
which they arrive.
This country bas an extremely good safety
record in the matter of air trave,-a record
which I think is second ta none. On the
other hand, we are aware, from. reports we
have seen in the newspapers in the past few
months, that some tragic accidents have
occurred in the great and friendiy country
ta the south o! us, particulariy in buiit-up
areas close ta and in the neighbourhoad of
airports.
I would ask my honourable friends, in
considering this bill, ta think for a moment of
the physical aspects of the average airport.
It is quite a large area, containing of course
the han-gars and other airport buildings, the
roads leading ta these structures, and at least
twa and sametimes mare runways from which
planes take off and on which they land, the

particular runway used on any partidular
day being dependent upon the direction o!
the wind.
As honourabie senators knaw, airpianes
take off and land very gradualiy, and they
fly 10w over the surrounding land. Therefore
it is essential that there shouid not be in this
area any structures--buidings, power uines,
or anything of that kind-which. would interfere with those aperations. Indeed, one of
the mast essential fMatures a! every airport
is, not the actual physicai extent of the airpart itseif, but its relationship ta the
immediate surroundings, the area which is
caiied the "aerial appraach". This approach
must be free from danger and ciear of
obstruction.
As I have said, the extent of this aeriai
approach ta the actuai land which must be
protected in this way is very much larger
than the area of the airport itseif. On the
other hand it is ta be considered that the
placing of an airpart ini a location which is
usuaiiy close to same large city bas, a! itseif
and because of the manifoaid activities in
which the airport engages, the effect o!
increasing the numýber of buildings in the
immediate vicinity, 'bath for residentiai purposes and, in many cases, for industrial uses.
Therefore, for those twa, reasons-the need
ta have the aeriai approaches ciear and the
fact that buildings in the immediate neighbaurhood of airports are likeiy ta be constructed very soan after the airport is constituted-the necessity 0f building regulations
wil be appreciated. During the war zoning
regulatians were introduced under the War
Measures Act, but they are no longer in effect.
Legisiation for the zaning of airparts is in
farce today or is about ta be enacted in
neariy ail civiiized countries. It bas been in
operation for a number of years in Great
Britain, and for a very long period in the
United States, aithough, awing ta the constitutional system. of that country, the authority resides in the individual states rather
than with the federai governmnent. Nevertheiess, I arn given ta understand that over the
past f ew years there bas been a gaad deal
of progress in making uniform the State laws
in connection with the zaning of areas surraunding airports.
Perhaps at t-his point 1 shouid say a word
as ta the constitutional position in Canada
as it relates ta the iegislation now before us.
Honourable senators who are members of the
iegai profession wili recall a judgment of the

Hon. Mr. Emmerson: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Is that distance of 7
feet or 50 feet for every 1 foot of height in
the same plane as the runway?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: That is important, because otherwise if the land sloped away from
the runway the height of the building -could
exceed the restrictions mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. 0f course there
wil be particular regulations for each zoning
area. If one can envisage an airport built
on top of a hill, for example, one wrnl see
that high buildings could be constructed all
around, provided they did not go above a
certain height in relation to the fiightway.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On the other hand,' if
there were risinig land at the end of the
flightway, the building might be a minus
quantity?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Quite so. These matters
are technical, and I arn going to suggest that
when the bill is given second reading it be
referred to a committee. In that connection,
perhaps I should state that yesterday I had
the pleasure of an interview with Mr. Baldwin, Chairman of the Air Transport Board,
who told me that his organization had prepared a three-dimensional plan of the Dorval
Airport showing visually exactly how these
zoning restrictions ýwould work out with
respect 'to that airport. If the bull is sent to
committee that plan will be available for
inspection by honourable members.
The second part of the bilHon. Mr. Roebuck: Before the honourable
gentleman begins to deal with the second part
of the bill, may I ask a question? Perhaps
the information thaît I wls*h to have has
already been given, and been overlooked by
me. What provision is there, if any, for
compensating property holders in the immediate vicinity cf airports or even in remote
districts? ,ýPropert;y owners always benefit
from any advantages resulting from proximity
to-a government project, and if they shifer any
disadvantage through that proximity they
want to.be paid for it.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The second part of the
bill, to which 1 was just coming, contains
provisions for compensating property holders
who are injuriously affected by these zoning
regulations. These provisions are in 'the new
subsections (8) and (9), on page 2 cf the bull.
I arn advised that these subsections have been
inserted after a great deal of consideration
by the various government departrnents concerned, for 1 arn told that as a general rule
compensation is not given ini other countries
for damages caused 'by zoning regulations.
Certainly in the United States no compensation is allowed for such damnage as may be
sustained through the enforcernent of zoning
regulations. Therefore, in rnaking these provisions we are to some extent breaking new
ground.
Honourable senators will see from subsection (8) that compensation is allowed to an
owner to the extent to which his property
is decreased in value by the enactment of
the zoning regulations, but he has to offset
against that decrease in value any increase
that occurs by reason of 'the location of the
airport nearby.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is, any increase
that occurred in the value of the property
after he becarne the owner of it?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: After he became the
owner of it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then I suppose if you
have a dlaim against an airport for depreciation of your property, the thing to do is to
seli the property to somebody else, and then
he can start ab initio.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: This principle of
deducting from compensation the arnount by
which the value of the property has been
increased is already contained in our
statutes. Section 50 of the Exchequer Court
Act reads:
The Court shail, ini determining the compensation
to be madle ta any person for land taken for or
mnjuriousiy affected by the construction of any
public work, take into account and consideration.
by way of set-off, any advantage or benefit, special
or generai, accrued or likely to accrue, by the
construction and operation of such public work, to
such person in respect of any lands held by him
with the lands so taken or injuriously affected.

That provision will apply to any dlaim for
compensation for lands injuriously affected
by zoning.
The only other point to which I should
direct the attention of the house is that subsection (9) fixes a time limit within which
a person may make a dlaim against the governiment for damages under subsection (8).
When the bill was first introduced in the
other house this time lirnit was set at one
year, but an amendment changed it to two
years, and it is in , that form that the .bill

SENATE
comes before us. In other words, the owner
of property injuriously affected by a zoning
regulation must launch his claim within two
years after the regulation comes into effect.
I do not think there is anything else that
I need say at this stage. If the bill is given
second reading, I will move that it be
referred for further consideration to the
Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Will my honourable friend
permit a question? Is it intended that the
regulations shall go so far as to cover the
removal of existing buildings?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No. I am advised that
there are very few, if any, existing structures which need to be taken down or
removed, and if there are any they will be
dealt with under the Expropriation Act or by
negotiated sale.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Is this legislation
intended to apply to all classes of airports?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The intention is to
have it applicable ultimately to all classes of
airports, but for the time being only the
principal ones will be affected. I am told
there are more than 1,200 airports in the
country.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I mean, does it apply
to military as well as civil airports?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
the measure which has been so well explained
by the senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) will appeal to most members of
this house as being a necessary one. In
Canada we are still not far beyond the first
stages of the development of air services.
Legislation of this kind which is designed
to protect the public by guarding against
accidents is important, and should be placed
on our law books as early as possible.
Although we shall have an opportunity to
consider the bill in detail in committee, I
rise at this time to suggest to our colleague
who explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
that in addition to securing a map showing
the effect of the proposed legislation on the
airport at Dorval, he should also secure
information from some source as to its effect
on the Stevenson airport in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: And the Rockcliffe airport at Ottawa too.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In the light of the
explanation, it occurs to me that the government might run into substantial claims
for compensation in connection with the
Stevenson airport.
That airport, unlike
many, which are not near large cities, was
built close to the city.
There is now

a fully established
community on the
southerly side of it, as my honourable colleague from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) well
knows, and to the east of the airport there is
a housing development as well as factories
and other establishments under construction.
It would be useful, I think, to know what
effect the proposed regulations as outlined by
the honourable senator from Inkerman would
have on an airport of that type.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I do not intend to detain the house
more than a moment.
When the honourable senator was explaining the bill, particularly that part which
dealt with the prohibition of the construction
of buildings within a radius of 13,000 feet of
an airport, I had in my mind's eye a picture
of the airport in Rockcliffe, close to which
some of us live. I cannot possibly see the
plan outlined by my friend being applied for
the protection of that area, which is now
invaded every other hour of the day and
night by jet planes and other high-powered
aircraft, very much to the discomfort of
everyone living in that part of the capital.
True, the village of Rockcliffe is on a hill and
the airport is down in a hollow, but small
aircraft as well as four-engined planes have
power enough to clear the trees in that ýarea.
Yet everyone who has lived in Rockcliffe and
has watched the development of air operation
there has been increasingly aware of impending trouble and danger. Time and again leading citizens in the village have brought this
problem to the attention of the authorities.
I am pleased to see that there is now some
recognition of the necessity of zoning of areas
around airports. But when we talk about
compensation for taking over of properties
within two and a half miles of an airportsuch as Rockcliffe, which is perhaps one of
the most valuable residential districts in this
country-we must realize that it would cost
a pretty penny to carry out the proposed
regulations. For my part, I would be quite
willing to offer my place at a bargain price
any time. Of course I cannot speak for my
friends the senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson) and the honourable leader of this
house (Hon. Mr. Robertson); but neither of
them lives as close to the airport as I do.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
this seems to be necessary legislation, and I
welcome it; but I am a little troubled about
the provision for compensation.
It is not very many years since the Malton
airport was established in the vicinity of
Toronto. At that time the area was farm
land, and the price paid was the usual price
for farm land adjacent to a big city. The
airport was established, and there has grown

JUNE 5-, 1952
up around it quite a community. My impression is that that land, wbich was once sold
by the acre at a moderate price, is today
selling on the basis of 25-foot or 50-foot
lots at prices which would be counted in
the bundreds of dollars, if not in the tbousands. I have in my mind two lots situated
side by side in the neighbourhood of the
airport I have mentioned. These lots have
increased in value from, say, a few dollars
to many hundreds of dollars, ail by reason
of the location of the airport. If the zonîng
regulations are enforced there would be,
as I understand it, a depreciation in value;
but that would be offset by the appreciation
in value due to the location of the aîrport.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is, since the
owner acquired it?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With this furtber provision: that if there bas been a change in
ownership the appreciation is lost sigbt of. We
are left with tbis picture: the first lot, let
us say, was owned by one person fromý the
start, and the second lot was purcbased just
prior to the passing of the regulation. That
would mean that the owner of the flrst lot
probably would not benefit to any great
extent by reason of the fact that the appreciation would just be about as great as the
depreciation; but in the case of the purchaser of the second lot, wbo migbt have
got the property at a "wash sale," the appreciation will be lost sight of and be will
get good dollars by way of compensation for
the depreciation.
Wby sbould the appreciation be lost sigbt
of in the one instance and not in the other?
It does not seem to add up; it does not seem
logical or f air to the public. I tbink the
value wbicb the air enterprise bas attributed
to the land sbould remain, irrespective of
wbo the owner may be, and regardless of
wbetber the property bas cbanged bands,
even at a "wasb sale", in order to show a
right to collect depreciation. The two cases
do not seem to be on all fours.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Of course, I tbink my
honourable friend's concern is related to a
case wbicb is in effect a fraudulent sale.
Hon. Mr. ]Roebuck: It might be fraudulent,
or it might not be.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Let him consider these
two cases. In the first case the owner is a
farmner; an airport is constructed in the
vicinity, and bis farmlands go up quickly
in value. Zoning regulations are establisbed,
and the farmner dlaims that bis land bas
depreciated in value. The answer to him
under this legishation would be that bis land
bad appreciated in value mucb more than
it had depreciated. In the second case, an

industrialist, for instance, has bought from
that fariner a portion of his farma after the
airport was established but before the zoning
regulations came into force, and bas done so
at an enhanced price, with the intention of
building a factory; and he is the man who
would really suifer from the depreciation if,
as a resuit of tbe introduction of zoning
regulations, be could not use the land for
which he had paid this enhanced price.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: His dlaim. would be
against the original owner.
Han. Mr. Hugessen: No: he has merely sold
the land at X dollars.
Hlon. Mr. Roebuck: He might be in the
position illustrated by the case of the two
men, one of whomn bought bricks and the
other straw. The straw burnt, the bricks did
flot. Each had bought bis commodity subject
to all its inherent risks, whatever they might
be. The man who bought bricks did not lose;
the man who bought straw, did; but nobody
else would be expected to step in and coinpensate the man who bought the straw. The
man who under the circumstances mentioned
bas bought property, even if he is buying out
the rights of the vendor, should not by reason
of bis purchase acquire more rights than the
vendor had to seli. That is what, under this
bill, he would be doing; he would be acquiring more than the vendor had to sell. Why
shouid a purchaser get more than a vendor
has to seli, or why should he buy property
subject to disabilities and escape them. by
reason of an over-generous act of this kind.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think I shaîl have to
leave the officers of the Department of Justice,
who I am told laboured very bard over this
section, to answer my honourable friend.
Han. Mr. ]Roebuck: The mountain laboured
and brougbt forth a mouse.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and tbe bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

EMERGENCY GOLD MINING ASSISTANCE
BILL
SECOND READING

Han. John C. Davis moved the second reading of Bull 242, an Act to amend the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act, which
this bill amends, was first enacted in 1948.
Its purpose was to assist Canadian gold mine
operators to meet an unusual situation. This
situation developed as a result of the operation of two economic factors, namely, a fixed
price for gold of $35 an ounce in terms of
the United States dollar and, on the other
hand, steadily rising costs of supplies, equipment, labour and services.
Under the 1948 Act, what has since been
described as the "cost-aid" program was
instituted for a three-year period, to cover
the .calendar years 1948, 1949 and 1950.
Although this program was not intended as
a cure-all, it has undoubtedly served as a
stabilizing influence and has contributed substantially toward enabling the eligible mines
to continue in operation and to maintain
the mining communities dependent upon
them.
In 1950, following representations by the
industry, the government decided to recommend the continuance of cost-aid for 1951.
Conditions that led to this decision have persisted, and the present amending bill provides for the extension of the Act during
1952 and 1953.
The only other point contained in this bill
deals with the clarifying of the application
of the formula used in determining the
amount of aid given to each of the mines
eligible under the Act. Experience has
shown that under the formula established by
the 1951 amendment, some mines received
less assistance in the last quarter of 1950
than was intended. By the proposed clarification, this situation would be remedied.
In October, 1951, Canadian gold producers were given access to premium markets
for industrial gold. A number of mines are
utilizing this opportunity, but the new outlet has not solved the problem facing mines
having relatively high production costs.
The importance of gold mining to the
economic well-being of the country need not
be emphasized. Over a period of many years
gold has been the chief single contributor
to the value of Canada's mineral output.
Even in 1951, when gold production was well
below the peak reached in 1941, output of
the metal was valued at nearly $160 million.
We are now witnessing in Canada a great
up-surge of activity in connection with base
metals. I mention this because it is the
search for gold that has led to many, if not
most, of the base metal discoveries made in
Canada to date.
Although prospecting for gold is less active
now than before the last war, it continues to

be a chief contributing factor in the opening up of new areas for mineral development and the establishment of new communities. Accordingly it is considered by
the government that the measure of aid provided by the Act is vital, not only to the
best interests of the gold mining industry,
but of the country as a whole.
I wish to emphasize that this amending
bill does not deal with the broad considerations of national and international monetary
policies, nor is it intended, as I have indicated, as a final solution of the production
problems of the gold mining industry. Ra-ther,
it is for the purpose of giving emergency
assistance to the industry over a difficult
period, and of extending the opportunity of
the qualifying mines to cope with and work
out their problems.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read a second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Davis:

Honourable

senators,

I

move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADA-FRANCE INCOME TAX
CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second

reading of Bill 289, an Act to amend the
Canada-France
Income
Tax Convention
Act, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, a year ago
a convention between Canada and France
was entered into and duly signed, in Ottawa,
by the diplomatic representatives of each
country. The convention was approved by
parliament
and incorporated
into our
statutes, being Chapter 40 of the Statutes of
1951, which was assented to on June 30, 1951.
Under this convention it is provided that
a French enterprise in Canada will be taxed
with respect to its industrial, mining, commercial or financial profits to the extent only
that these are attributable to its permanent
establishment in Canada. There is a similar
provision in relation to Canadian institutions
in France.
This convention was never adopted and
passed by the parliament of France, and in
this connection I should like to quote what
the French Prime Minister, who is also
Minister of Finance, stated in the French
National Assembly on May 9, of this year:
The Convention signed between France and Canada on the 16th March, 1951, could not be submitted
for the approval of the French Parliament because
it was thought desirable, in advance, to complete
and clarify certain of its provisions.
However,

JUNE 5. 1952
agreement on the matters in doubt can now be
considered as having been definitely settled and
everything will be done to complete the necessary
proceedings for putting the Convention into force
within as short a delay as possible.

This statement by the French Prime Minister
is actually the reason why this bill is now
before us.
The purpose of the bill is to approve a
codicil to the Income Tax Convention signed
last year between Canada and France. A
new sub-paragraph (iii) will be added to
paragraph 6 of Article II of the Agreement,
and the present sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph 6 will become sub-paragraph (iv). The
amendment is to clarify and complete the
definition of "permanent establishment", and
the whole object of the legislation is te try
to avoid double taxation of profits or any
evasion of income tax on profits that may
be made by an institution of one country
located in the other.
To make this point clear, I should like to
read the new provision to be added to Article
II of the Agreement:
(iii) When a company of one of the states derives
profits, in accordance with contracts settled in said
state, from the sale of goods or merchandise kept
in storage within the territory of the other state
for the convenience of delivery and not for publicity purposes, such profits are not considered as
resulting from a permanent establishment of the
company located in the other state, notwithstanding
the tact that offers of purchase have been collected
by an agent who has transmitted them to the company for final acceptation.

If a French firm has a warehouse in Canada
which contains French wines, or fine luxury
textiles or perfumes-the three main items
now coming into this country from Franceand has a salesman here for the purpose of
promoting the sale of the contents of that
warehouse, the volume of business will not be
subject to income tax. This is simply because
the sale contract will be subject to approval
and signing in France. Likewise, the business done by a Canadian institution having
goods stored in a warehouse in France will
not be subject to taxation, because the binding contract will have been initiated and
signed in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does this come under
income tax?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: There will be no sales
tax. The business done by each country in
the other country will be free from taxation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is income tax, is
it not?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Yes, it is that part of
the income tax that relates to taxes on profits
of corporations. It is hoped that this legislatien will promote trade between the two
countries.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Could the honourable
senator describe what goods we might store
in a warehouse in France?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I can answer that question by saying our exports to France far
exceed our imports from that country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Of what do our exports to
France consist?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Pulp and paper products and non-ferrous metals. Our export of
newsprint to France has been greatly
increased, and in the past we have sent a good
deal of fruit, particularly apples, to that
country. But that product has not been
exported there in any large quantity lately.
Most of the apples produced in the Maritime
Provinces have been shipped to England.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: British Columbia and
Ontario, ho*ever, had a market for high
grade apples in France.
The house might be interested in a few
figures showing what the volume of our trade
with France has been in the last year or
two. In 1950 we exported to France goods
of a total value of $17 million, and our imports
from France were valued at $15 million. In
1951 our exports were $46 million, and imports
$24 million. In the first three months of this
year our exports amounted to $15 million, but
imports declined to $4 million, largely because
of France's shortage of dollars.
The important point to bear in mind is that
during the war we lent France more than
$200 million, and the annual interest on that
loan is at least $8 million. The only way by
which payment of that interest can be realized
is through the importation of French goods; so
any increase in this trade will be to the
advantage of Canada as well as of France. I
think the amendment to the convention will
facilitate trade relations between the two
countries.
This is really a diplomatic matter, rather
than one of trade and commerce, for it
has been the subject of definite understanding
and signature between the French Ambassador in this country and our Department
of External Affairs. We, agreeable to implementation of the amendment last year, had
it incorporated in our statutes, but France
did not take similar action at that time because of a desire to clarify the question
of what is "a permanent establishment" and
to overcome any possibility of double taxation.
If honourable members require further
information they will be able to obtain it
in committee.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Has my honourable
friend a breakdown of figures showing how
much wheat and fiour we exported in 1951?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I have not got those
figures, but they can easily be obtained.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not say that I am going to vote against
this bill, for maybe we should pass it in
order to helýp France; but my business sense
has not been deceived a bit by the remarks of
my friend the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert).
The effect of the convention is simply this.
The French will have salesmen here to sell
goods as opportunity offers, and of course
supplies of French goods will have to be
maintained in warehouses here in order that
reasonably prompt delivery may be made.
Now, if that is not carrying on business dealings in Canada, I do not know what those
words mean. The transactions are of the
same kind as those carried on by any merchant. The senator for Ottawa, for instance,
might have a manufacturing plant in Montreal
and sales branches at Toronto, Winnipeg, and
other centres. His salesmen at those centres
would take orders for the sale of goods there.
They might have to get in touch with their
head office to have acceptance of the orders
confirmed, but there is no doubt that my
honourable friend would be doing business in
those places where he maintained branches.
This requirement of the convention that
orders must be sent to France is all camouflage, just nonsense. What do the businessmen
in France know about sales that their representatives make here? If I were in business
and one of those representatives got an order
from me, he might go through the procedure
of notifying his principals in France "I can
sell John T. Haig certain goods, for cash, or
on certain terms", and after getting formal
approval of the sale he would make delivery
to me.
I am not being fooled a bit by this convention. What we are doing, actually, is
to allow French companies to sel1 goods in
Canada at a profit, in competition with
Canadian goods, and to escape taxes that
Canadian companies have to pay.
The honourable gentleman pointed out
what he called the benefits we would derive
from France in return for the concessions
made by this convention. I was careful to
ask him about this. Now, the fact is that
we do not need to maintain any warehouses
in France for the storage of goods that we
sell to that country. Metals, for instance,
are in strong demand by France for its war
production. Instead of needing space for
the storage of supplies of metals in France,

we have the problem of being able ta supply
France with all the metals it would take
from us, and to get payment for the sales we
make. We do not need to have a whole
range of copper and zinc and lead lying
around in storehouses in France waiting
for someone to come to purchase them.
Nor do we need to maintain any supply of
pulp or paper in that country. Al these
commodities are in strong demand there.
France would buy them frorn any other
country than Canada that could and would
sell them to her at a lower price. This is
purely a business matter for ber, but not
for us. We can sell more goods of this
class than we are able to produce. In fact,
some companies have been required to place
their shipments to various countries on a
quota basis.
Please do not misunderstand me. I am
not saying that I, a Canadian, am unwilling
to vote for the amendment to this convention. But let no one ever say to me afterwards, "You voted for that treaty and did
not know what it meant." I know what
it means-at least I think I do. If I were
a French manufacturer of perfumes I should
like to see this bill pass, so that I could
sell my perfumes in Winnipeg or Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Or in Toronto. When the
bill is passed the manufacturer's representative here will be able to make sales to retail
or wholesale outlets. If he cables to Paris
"I ýcan sell $5,000 of perfume to So-and-so,"
he will only be fulfilling a requirement that
is nothing but camouflage. The manufacturer in France will have to depend on
the judgment of his representative here as
to whether the credit of the purchaser is
good or not.
Now, I do not know why we have to do
this kind of thing at all. I do not know why
we acted as we did in that wheat business
with Britain. We pretended to make a deal
with Britain and sell ber wheat at the world
price, when we knew all the time that we
were doing nothing of the kind. We knew
that we were losing a large sum of money.
The other day in Brockville the Right
Honourable Mr. Gardiner, the Minister of
Agriculture, said that the loss was $300 million. His estimate was low, for we lost a
lot more than that. If my friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) were in the chamber at
the moment he would interrupt me to say
that the rest of Canada gave the West $65
million, and I would repeat to him that our
western farmers lost more than $300 million
on that deal, which was undertaken on behalf
of Canada as a whole. We should have said
plainly to Britain "Canada is selling you this

JUNE 5, 1952
wheat at a price which we know is $300
million less than we could charge you, but
we want you to get the benefit." But because
we did not express ourselves frankly, some
"ginks" in Britain have said, "We put it all
over the Canadians." They did not put it
over us at all. We knew what we were doing.
I am one who got up in this house and protested against the form of the wheat agreement with Britain.
Similarly, I am protesting against this
convention with France, because I do not
want business people in Paris to be able
to say "Those Canadians must be stupid
fellows to agree to an arrangement of this
kind." If we want to give France money, if
that is the proper thing to do, I am willing
to vote for it, but I am certainly not going
to sit silent here and not protest against
legislation which I know means something
different from what it pretends to mean.
I know that the bill is a government bill,
and I would not ask supporters of the
government to vote against the measure on
my say-so. But I do protest against this kind
of business. We do too much of it, and our
taxes have become too high. My friend from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchil) told us
today about the high taxes on telephone companies. The tide of public patience is running out, and nonsensical arrangements of
the kind that we have before us today are
largely responsible. The sooner we Canadians realize that, the better for us. I may
not have much ability as a businessman, but
I at least know when the other fellow is
"putting it over on me." I may be willing
to let him do it, but I want to tell him that
I know he is doing it.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I correct the
impression my honourable friend has given,
that war supplies are included in this
measure? That is not correct. Any shipment of war materials to France is under a
different arrangement entirely. Non-ferrous
metals would of course be more in the line
of farm implements and things of that nature,
which have been going to France for years.
I may say to my friend that a similar diplomatic arrangement exists between France
and England, and we have precisely the
same arrangement in a convention with New
Zealand. It seems to me that ail this fulmination about throwing our money away
is ridiculous.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would point out to my
friend that he bas already spoken on this
bill.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am only replying to
a question asked by the honourable leader.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not ask you a
question.
55708-27

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: You are away off the
mark.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not!
Hon. Mr. Lambert: You are a hundred per
cent off.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the mover of the second reading of the bill
has a right to close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But Your Honour did not
say that.
The Hon. the Speaker: Perhaps I did not
say it, but the honourable member still has
the right to close the debate. As sponsor,
he is the only one who can speak a second
time.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am finished.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Perhaps I may be allowed
to ask a question.
The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable
gentleman wishes only to ask a question,
that is all right, but the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has already
spoken twice and closed the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I rise to a point of
order? The senator from Halifax should
perhaps ask for the consent of the bouse
to speak. For my part I am quite willing
that he should be allowed to speak.
The Hon. the Speaker: With the leave of
the Senate, he may ask a question.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you. I had intended
speaking very much along the same line as
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig); but at the same time I was wondering whether the interpretation I had placed
on the proposed legislation was the correct
one. I am particularly interested in the
warehousing of foreign goods, and the effect
of the convention upon them.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I ask the honourable senator whether he is asking a question or expressing his own thoughts?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I say a word on
the matter of the rules? Do not the rules
of the house require that notice be given
that when the mover of a motion speaks
a second time he thereby closes the debate?
In this case it seems that the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
thought he was answering a question asked
by the honourable leader opposite. That
would hardly close the debate, unless the
house has been notified to that effect. No
such notice was given in this instance, and
it seems to me that the debate is still
open.
The Hon. the Speaker: The Senate has
given leave to the honourable senator from

SENATE
Halifax to ask a question, but he does not
seem to be asking a question. He may now
ask for leave to make a speech, if he wishes
to do so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, you perhaps
misunderstood my suggestion of a few minutes
ago. I suggested that the honourable senator
should have the consent of the house to
speak, and I said that personally I was prepared to consent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Carried!
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, my
remarks will be very brief. I was about to ask
a question in my earlier remarks, but first I
wanted to give the senator from Ottawa a
little of the background.
I have in mind a warehouse in Canada
which is controlled by people in France, and
in which is stored linen goods, lace, and
fancy articles of that nature, to be sold in
competition with similar goods manufactured
in Canada. On the one side the Canadian
manufacturer would naturally have to pay
income tax on his profits; but on the other,
according to the interpretation of the bill
given by the sponsor, the French warehouse
owner would not pay income tax on the profits
from any transaction which he had within a
stated time. That seems clearly to be discrimination in favour of a foreign competitor,
to the detriment of the Canadian manufacturer.
My question is this: Am I properly interpreting the terms of the convention in concluding that in the one case the French firm
would not pay income tax, while the Canadian
manufacturer would, over the same period of
time?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My understanding of this
matter springs entirely from my reading of
Article I of the schedule, which my honourable friend can read as well as I can. It makes
reference to goods in storage, but does not
necessarily mean in a warehouse owned by
the French. It may be a rented warehouse
in which the goods are stored. It is a wellknown fact that quantities of French wines
are stored in Canada for use here; but the
point is, the storage places are not considered
permanent establishments. It is on the basis
of "a permanent establishment" that taxes
would, be levied on the business done. A sale
legally takes place in Canada only when the
contract is issued from Paris and is signed by
the seller of the goods. The same conditions
apply to a Canadian company doing business
in Paris: it is a mutual and reciprocal arrangement between the two countries, for the convenience of exporters of goods. Any Canadian
manufacturer of wines, say in the Niagara

Peninsula-if anybody drinks that kind of
stuff-undoubtedly has to pay taxes, while
the French wine distributor does not. That is
the situation.
Hon. J. G. Fogo: Honourable senators, if
I am in order, it might be proper for me
to point out that the seeming freedom from
taxation does not exist. If I understand
the situation correctly, the French merchant
who has goods in Canada temporarily, and
who sells them in lany quantity, has his
income taxed in France. In the same manner, a Canadian who does business in France
will not be taxed in that country, but will
pay taxes under the Canadian laws; and,
if I am correct, under our income tax law
he will get an allowance for any taxes he
has paid abroad. So in the end it is probably immaterial from the standpoint of a
taxpayer whether he pays the tax in France
or in Canada. But I think you have to consider here that there is one vendor, who
rnay or may not be subject to two taxes,
depending on whether the transaction is
regarded as taxable in Canada or taxable
in France.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: In view of the interest which has been shown, I have no hesitation about sending this bill to the Committee on External Relations, if such is the
wish of honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I move that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
External Relations.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
all the items on our Order Paper have been
dealt with, and I see no prospect of other
legislation which is likely to require our
immediate attention. I would remind honourable senators, however, that there is considerable work before the various standing
committees, in particular, the Committee on
Banking and Commerce and its subcommittee, which have been engaged in a long
and detailed examination of the Criminal
Code Bill. In this connection I wish to
thank, on my own behalf and for the Senate
as a whole, the honourable members from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Vancouver South

JUNE 5. 1952
(Hon. Mr. Farris), and the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)-who lias
attended whenever his other duties perrnitted-for the Urne they have spent on Vhis
matter.
While I arn anxious to expedite our business, I do not think it is necessary for the
Senate to convene on Monday, but I hope
that ail members will be here on Tuesday
-afternoon, as I have arranged with the Minister of Health and Welfare to attend and

55708-27J

explain Bill E-1l, an Act respecting Food,
Drugs, Cosmetics and Therapeutic Devices,
of which I shall nove second reading. Moreover, a!ter I have conferred with respective
chairmen, I hope to arrange for meetings of
the standing committees on Tuesday morning,
with a view to facilitating the consideration
of some of the legisiation which is before
them.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, June
10, at 3 p.rn.

FOOD AND DRUGS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second
reading of Bill E-11, an Act respecting food,
drugs, cosmetics and therapeutic devices.
Hon. Paul Martin, M. P. (Minister of
National Health and Welfare). Honourable
senators, in speaking to the second reading

JUNE 10, 1952
of this bih, I may say at the outset what
a great privilege and honour it is for me
for the first time to find myself speaking
in this place about a bill that may possibly
lack many of the exciting qualities of other
legisliative projects, but the importance of
which in terms of its usefulness to the
nation, will not for a moment be doubted.
This -bill seeks to provide for a revision
and a consolidation of the existing Food and
Drugs Act, a measure which. has been on
our statute books since 1874, and which is
looked upon by most countries in the western world as having set the pattern for food
and drug administration and legislation.
Amongst other things, this bill attempts
to define a drug more realistically. Under
the existing Act any therapeutie device, or
a cosmetic, is included in the term "drug".
That is not only linguisti'cally wrong, but
from the point of view of experience of
administration its retention would be unwise.
Every food consumed or offered for sale for
consumption in this country is in some way
affected by this Act. We have thiroughout
the country a number of inspectors whose
job it is, with regard to food produced in as
well as food imported into Canada, te ensure
by examination that certain qualities and
certain standards are maintained, and that
no adulteration exists in food offered for
sale.
Apart from the effort at consolidation and
more orderly arrangement of sections, the
main changes which the bill would make
are to provide for the keeping of pertinent
records by manufacturers, and the prohibition of the sale of foods, drugs and cosmetics
that are packaged or stored in an insanitary
place or under unsanitary conditions. Honourable senators may be particularly interested in a new feature which provides, for
the first time, for the use of the judicial
process in the forfeiture of any article which
may be deemed by a dominion analyst not
to conform to the provisions of the Act.
At the present time the powers of the
minister under the Act are very great, and
it has been felt for some time that there
should be a limit to his ministerial powers,
and that any interference with the use of
property should be only after the exercise
of the judicial process.
For instance, it
frequently happens that goods of very great
pecuniary value are seized, and forfeiture
ensues, not upon the ruling of a court but,
first, through seizure by an inspector and a
report by a dominion analyst, followed by
the decision of the minister in the exercise
of his discretion. It has been thought that
hereafter, except by the consent of the
owner, no forfeiture of goods should take

place unless there has been a determination
by a judicial officer as to whether or net
the goods are in conformity with the Act,
and as to whether under the circumstances
the forfeiture should be undertaken. I think
that is an important change in our food and
drug administration.
It follows what is
called the "due process of law" clause in
the corresponding Act in the United States.
At the present time the minister's power is
very great. If the dominion analyst thinks
that a particular food, whether made in this
country or elsewhere, is adulterated and that
its qualities and standards do not conform
to our regulations, he makes a certificate
to that effect, and the minister orders the
forfeiture. In one case ,within my experience the forfeiture involved as much as
half a million dollars. It is proposed in
this legislation that disputed forfeitures shall
be dealt with by judicial action.
Honourable senators, it is not the wish of
the government that this legislation should be
finalized this year. An Act such as this
depends for its successful operation on the
collaboration and co-operation that it receives
from industry generally. Our attempt has
been not to coerce but to co-operate with
industry. We would want to make sure, therefore, that some of the changes that we have
in mindi are satisfactory to industry or, at
any rate, that industry shall have an opportunity of knowing what we intend to do and
of testing the wisdom of our proposais. I
hope that it may be possible for you to use
the mechanism of a committee to afford industry and others concerned an opportunity of
making representations as to the proposais
that have been put forth in this legislation
for the protection of the 'Canadian consumer,
and that consideration will be given later to
the question of whether the legislation should
be adopted in its entirety or modifications
should be made.
In speaking to the second reading of this
bill I should like to assure this house that
I speak to a measure that means a great
deal not only to the relations between our
department and industry, but towards maintaining the high quality and high standards
that goods produced in this country are known
to enjoy among the other nations of the world.
This is an unexciting but extremely important
measure.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
may I first of all congratulate the distinguished member of the government (Hon.
Mr. Martin) who has just explained this
measure. He has given the kind of explanation I like. I had thought that the government intended to finalize this legislation at

SENATE
this session, but I am pleased that the minister would like to see it go to a Senate committee for study. Speaking for the house, I
can assure the minister that this legislation
will receive the most earnest consideration
at the hands of whatever Senate committee it
may be referredi to. We shall give every
opportunity to persons who wish to be heard.
Further, we shall seriously consider any representations that are made to us, but shall
always keep in mind the fact that we, like
the members of the other house, represent all
the people of Canada, and from that standpoint we shall judge the legislation.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
hesitate to say anything on an occasion of
this kind, but I notice that the bill has something to do with food, and I have one or two
remarks to make on that subject. I think
that the trouble with a large proportion of
our young Canadians today is that they are
half starved, and I am wondering if it would
not be possible for the minister to have
included in this bill, or another bill, a requirement that a minimum number of ounces of
bread be served to a workingman at a meal.
One who moves about the country as I do
cannot help noticing the kind of food that is
served in many public places, such as
restaurants and on railroad dining cars. I
often wonder just what the bakers do to our
good Canadian wheat in order to produce the
kind of stuff that is called bread nowadays.
When I was a young man going about from
one place to another and working hard, I
would eat a full-course meal, sometimes composed largely of meat, three times a day. But
today many people, especially those who eat
in public places, cannot afford a full-courq
meal. Look at the prices charged for eggs!
Though farmers have been selling them for
as low as 14 to 17 cents a dozen, the charge
for a single egg in the dining cars of our
own railroad is 25 cents. This is a condition
that I think will have to be remedied in the
interest of the health of our people.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the minister allow
one question? Does he think it is in the
interest of health to permit the manufacture
in Canada of some drug or device which
authorities in his department consider detrimental to the health of the people of Canada,
but which under this Act may be exported
to other countries? I notice that section 30
of the bill permits of the exportation of drugs
and devices which cannot legally be consumed in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, the
problem there arises because of the fact that
the definition of the word "drug" includes
a cosmetic or a therapeutic device. When
the word "drug" is used in the section of the
Act to which the honourable senator has

drawn my attention, it will have reference
mainly to something that is not necessarily
a drug. If the honourable senator has in
mind a specific drug, as such, and not a
therapeutic device or a cosmetic, I should
be very glad to have the name of that product, because certainly the intention is not
to allow the export from this country of a
drug, as such, that is regarded here to be
contrary to good health or what is needed
for the proper functioning of the human
body.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I thank the minister for his
answer. I had in mind not only drugs but
packaged foods. If food is not considered
fit for consumption in Canada, should we
allow it to be shipped abroad?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Foods are in another
category. Our standards of quality in this
country are higher than those in any other
country in the world, except the United
States, where the standards are pretty much
the same as our own. But there are countries that do not require the same degree of
quality and purity that we require in this
country. Adulteration of itself is not necessarily a source of bad health. A food may
be adulterated, in the sense that it does not
come up to our high standards, without being
in any way injurious to health. It is only
because we are using the Food and Drugs
Act for the purpose, among other things,
of raising the quality of our foods, that we
insist on certain standards of quality and
purity of foods, irrespective of health hazards which are dealt with separately. For
instance, we import a lot of dates from certain countries, and we do not allow their
entry if a certain percentage of adulteration
is present. But if we ourselves were producers of dates there would be no reason
why we could not ship to another country
dates containing a larger percentage of adulteration than is permitted here, if the laws
of that country did not forbid such import.
Of course, if food is of such a quality as to
be injurious to health, that is a different
matter.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Public
Health and Welfare.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. Gordon Fogo moved the second
reading of Bill F-11, an Act to incorporate
the Canadian Shipowners Mutual Assurance
Association.

JUNE 10, 1952
He said: Honourable senators, you will have
noticed that this is a bill to incorporate an
insurance association or club, which will
operate on a mutual basis, for the particular
purpose of taking care of what is known as
war risk insurance on Canadian ships. The
incorporators are representative shipowners,
and if the association is incorporated, membership in the association will be open to all
shipowners in Canada.
During the war most privately owned Canadian ships were insured in one of the United
Kingdom associations or clubs, which instead
of retaining the risk secured reinsurance
from the United Kingdom Government on a
premium basis. In the early part of the war
the British Government provided reinsurance
on -the basis of 80 per cent of the risk; later
this was increased to 96 per cent.
That practice continues, but from the standpoint of Canadian shipowners there are
certain objections to participation in United
Kingdom underwriting transactions. These
are: (1) the insurance values fixed by the
British Government are generally considered
insufficient according to Canadian standards;
(2) there is no provision for excess insurance;
(3) in the event of loss, a portion of the
proceeds is retained in the United Kingdom
until replacement is effected. As a consequence of these restrictions, if I may call them
that, the majority of Canadian shipowners
procure marine insurance and war risk insurance in the open market, where underwriters
will not accept coverage for more than three
months, and then only on policies which are
subject to what is known as the "forty-eighthour" clause. This clause provides that in the
event of an outbreak of hostilities underwriters can give shipowners forty-eight hours
notice to terminate the insurance or to
re-insure at a premium to be agreed upon at
a rate much higher than ordinary.
Some time ago the Canadian shipowners
took this matter up with the Maritime Commission and, in turn, with the Department
of Finance of Canada.

An official of the

department who was in the United Kingdom
at the time was therefore able to confer with
the operators of the United Kingdom club
or the United Kingdom association. An opinion was obtained from the leading authority
in England, Mr. Dawson Miller, who is the
senior partner of a firm which, in turn,
manages the United Kingdom association.
Mr. Miller was of the opinion that a Canadian club would 'be feasible, provided sufficient support was obtainable from Canadian
shipowners and satisfactory re-insurance was
available through an agency of the Canadian
government.
The matter was followed up at a meeting
held in November of last year under the

auspices of the Maritime Commission. At
that meeting there were present representatives of the Marine Insurance Advisory
Committee, the Maritime Commission, the
Eastern and Western Shipowners Advisory
Committee, and some others. At this meeting it was made known that the Canadian
government was prepared to negotiate a
reinsurance agreement with a suitable mutual
association of Canadian shipowners. There
was one proviso; that the association must
obtain highly skilled and fully experienced
management for its operations.
Such an operation in Canada has been
considered desirable for two reasons. First,
financial security would be provided through
a government agency, and second, the association and its operations would be located in
Canada and the insurance value would be
determined on a Canadian basis.
Mr. Miller attended the meeting to which
I have referred, and indicated that he
would be willing to lend his services in
organizing the association. He also undertook to provide one or more members of his
London staff on a permanent basis, for the
newly incorporated association. It was his
opinion that the association would require
support from the Canadian shipowners, by
way of participation or insurable value, to
the extent of approximately $100 mill.ion. A
canvass of shipowners recently made indicated that insurable value to at least $112
million would be avallable.
The association will have a board of directors, composed of Canadian shipowners.
I should perhaps have pointed out earlier
that the government reinsurance provisions
will be embodied in legislation to be presented to the other house this session. It
will provide only for the reinsurance of war
risks.
In other respects the bill contains the usual
clauses for the incorporation of such an
association. It has been examined by the
officials of the Senate, and will in due course
be referred to a committee for further
examination.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What capital does the
association have?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It is purely a mutual organization. The shipowners are the members of
the association, and they will contribute to
the extent of the insurance which the association carries.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has the association no
working capital at all?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Apparently not.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then how does it meet
its office expenses?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Premiums are payable in
advance, I understand.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Where do you get the
figure of $112 million?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does this business come
under the control of the Insurance Department?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Yes. I neglected to say that
conferences have taken place on this legislation with the Superintendent of Insurance,
the Department of Finance and the Maritime
Commission.
The honourable senator from King's (Hon.
Mr. McDonald) asked where the figure of
$112 million came from. I said earlier that
a canvass of Canadian shipowners indicated
that the volume of insurable value available
to participate in the venture up to the present
time was known to be $112 million, which is
somewhat more than the minimum indicated
by Mr. Miller, upon which the association
could start.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: How many members are
represented by that sum of money?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I have not that exact figure;
but I think that practically all the independent deep-sea shipping interests in Canada
were represented at the meeting to which I
referred.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How would the association pay its early losses, if it had no working
capital?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They could not have
losses until they had premiums.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I must object, Mr. Speaker.
My honourable friend should ask his question
so that we on this side of the house can hear
it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am sorry; I directed my
question to the gentleman who was explaining the bill. I wanted to know how losses
could be paid without working capital, or
before premiums were built up?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was curious to know
how the association would pay its ordinary
expenses. I hope, for instance, that the solicitor who drew this bill will get paid. How will
the stenographers be paid?

Hon. Mr. Haig: Do not worry about the
solicitors.
Hon. Mr. Davis: Would not the answer be
that all members of the association would
become co-insurers to a certain amount of
value; the association could operate on a
mutual basis without working capital, and in
that way meet its early claims.
Hon. Mr.
presume.

Baird:

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable senator if he regards the organization
which this bill would create as one calculated
to encourage the development of the shipbuilding industry in Canada, which really
has been within the purview of the Maritime
Commission?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I think that, indirectly,
such would be the effect, in so far as the
bill assures or renders more practicable the
operation of ships in Canada by Canadian
ship owners.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The standard of value,
too, would be set on a Canadian basis.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Oh, yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

The report was read by the Clerc Assistant
as follows:The Standing Commrittee on External Relations, to
whom was referred Bill 289, an Act to amend, the
Canada-France Income Tax Convention Act, 1951,

THIRD READING

The -Han. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shal1, this bill be rcad the third.
trne?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave, I move
the Vhird reading now.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honeurab1le fsenators,
I shail not take up rnuch of your Urne.
I objected ta this bill on the motion for
second rcading, and, having listened ta -the
dissertation in committee, object more strenuousiy naw. Our incarne tax conventions with
the United States, Great Britain and Sweden
are ail on the same lime as this one. AUl of
thern, inclu'ding the one before us, provide
for deduotion of 15 per cent in respect of
certain transactions, 'but under the terms of
this agreement, a French flitn having a wareliouse in Canada, so long as its sales contracts are subjeot ta confirmation in France,'
is assumed ta be doing business in Canada.
1 object Vo, that provision. The best explanation we coiAd get this morninýg was that the
abject of the French governiment in securing
this provision was ta enable French Wine
manufacturers 'ta send their products ta
Caniada and Vo hold them in warehouses
here for distribution, thus-contracts of sale
having Vo, be approved in Paris, and no business actuaily being dwrne in Canada-escaping -the 15 per cent tax. -In reply ta my
objection, members a! the conunittee stated
that a similar right was accorded Vo aour
exporters. But it is Vo be pointed out that
aur cammodÀties salcable in France are not
of the saine Içind as those that corne here:
55708-28

from France. We seil minerais, and we cIe
not stock them overseas. We can seil them
anywh.ere and our custamers must buy fron
us, so that there is no advantage in our
keeping a stock overseas.
The purpose of international agreements
is to prevent fraud between the traders of
different countries. If the agîreement we
entered into wîith the United States, Great
Britain and Sweden was good eough for
those countries, I cannot see why we shoul1d
now aiilow a legal fiction to sULp in whereby,
bectause asale contract must be confirmed in
Paris, the goods exported here and warehoused here are not ta be subi ect to incarne
tax. If any-body wants Vo buy liquor from
Francoe, the matter of confirmation is of no
importance; and there is no doubt that these
deals are for cash.
Whether they are
entered into by the government of Manitoba
or of Quebec or any other place, confirmation
is a mere fonmabity. In any event I abject
ta having anc kind of incarne Vax agreement for one country and anather kind for
another. This kind of an agreement wil
lead to fraud, and neither the niercilhants in
Canada or in France will be lany furthcr
ahead. The Canadi-an merchant wil pay
15 iper cent in Canada, and he wiill get -a 15
per cent reduction in France, and vice
versa. Why the fiction? I cannat sec who
benefits at ail, except that the government
of France wa-nts Vo take that rnuch more
money.
The honourable senator who presented the
report (Han. Mîr. Lambert) said in cammittee
that we had lent money to, France and that
she required more money from us in order
to pay the intcrest on what she had borrowed.
That is flot the way it should be. If we
loaned rnoncy ta France she should pay it
back. If -we wan-t to give her money, that is a
different thing. I have no objection to lcnding money ta any o! the European countries
which are 'having such a desperate time at
present, 'but I do flot believe that through any
formi of camouflage we should allaw one
country ta avoid paying taxes when we ask
other countries to pay them. I aibject to
the legisiation on this ground and not on any
business principle; I like to do business in
the sanie way with ail countries.
If we agree to this convention, countries
like Swedcn will want the same arrangement.
Our govcrnment confirmcd an agreement a
year ago, as did the United States, Britain
and Sweden, but the French parliament
refused ta conffin it because it wantcd this
codicil added. The Government of France
asked for this cadicil because it did not wish
to have its merchants pay any taxes ta
Canada.

SENATE
I am opposed to the ratification of this
measure, and although I am not going to ask
for a vote I do want to make known my
personal views on the matter.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
in all fairness I think i.t should be said that
this measure is purely a device to avoid
double taxation or possible tax evasion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If there is any advantage to be gained at all, it will come to
Canada, because our exports to France far
exceed our imports from that country. This
is just a convention between the two countries to avoid the possibility of double taxation in assessing income tax on the profits
of corporations. The Canadian firms that
ship goods to France pay the corporation tax
on the profits they make in this country,
whether the goods are produced for domestic
consumption or for export; similarly, the
French firms that sell wines, perfumes or
high grade textiles in this country, pay an
income tax in France. This is purely a
device or instrument for the purpose of making quite clear that in neither country there
will be double taxation against nationals of
the parties to the agreement.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I disagree entirely with the statement just
made. There is no question of double taxation here at all. A Canadian merchant, in
order to benefit by this treaty would have to
have a warehouse in France; and when his
representative there got an order for goods
stored in the warehouse he would have to
communicate with his principal here, and
obtain his approval of the order. When all that
was done it would be said that the contract
was made in Canada, not in France, and
therefore any profit on the transaction would
benefit from the tax exemption under the
convention. And under this convention a
French merchant who wishes to trade in
Canada will have his goods stored in a warehouse here, and when his representative
receives an order for goods anywhere in
this country he will communicate with the
French merchant and have the sale confirmed;
and provided this condition is complied with
the profit on the transaction will not be
subject to tax in Canada.
The principle, involved, it seems to me
is a very vicious one indeed. Just consider
what might happen if we had a similar
convention with the United States. Under the
convention American merchants would sell
far more goods in Canada than we would sell
in the United States, and therefore the amount
of Canadian taxes which American merchants
would escape would be far larger than the

amount of American taxes that Canadian
merchants escaped on sales in the United
States.
I do not see how this convention has
anything whatever to do with double taxation,
and I am strongly opposed to a deal of this
kind.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I wonder whether we are devoting a
lot of time to something that is very simple.
As I read Article I in the codicil to the agreement between France and Canada, it seems to
me to be designed to make it more convenient
for French merchants to deliver products to
purchasers in Canada, and for Canadian merchants to deliver products that they sell to
purchasers in France. As a matter of convenience and good business sense, and having
regard to the distance between the two countries, the idea is to facilitate trade by storing
Canadian goods in warehouses in France, and
French goods in warehouses in Canada, and
having deliveries made from the warehouses
in the country where the goods are stored
rather than from the country where the goods
are produced.
All that this article says is that, for income
tax purposes, the French merchant whose
goods are warehoused and delivered in Canada shall not be regarded as carrying on
business in this country, and that any profits
he makes on these transactions shall not be
,taxable here; and, vice versa, that the Canadian merchant whose goods are warehoused
and delivered in France shall not be regarded
as carrying on business in that country, and
that any profits he makes on those transactions shall not be taxable in France. This
works both ways. For Canada to say that
profits resulting from business done here
in that fashion will not be looked upon as
income earned by the French company in
Canada, and for France to say that it will
disregard the profits so made in that country
by a Canadian company, does not seem to me
to be a violent or shocking extension of a
law to be applied as between two countries.
That is all the codicil does.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But why should there
be a different agreement with Britain and the
United States?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As a free-lance in this
discussion, I might offer the answer that the
French government was the first to think of
this angle; and it may very well be that in
due course the other conventions will be
amended. I see no objection to this convention.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on division.

JUNE 11, 1952
INCOME TAX BILL
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden presented and moved concurrence in the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, on Bill
205, an Act to amend the Income Tax Act.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
Your committee recommend that they be authorized to print 500 copies in English and 200 copies in
French of its proceedings on the said bill, and that
Rule 100 be suspended in relation to the said
printing.

The report was concurred in.
Hon. Mr. Hayden presented a further report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, on Bill 205, an Act to amend the
Income Tax Act.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to whom was referred Bill 205, an Act to
amend the Income Tax Act, have in obedience to
the order of reference of June 5, 1951, examined
the said bill and now beg leave to report the same
without any amendment.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the report is concurred in, I move,
seconded by the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), that the report
of the committee be not now concurred in,
but that it be referred back to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce for
further consideration.
The other evening, on the motion for
second reading of this bill, the honourable
senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchill) drew the attention of the house to
section 25 of the bill, which would extend
certain tax exemptions to specified public
utilities, not including telephone companies.
That question came up when the bill was
being considered in committee, and there was
full and ample consideration given to it.
The Minister of Finance explained, that he
had chosen three types of utilities, but
admitted that there was no particular logic
in his choice. When asked why he did not
include telephones, he merely said that he
did not choose to do so. That is the basis
for my asking that the bill be returned, to the
committee.
In the case of corporations producing electricity, gas and steam, the raites are controlled
either by the Board of Transport Commissioners or a public utilities board. In the
province of New Brunswick I think there is
a public utilities board, as I know there is in
Manitoba. In the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, control is, I believe, in the hands of
the Board of Transport Commissioners.
55708-28à

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In some cases it is a
municipal board.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Bell Telephone rates are
controlled throughout the provinces by the
Board of Transport Commissioners. But for
the sake of this discussion I shall regard all
companies as being under the control of a
public utilities board.
The man who sells groceries may charge
whatever prices he likes, but the man who
sells electricity is told what he can charge
for his product. That is the difference
between businesses.
As the honourable
senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchil) pointed out the other night, in order
that a telephone company may have a net
increase of fifty cents per telephone, the
governing body must allow that company to
increase its rates per phone by one dollar.
Half the increase goes to pay taxes. The
Minister of Finance was fair enough to
admit last evening that half of the taxes on
electric, gas and steam corporations go to the
province in which they are collected. It is
something like charity; the individual actually gives about fifty or sixty per cent of
the donation and the balance is made up of
the deduction which the government allows
him to make from his taxes.
But this does not apply to telephone companies. In their case the tax all goes to the
federal government. That is where the trouble
starts, and that is why these companies are
not included in this provision. If the provinces received half of the tax received from
the telephone companies, there would be
more inclination to give them the benefits
of exemption. I am strongly of the opinion
that we should not do anything to increase
our general taxes by raising the cost of
utility services, and this is one place where
rates could well be reduced. The Minister
of Finance in his remarks last night indicated
that he had allowed, these -concessions not
very graciously, but under pressure of public
demand.
I call the attention of the house to a
situation in the city of Winnipeg, where
we have two companies selling electricity.
One of them is city-owned and pays no tax;
the other is privately owned and is taxed.
In the province of Ontario the company that
produces the electricity pays no tax. In
Quebec the corporation producing electric
power has been paying taxes, and I am
told that is why the city of Montreal is
anxious to take over the operation. In that
way it would get away from the federal
tax. If we allow tax exemption in one province, it seems to me only fair to allow it in
every province.

SENATE
I am not speaking in the interests of
Manitoba, because we own our own telephone
system. But in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, New Brunswick and Quebec-as in
Ontario-there are quite a few small private
telephone companies as well as the Bell
Telephone Company. I do not object to taxes
on companies which fix their own profits.
Take the case of a man who holds stock in,
say, the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
Company. He has to pay taxes, but the
company can raise its price to whatever the
world markets are prepared to pay; and
certainly prices are going up, because I
noticed that in 1951 the company made double
the profit it made in 1950. At the same time
taxes were doubled, so the net profit was no
greater. But the owners of the telephone
company in New Brunswick have to go
before a public utility board to obtain an
increase to provide for additional outlays
in wages, costs of construction and maintenance, and for every dollar thus required
of them they must get $2 in increased rates.
In the world today a bitter struggle is
going on between private enterprise and
socialism. Those who listened to the radio
at noon today heard the Prime Minister of
Great Britain tell how he is struggling with
the situation left by a government which
previously occupied office for five years. The
people over there are standing on a trap
door; they do not know when it will collapse.
In this country we challenge the theory that
a private company should pay taxes which
a public company does not have to pay. I
am not in favour of that kind of thing. I
believe in private enterprise. I may be
entirely wrong. But today I heard a very
great expert say in committee that the two
private enterprise countries, Canada and the
United States, produce more goods than all
the rest of the world.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Certainly they are going
ahead faster.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The records of Canada and
the United States are outstanding in history,
and private enterprise is the backbone of
their economy.
I stand for private enterprise, and I do not
believe we should handicap it by taxation
from which we exempt socialized enterprise,
which is what we are doing by this legislation.
I am not concerned whether a change will
cost much, because, to judge from the record
of last year, we can easily reduce expenditures sufficiently to take care of the amount
collected from these telephone companies.
Of course a telephone is a very useful and
important article. I happen to know of a
young married couple, living on the outskirts
of Toronto, who are almost frantic because
they cannot get this service. The wife is

unable to leave her young children, and
she cannot telephone for anything she needs.
The best she can do is to make out a list
in the morning and have her husband take
it with him to town. Telephones are absolutely essential to our modern civilization.
I do not believe that this tax should be
permitted. I am opposed to it, and I shall
ask the house to vote against it. I made a
similar motion in committee yesterday and
I know that I shall be
was defeated.
outvoted again today, but that makes no
difference to me. The principle is wrong.
I am wholeheartedly in favour of free
enterprise. My party, also, believes in it.
So I ask every honourable senator present
to stand up and declare whether he is for
free enterprise or against it.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, if the vote were on the issue of free
enterprise versus unfree enterprise, I think
we would be practically unanimous: all of us
are for free enterprise. But I am wondering
whether the situation is quite so simple as
that. My honourable friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) complains because public
utility corporations are exempted from taxation to which certain other enterprises of a
similar character are subject, and that situation does seem anomalous. But is not the
answer this: there are in our communities
certain undertakings which are naturally
public enterprises. A group of citizens decide
to go to the government to ask for the
franchise which is necessary before their corporation can carry on such a business as a
railway which crosses the public streets, a
telephone service which must use the public
streets, or a power-generating company which
must use a great natural resource and carry
its wires across public thoroughfares and
along the streets of our cities. All these,
surely, are very different from, say, the
manufacture of boots and shoes, which anybody can engage in. A natural monopoly in
which competition can play no effective part,
and which cannot be carried on until special
permission to levy rates has been obtained
from the government, is not of itself private
enterprise, even though private individuals
are carrying it on. It is private enterprise
carrying on a public enterprise. So when
the distinction is clearly drawn between what
is naturally private enterprise and what is
naturally public enterprise, the anomaly seems
to disappear; and it is rather illogical to tax
something which is a public enterprise, taking
the money out of one pocket to put it into
another. For example, the province of Ontario
has a great hydro-electric system. What is to
be gained by the province or the dominion
levying against that system taxes which by
the very nature of things will be added to

JUNE 11, 1952
the rates charged to the consumer? You take
money out of one pocket and put it in the
other. What difference does it make, whether
the rates are controlled by a board or
not? The fact is that the taxes placed upon
public enterprises of the kinds I have indicated
are paid by the consumers; so also are the
taxes on private enterprise.
If we are
charged, as I think we are, with the responsi'bility of supplying such public services as
power, telephones, post offices, schools, and a
thousand other things I might mention, I
believe we are obligated to provide them at
absolutely the lowest possible price. It is
not logical to take money from them and put
it into one pocket rather than into the other.
I do not entirely follow my friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) in his attack upon the
exemption of public services from public
taxation.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I had no idea that my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Haig) intended to make the motion
he did this afternoon, but following his
remarks I feel that I should say a few words
to clarify my position.
This discussion will serve some worth-while
purpose if it does nothing more than bring
to the attention of parliament a situation
which we have here in this country. As I
pointed out last Thursday, in some provinces
we have telephone companies serving the
public which do not pay any taxes into the
federal treasury, and in other provinces we
have other telephone companies which do. In
other words, the telephone users in some
provinces pay taxes and those in other
provinces do not. That is the situation with
which we are faced.
The
privately-owned
companies have
always borne their fair share of the corporation taxes of this nation, and when the country
found it necessary two years ago to impose
a further tax of 20 per cent to take care
of additional defence charges, the telephone
companies and public utility companies found
themselves unable to earn a rate of return on
their invested capital which would be sufficient to pay dividends to their shareholders
and at the same time pay the 20 per cent
additional tax. They therefore asked the
minister whether, under these circumstances
and in view of the inflationary tendencies
and the fact that they would be obliged to
ask for increased rates-in other words, to
ask the telephone users to pay more for the
use of telephones-some system could not be
worked out whereby enough money would
be allowed to remain in the treasuries of
these respective companies to permit them to
get by. To put it another way, could not

some formula be devised whereby these companies could be allowed to earn a fair return
on their capital before paying this extra
impost of 20 per cent? On that occasion the
minister advised that such a formula was not
feasible. The companies impressed upon
him the fact that it did not seem fair that
the telephone users of some provinces should
contribute to the national defence of this
country when the telephone users of other
provinces, like Manitoba, were not contributing one dollar for the same purpose. As I
say, the response of the minister was that
such a formula was not feasible, but that
the situation would be surveyed and something done the following year if possible.
Further representations were made to the
minister during the year, and when the budget was brought down a section was included
in the Income Tax Act, which we are discussing now, which gave to certain public utilities the very thing that had been asked for
but denied it to what I consider to be a bona
fide utility, the telephone business.
When addressing the house the other day
I asked that this section be amended so as
to include telephone companies. I followed
up that request last night in committee, and
put the case before the minister as strongly
as I could, but he replied that he would not
accept any amendment and that the section
must stand as it is.
Having put the case of the telephone users
of New Brunswick and of the other provinces which are served by privately-owned
companies as forcibly as I could, I do not
propose to go further. I am therefore sorry
that I cannot vote for the motion of my
honourable friend.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has made a rousing speech on behalf
of private enterprise. I agree with what he
has said in support of private enterprise,
but at the same time I have to be practical
and look at what the problem is that lies
before us. The problem we are dealing with
in section 25 of the Income Tax amendments
for this year does not involve a battle
between private enterprise and socialism or
state ownership. This section proposes to
give some measure of tax relief to gas,
electric and steam utilities, which under the
present law are subject to incorne tax.
The section in question deals only with
companies within the category of private
enterprises; companies that otherwise would
be subject to the going rate of corporate taxation in Canada at the present time. The
real question, therefore, is whether the circle
of utility companies subject to the going
rate of corporation taxes in Canada at the
present tirne should be narrowed or enlarged

SENATE
in the matter of the preference, if you want
to call it that, which is being extended by
this amendment. The circle drawn by section 25 includes electric, gas and steam
utilities, and it is provided that instead of a
corporate rate of 50 per cent, which is the
general corporate rate under our present
income tax laws, the going rate of tax in
relation to these companies shall be 43 per
cent in respect of the income they receive
from the sale of their product or commodity
to the public.
Why have telephone companies not been
included within the circle to which I have
referred?
To that question there is no
answer in logic, that because logically speaking the telephone companies fall within the
same general field as do the electric, gas and
steam utilities. Last night the minister himself agreed that he could give no logical
answer. He said that the only basis on which
he could justify including these other utilities
and excluding the telephone companies, was
that under the tax agreements with the
various provinces the Government of Canada
rebates 50 per cent of the revenue, which it
collects in the way of business tax from these
utilities. Since they were specially singled
out he used them as a basis.
The motion which was made last night,
for the tabling of the bill would, if carried,
have had the effect of preventing the bill
from becoming law. Now, the income tax
amendments this year are in the main
relieving, and although the individual rates
are not much lower, they are at any rate
somewhat lower, and looking at it in a practical way-for we have to be practical in
this matter-I am concerned, because if the
bill is not passed we shall be left with income
taxes at a higher rate than the rate which
the government bas said is necessary in order
to produce the revenue that it needs for this
year. Besides being, as I hope, a practical
sort of person, I have what I regard as a
workable philosophy, namely, that if some
person offers to give you something, even
though it is not as much as you had hoped to
get, you should grab it, and begin at once
asking for more. I have expressed that
philosophy in the Senate before, so it is not
new. For these reasons I am against any
move which would prevent the income tax
amendments of this year from coming into
force.
I agree as to what the minister stated last
night. I also agree with m.uch of what the
leader of the opposition said todiay, though
he got away from the question by rallying
the forces of private enterprise against those
of public ownership. But private enterprise
versus public ownership is not the issue here,
for publicly owned utilities are not involved,

since they do not pay income tax. Maybe they
should, but they do not. The issue is whether
we should bring telephone companies within
the provisions of the new section 75, which
would entitle them to a lower rate of taxation, or whether we should allow them to
fight stronger and harder for inclusion among
the other utility companies as beneficiaries
of this section. The main rate of reduction
would be about 7 per cent off the corporate
rate. In Ontario and Quebec it would be less
than that, about 5 per cent. Still, that is a
benefit to these utilities and may reflect
itself in lower rates.
As I say, we have to look upon this thing
in a practical way. Having expressed our
views and indicated with, we hope, some
logic, a condition that we think should be
corrected, it may be that the minister's ears
will tingle a bit and that he will feel within
himself a logical urge to take action ultimately in line with what has been suggested
here. But I am not prepared to subscribe to
the amendment which has been proposed
todiay, because I do not want to throw overboard all the benefits that the bill gives. I
know that if the bill is referred back to
committee, one of two things must happen.
Either the committee will have to amend the
new section 75 to include telephone conpanies-and that amendment would not be
accepted-or it would have to take the same
course of action that it already has taken,
and report the bill to the Senate without any
amendment. For these reasons I am opposed
to sending the bill back to committee. I am
opposed to that course also because it would
give us more work, and we already have a
lot to d'o.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have listened carefully to the remarks of
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
What is before us is a report of the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. I was not present
at the committee's meeting, but it would
appear that the bill was thoroughly considered. The committee bas reported the bill
without amendment, and unless new evidence
is to be produced or new circumstances have
arisen, I find it difficult to see why the bill,
which already bas been carefully considered
by the committee, should be referred back
for further consideration.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
spoke for a few minutes on the motion for
second reading of this bill, and I have not
changed my attitude at all in the meantime.
I was then critical of the discriminatory
features of the bill, and in that respect I agree
almost entirely with what bas been said by
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I was at the committee meeting last night

JUNE 11, 1952

when the Minister of Finance appeared, and
without being unduly critical I must admit
that I did not like his attitude or the manner
in which he disposed of the arguments of
the senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchil). The minister gave no reason for
the discrimination; he said he could not give
any logical reason for it. It is quite apparent
that no one could give any good reason why
there should be discrimination in this matter,
and I was not particularly convinced by the
very poor reason that was more or less reluctantly advanced in support of the section. So
my opinion is just as it was before.
I would feel disposed to support the amendment submitted by the leader of the opposition.
Ordinarily, though, I like to be
reasonably practical, and I am just wondering what he hopes to gain by sending the
bill back to committee. I have no objection
to our taking that course, but what is going
to happen if we do? The Minister of Finance
would probably appear again and be just as
-I
almost used the word "cynical", but
instead I shall sayHon. Mr. Crerar: Adamant.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Adamant, if you like. He
might say that he has every sympathy with
the position taken by the senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchil), but that he
is not going to change the view that he has
already expressed. We would probably just
go through the same debate that we had last
night and today, and arrive at the same
result. If my honourable friend will state
what he hopes to gain by sending the bill
back to committee, I may be inclined to vote
for his amendment.
Hon. Mr. Haig:
question-

If I may answer the

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I would remind the bouse that if the
honourable the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) speaks now he will close the
debate.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
before the leader of the opposition closes the
debate on his amendment, I should like to
say that I agree very largely with the point
that he raised, and I support the argument
advanced by the senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. BurchilW.
But the thought that occurs to me is this.
What is the practical value of sending this
bill back to committee? The senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), chairman of the
committee, expressed himself very clearly,
as he always does, on the position in which
the house stands in this matter. I think, as
does the senator from Northumberland, that
this new section 75 is discriminatory; but I

would hope that the Minister of Finance and
his advisors will take note of the discussion
that we have had here and perhaps next year
remove what does appear to be a discrimination. I do not know what my honourable
friend would gain by pressing his amendment to refer the bill back to the committee,
because when the committee reported back
to the house we should almost certainly have
before us the same report that we are considering at the present time.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators,
I wish to call attention to one thing which
has not been mentioned so far in the debate,
but which impressed me very much at last
night's meeting of the Committee on Banking and Commerce. During the discussion
a distinguished member of this house, a supporter of the government, who is not in his
seat at the moment, made a casual -remark
to the minister to this effect, "What if the
Senate amends this"? And the minister said,
"Well, I would not accept the amendment".
I believe that all honourable senators who
attended the meeting of the committee last
evening will agree that had the Minister said,
"If the Senate amends the bill, I will accept
it", every hand in the committee would have
been raised in support of the amendment.
To my mind, the decision which we have
to make here today is whether the Minister
of Finance or any minister of the government
should dictate the course of action to be
followed by members of the Senate. The
question which we should take into account
is not whether the Minister of Finance will
accept the amendment, but whether we in
our hearts think the amendment is proper.
Even the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) admitted that there was
no logic involved in the choice made by the
Minister on this particular piece of legislation. The Minister himself made clear last
evening that it was a hit-and-miss arrangement, and that there was no logic involved
in excluding the telephone companies from
the benefits that may result. I think we
should direct our attention to the merits of
the case rather than to the question of
whether or not the Minister of Finance will
or will not accept an amendment.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I always thought we in
this chamber represented the sober second
thought of parliament, and were free to
express our views and say .what we thought
was the proper course to follow. If we decide
that an amendment to the bill before us is
proper, then we should make it, and If the
Minister chooses to reject it, that is his privilege.

SENATE
I take this opportunity of putting before the
house the impressions that I gained when the
minister was before the committee last night.
Had he agreed not to oppose the suggested
Senate amendment, all the members of the
committee would have supported it; but when
he said that he would not accept it, the
senators wilted and the amendment was
defeated.
Hon. G. H. Barbour: Honourable senators, I
did not attend the meeting last evening, but
I have some thoughts on this subject.
Are the telephone companies in any different position than other corporations which
distribute dividends and pay taxes? The
Prince Edward Island Telephone Company,
for instance, recently got authority from the
utilities board to increase private telephone
rates from $3.10 a month to $3.70 a month.
I presume the increase was to take care of
additional taxes. For myself, when I am
away from home for a few months I do not
bother to have the telephone service disconnected, because there is a good deal of bother
about disconnecting and reconnecting it. I
have no doubt that in the various provinces
there are many rural telephone companies
which will not be affected by this proposed
change, for the reason that they are run
co-operatively.
Honourable senators know that within the
past year the Bell Telephone Company has
been allowed to increase its rates. That
company is now paying $2 a share on its
common stock, and I notice that the interest
rate is better than 5 per cent at the present
quotation. The New Brunswick Telephone
Company, of which my friend spoke, is pretty
much in the same position. Recently a stockbroker recommended that I buy some stock
in that company. It was then selling at $12.50
a share and paying a dividend of 60 cents
per share per year. It seems to me that,
if any change were made by which there
would be a reduction in taxation, the benefits
would go only to the shareholders and to
the company. I am quite sure that in the
case of the Prince Edward Island Telephone
Company the rate would not go back to the
figure of $3.10 a month.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Sure it would.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
wish particularly to congratulate the honourable lady senator from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis) on the remarks she bas made,
and to ask the leader on this side of the
bouse (Hon. Mr. Haig) not to press this
amendment to a vote. I think it would
serve no purpose, for it is quite evident
that the bouse bas not recovered from the
"wilt" that it suffered last night.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Question!

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, let
me say that the purpose of my amendient has
been accomplished.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) said something in committee last
night that I do not like, andi he repeated
it today. I do not believe that we should
stand still and accept a deal that represents
only half a loaf. Such an attitude may be
all right in the House of Commons, but it
will not do here. All we are obliged to do
is to decide what is right and what is wrong,
and vote accordingly. The senator knows, as
I know, that the income tax which we will
have to pay for 1952 will be higher than that
of last year.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No; you are wrong there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; in 1952 I will have to
pay an increase of tax over 1951.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will have to pay an additional 2 per cent for old age pensions.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Minister of Finance
admitted on the floor of the other house that
the individual would have to pay more taxes
this year than he bas paid before.
I want to express my admiration of the
remarks of the senators from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill), Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) and
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I believe that
if I called for a vote now, two and perhaps
three of them would support the amendment.
My honourable friend from Waterloo asked
me why I wished this bill to be referred back
to the committee. Well, I have found in
my political career that if I fight long enough
my demands will finally seep through the
d.ullest intellects, and I will get what I want.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You are telling me?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My point has been accom.
plished, and I will not ask for a division.
The proposed amendment was withdrawn.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the report of the Standing

Canada today. I was going to suggest-but
I would be considered too bold if I did sothat when rnoney is flot taken out frorn a
concern in dividends but is reinvested in the
business in such a way as to give more
employrnent in this country, some consideration should be given to this practice in the
forrn of tax relief. But what I arn going to
say will to a certain degree elirninate the
need for that suggestion. I think the Urne
has corne when we sbould entirely drop succession duties from our list of taxes. Not
only does every individual now pay taxes
so long as hie lives, but if at death hie leaves
some money ta bis children or employees or
others, the recipients have to pay income tax
on that rnoney frorn the minute it cornes
into their hands. For these reasons, I repeat
that 1 should like to see succession duties
dispensed witb altogether.
Sornebody may say, "Oh, but succession
duties are an important source of revenue."
By way of answering that I rnay say that at
this morning's meeting of the Finance Cornmittee-which I attended, aithougb I ar n ot
a member of the committee-there was
produced a statement or scheduie of revenues
received by the government frorn taxes, and it
showed that succession duties provîde the
smailest of ail tax revenues.
The present government bas tried and is
trying to correct injustices whicb occur from
time to time. Yesterday the senator from.
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchili) cited a
discrimination against telephone companies.
The leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) pointed
ta an instance in the city of Winnipeg wbere
a privately-owned. cornpany producing electricity was taxed, whiie a publicly-owned
institution in the sarne city and perforrning
the sarne function was not taxable. I believe
the fair thing to do is to tax ail corporations
on the sarne basîs, whether tbey are publicly
or privately owned. At the same tirne, let
us abolish succession duties.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the bonourable
gentleman wbether hie can give us any
assurance that if the federal government
decided to do away with succession duties
the provinces wouid not double their present
tax?
Han. Mr. Howard: It is possible that they
would. But tbe federal government might get
the provinces ta agree to stay out of the succession duty field.
Han. Mr. Dupuis: What authority have we
for believing that the federal governrnent
could induce the provinces to do that?
Hon. Mr. Howard: We have none.
As bonourabie senators know, the succession duty levy as it applies ta certain people
causes great hardship. Take, for Instance, a

family circle within which the father, mother,
father-in-iaw and rnother-in-iaw drop out af
the picture, ail within a five-year period. In
those circurnstances, under the Succession
Duty Act, there rnay be very complicated
resuits; whereas, if there were no such Act,
the younger generation would just carry on
the good wark of the parents.
Here is a further reasan for doing away
with the succession duty. While a man lives
hie continues to attend ta the payment of taxes
and duties levied against hirn. But wben hie
draps out of the picture, hie rnay leave a
widow wbo bas had no experience in business,
and children who are not aid enough ta look
after bier interests. She rnay find tbe batik
accounts tied up and the safety deposit box
locked. That kind af thing often presents
an impossible situation, and I think the law
is bad.
While I give the federai govertiment credit
for ail the good that it has done and tried
ta do-and we are ai liooking farward ta a
reduction in taxation-I want ta leave with
this bouse one thought, which I trust others
share with me. My thought is-and I strongiy
recammend-that the government get out of
the succession duties field, and try ta see if
the provinces also would agree to withdraw
frorn that field. At the same time, I firmiy
believe that corporations shouid 'be taxed
without discrimination as ta ownership.
Hon, W. Rupert Davies: Honourabie sen-ators, I wouid agree witb the senator frorn
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) Up ta a point,
but I cannat go aiong with him in the suggestion that this is the tirne ta take off
succession duties. At present mast corporations pay a tax of about 52J per cent, and
there is a ievy on dividends in the bands af
sharehoiders. It seems to me that this f orm of
double taxation is rnost severe. But those of
us who iistened the other day ta tbe Minister
of Health and We]fare rnust bave been impressed by bis staternent that after the expenditures on defence and social security bave
been provided for, oniy 17 per cent of the
national revenue is left ta run the country
with. Sa, rnuch as I, like every other rnember af this chamber, wouid like ta see taxation reduced, I do not think this is the time
ta rernove succession duties. I do feel, bowever, that wýhen we bave got weli ahead witb
our defence preparations, the government
shauld consider very seriously this rnaVter af
double-and at times alrnost trebie-taxation
on the same money.
Han. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
listened with rnuch interest ta the observations of aur coileagues from Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard) and Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies). I share the view of the former that

SENATE
it would be a very fine thing indeed if we
could sweep away succession duties and, I
might add, some other forms of taxation.
But I arn afraid ýthat in the days in which we
live the possibility of abolishing succession
duties is a very remote one. This tax is one
of those instruments, devised in comparatively recent years, by which an almost cornplete redistribution of much of the wealth
of the country is being carried out. This trend
is clearly manifest to any one who studies
the consequences of succession duties in
Great Britain over a considerable perîod, and
the effect in this country will ultimately be
the same. While I have a great deai of sympathy with -the point of view urged by our
colleague from Wellington, I arn not very
hopeful that his expectations wiil be realized.
But my reai purpose in rising to make
this littie contribution is to offer a suggestion
which, I think, can be advanced on a basis of
equity and fafrness. Today, if an indivîdual
leaves an estate of $49,000, that estate is
not taxable; if his neighbour passes on and
leaves an estate of $51,000, that is taxable.
As a matter of fact, in committee the other
day I was prepared to ask a question on
this point, but being a rather modest and
timid personSome Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
An Hon. Senator: Say it again!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -I did flot do so. But
why should not the law be changed so that
the first $50,000 of any estate is exempt from
succession duty?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It is.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I might interject that
in Quebec the exemption is only $15,000.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: 1 arn speakîng of the
Dominion Succession Duty Act. This proposai seems to me very f air and reasonable.
After ail, the burden of taxation has become
very heavy indeed. This morning the Finance Committee had before it some information as to the variety of taxes levied on the
Canadian people and what happens in many
instances as a resuit. I think the suggestion
1 put forward should be seriously considered
by the government, and by parliament, if
and when a new Succession Duty Act is
placed before us for consideration. It seems
to me eminentiy fair, reasonabie and just
that at least the first $50,000 of any estate
should be exempted from succession duty.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If a man dies leaving an
estate of $51,000, is the tax imposed on the
entire $51,000, while an estate of only $49,000
escapes ail tax?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I can assure my honourable friend that the whole $51,000 is taxed.
A testator might be disposed to keep that
fact in mind, and try so to manage his
affairs that his estate would not be more
than $49,000.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Perhaps I should say
something about the law on this subject. It
is true that an estate of an aggregate amount
of $50,000 is not taxed except-provinciaiiy
-in Ontario and Quebec. If in the aggregate the total estate exceeds $50,000, that
amount is taken into consideration in arrîving at the rate of the tax. But after the tax
is deducted, $50,000 is left. For exampie, if
an estate were of the value of $51,000 and
the tax amounted to two or three thousand
dollars, only $1,000 would be taken, and
the remaining $50,000 wouid be exempt and
available in full to the beneficiaries under
the wiii, or to the next-of-kin if there were
no wiii.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But why should not
$50,000 be left untaxed, and the duty applied
only to estates over $50,000?
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is that both federal and
provincial law?
Hon. Mr. Aseijine: That law applies to al
Canada excepting Ontario and Quebec,
where provincial as well as dominion succession duty is imposed. But in the other provinces $50,000 is not taxed.
Hon. W. D. Euler: This debate seems to,
have developed into a discussion of inequities or inequalities in the matter of taxation, and certainly there is plenty of room
for complaint. But as to relieving estates
from payment of succession duty, I amn quite
in agreement with the senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)-or is it Sherbrooke?
Hon. Mr. Howard: Either one is ail right!
Hon. Mr. Euler: On previous occasions in
another place I argued that where large
estates are bult up by reason o! the fact
that in a country like Canada there are so
many opportunities of making money, it is
only fair and reasonable that, when a person
dies leaving a fortune, some part of it shouid
be taken for :the use of the state which has
made it possible to earn the fortune. 1 have
not changed rny mind with regard to that,
but I do say it is utterly unf air and wrong
that an estate of $49,000 left by a man in
Ontario escapes scot-free, while his nextdoor neighbour's estate of $50,050 is taxed on
the whole amount.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.

JUNE 12, 1952
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is so in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Ross: You will have to speak to
the Ontario government about that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No; it is a federal law.
Now let me say a word about double taxation. When a corporation distributes dividends
it pays a very high tax, and the shareholders who receive the dividends are permitted to deduct only 10 per cent for tax
purposes. I submit that this is not enough,
that it is only partial relief from double taxation. Why, we even have treble taxation in
this country. A few years ago I brought up
this subject in connection with insurance
companies. Prior to that time an insurance
company paid a tax of 3 per cent on premium
income. There was no apparent reason for
this, because a company might have a large
premium income and make no profit at all.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Are you speaking of
life insurance companies?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am speaking of fire
insurance companies, but life insurance companies, also may make no profits from investment income. The government brought in a
bill by which the tax on premium income
was reduced from 3 to 2 per cent; but I
maintain that premium income should not be
taxed at all, because the theory of income
tax, as I understand it, is to tax profits. An
insurance company might make no profit at
all, yet because of having a premium income
of two or three million dollars, taxed at 2
per cent, would pay some $40,000 or $60,000
in taxes. When the government introduced

a corporation tax for these companies, that
meant double taxation for mutual companies
and treble taxation for privately-owned corporations. First, there is a 2 per cent tax on
the premium; and, secondly, a corporation
tax. When a dividend is distributed, the
individual shareholder pays the third tax.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And the succession duty
constitutes the fourth tax.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Al right, call it a quadruple tax. We debated a certain matter
yesterday, but no great attention seems to be
paid to any of the representations we made,
and for this I am sorry.
The motion was agreed to.

MOTION

Hon. Gustave Lacasse moved:
That, in the opinion of this house, the government issue. at jts earliest convenience, ail Oid Age
Secutrity and Family Allowance cheques printed in
the two officiai. languages of the country, irrespective of the province in whlch reside the beneficiaries. and that this urgent recommendation be
transmitted ta the proper authorities without any
delay, through the good offices of the goveroment
representatives in this chamber.
He said: Honourable senators, it is not
my intention to deliver a long, challenging
speech on bilingualism. Such a pronouncement may be expected from some honourable
members, but I shahl do nothing of the kind.
I intend to make only a brief statement to

explain and justify the motion I am sponsoring with the kind and generous co-operation
of my colleague from Manitoba, the honour-

able the junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Davis). I shaîl then leave the floor to
those who wish candidly and honesthy to
state their views on this-apparenthy-very
contentious matter.

I sometimes wonder why so often, if not
invariably, conflicts of opinion turn into dispînys of vicious hatred and thirst for revenge
among men, although mankind,
being
endowed with mind and reason, flatters itself
that it is superior to ail other mortal creatures. That is precisely why there are so
many family quarrels, internal revolutions,
civil wars, and bloody international clashes,
which at times change the course of history
and affect the very destiny of mankind. I
hope that this inoffensive motion will not
lead to any such result, even on a smahher

SENATE
had it not been that the English press of
Canada, in general, has consistently and systematically refrained from mentioning this
issue in its columns, as though it were loaded
with dynamite. In passing, let me remind
the distinguished knights of the Fourth
Estate that ignoring a problem is far from
solving it. Is it raising an explosive issue to
simply face facts and try in earnest to analyse
their causes and effects? In other words, is
it a sin to be realistic? More specifically, is it
dealing with dangerous material to study, as
circumstances warrant, the relations existing
between the two pioneer races of Canada?
After all is said and done, I do believe that
a tribunal of the Senate-which at the present
time is a more free and sober-minded house of
parliament than any on this continent, and
perhaps in Europe-is the most suitable to
discuss and pass judgment upon a matter of
this kind.
Here, in brief, are the facts. If I am not
mistaken, prior to January 1952 all government cheques were issued in one language
But nobody
only, the English language.
seemed to pay any attention to this. Then the
government first decided, for reasons still
unknown to me to issue cheques in English
and in French-bilingual cheques-to old age
security pensioners in the province of Quebec,
and in English only to the pensioners elsewhere in Canada, a practice that has been
adhered to ever since. No satisfactory statement has yet been made to explain this
extraordinary and most uncalled for discrimination, which deliberately ignores 25 per
cent of the French-speaking population of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The French-speaking
pensioners are able to cash their cheques, are
they not?
Hon. Mr. Lacasse: We pay taxes just as you
do; our boys are wearing the same uniform,
and facing the same dangers and the same
common foe as your boys, and we are entitled
to the same rights.
Since the largest part of this French-speaking group of 25 per cent happens to be located
in Ontario, is it not logical that one of that
province's representatives in parliament
should make it his duty to express the feelings
and interpret the legitimate views of his
French-speaking fellow citizens on the
subject?
It is not the purpose behind this motion
to provoke or challenge anyone-even my
good friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine)-but to find out the true reason why
the government ignored the basic principle
upon which confederation was patiently built.
Sir John A. Macdonald, the great leader of
the party to which my friend from Rosetown

belongs, once stated, "There is no superior
race in Canada. French-speaking Canadians
and English-speaking Canadians are equal
before the law and in the light of history."
Those are substantially the words used by
that statesman. Why then should the language of the French-speaking Canadians be
ostracized by his present heirs and successors
in office in the matter of the official cheques
of this confederated country of ours-and
this in spite of the precedents which the
same government and party has itself
created?
This astonishing example of inconsistency
was admitted recently by a member of the
government itself, when he stated spontaneously in Windsor on April 17, in the course
of an address delivered to a social club: "I
fail to understand why in a bilingual country
like ours, old age pension cheques are issued
in English only outside the province of
Quebec." Those were the exact words used
by the Minister of National Health and Welfare, and I never used clearer and more
emphatic terms on the subject myself. In
order to be fair to the honourable member
for Essex East, I must add that he was careful
enough to mention that he was expressing
only his own personal views.
The fact
remains that the minister's opinion corresponds exactly to the one I am now expressing
on behalf of such a large number of dissatisfied Canadians, among whom are many
English-speaking citizens, both in and out of
parliament.
So honourable senators will readily see that
there is no revolutionary motive behind this
resolution of ours. The millions of loyal
Canadians, whose sentiments we are fully
conscious of expressing, are not questioning
the good intention of the government-they
are simply asking the powers that be to
realize the failure of their experiment, the
general disappointment and dissatisfaction it
has created throughout the whole country,
and to revise their attitude accordingly, for
the sake of greater peace and contentment
among the two largest groups of our population, and also for the sake of economy.
Nobody will make me believe, in fact, that
the printing of two sets of cheques is costing
less than the printing of one. On the other
hand, I take into account the fact that government cheques are printed in large numbers at one time, and that it would be quite
a loss to discard all of a sudden a large
number of those which are already printed.
It is precisely with that in view that the
words "at its earliest convenience" have been
included in the motion. The motion is, therefore not an ultimatum, so to speak, but a
respectful request to the government to
remedy the situation as best it can. May we
hope that it will at last recognize that our

JUNE 16. 1952
position is sound, legitimate and reasonable?
That is aur whole wish and desire, as
expressed in this motion.
I shall add very littie to what I have
already said, since I covered the whole subject in a previous speech, at the beginning
of the present session, in the debate on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Tbrone. Anyone can read the account of my
remarks in the officiai report of the Debates
of the Senate, at page 72.
I must say, however, that I have flot been
as fortunate as my honourable friend from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vailla*ncourt), who some
time last year in this chamber expressed
the wish that senators' identification cards
be made bilingual, and whose, wish was
acquiesced in on the very next issue of those
cards. Almost four months ago I similarly
called the attention of the government ta
the unfair discrimination I have just mentioned, but in spite of the thousands of
requests the government has received since
from ail sections of Canada, nothing has
been dane sa far along the lines I then suggested. I hope that this time a littie more
attention will be paid to what is said in
this chamber.
Honourable senators, a beautiful symbal
of Canadian unity stands on one of the most
picturesque spots of Ontario. It i.s to, the
eternal credit of my province of adoption
that the illustrious Samuel de Champlain,
called "le pere de la Nouvelle France", for
ever lives in bronze on the marvellous shores
of Lake Simcoe, in the very heart of the most
English province of Canada. That imposing
statue, of gigantie proportions, is a monument
not only t-o the gloriaus memory of a great
explorer, but also ta the broadmindedness and
true patriotism of those who contributed ta
its erection; and particularly sa because, on
that statue there eternally shine two inscrption.s, one in English and one in French, confirming and perpetuating the noble endeavour
of the great statesman who -once made passible the everlasting union of two great races
on this Nor-th American continent. Let us
draw f rom that wonderful symbol the lofty
inspiration it canveys, and let us neyer miss
an occasion to reaffirmn our determination ta
live in peace and harmany, because of our
intelligent understanding of the elementary
rules of justice and fair-play in this great
and beloved Canada of ours.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Honourable senators, I
wish to make a motion relating ta the second
reading of Bull 0-11, which I am sponsoring,
but I do not know whether I should move it
now or after we have dealt with item No. 2
on today's Order Paper. I think perhaps I
had better make my motion now, and I
crave unanimous consent of the Senate for
it. The motion is:
That rule 119 be suspended so f ar as it relates to
Bill 0-11, entltled an Act to incorporate Ogdensburg
Bridge Authority.

The purpose of this motion is ta suspend
application of Rule 119 which requires one

SENATE
week's notice of the consideration of a private
bill by the committee to which it is referred.
I would ask for unanimous consent of the
Senate to this somewhat unusual procedure.
The motion was agreed to.
SECOND READING

Hon. A. C. Hardy moved the second reading of Bill 0-11, an Act to incorporate
Ogdensburg Bridge Authority.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
in itself self-explanatory. Briefly, it is a
bill to incorporate an authority to build a
bridge across the St. Lawrence River between
the city of Ogdensburg, in the State of New
York, and the town of Prescott, in the Province of Ontario.
I do not propose to follow the procedure
adopted in the Senate during the past few
years, of explaining legislation section by
section. I think it will suffice if I speak only
to the general principle of the measure, the
expediency and advisability of the construction of this bridge, and leave the details for
examination by the committee to which the
bill is referred.
I may say that the bill follows the form of
several similar measures which already have
been passed by the Parliament of Canada.
At least two of those measures which expired
by reason of the lapse of time, had to do with
a bridge at Ogdensburg; a third had to do
with the building of the Thousand Islands
Bridge at Ivy Lea, in the province of Ontario.
An authority to build this bridge, so far
as the State of New York is concerned, has
already been incorporated by the legislature
of that state. It follows very closely the form
of the Thousand Islands Bridge authority.
Two points in the bill will require careful
examination in committee, namely, the
power to expropriate lands and other property to carry on the construction, and the
vitally important provision concerning navigation. The bridge will span the St. Lawrence
River at the deep channel, but it is provided
that navigation will be protected in every
way. As to the expropriation of property
and compensation therefor, the bill provides
that compensation shall be made for any
property that may be expropriated, or for
damage caused in any way by the construction of either the bridge or its approaches.
Because of the low-lying banks on both sides
of the St. Lawrence River-which is about a
mile or a mile and a quarter across at the
particular point-the approaches on each
side will be quite extensive, and will extend
back probably a mile or two or even more.
The municipalities through which these

approaches will be built are fully protected,
as will be seen when the bill is examined in
detail.
Compensation had to be paid to the ferry
company at Ogdensburg for the very valuable franchise which had been granted to it
in perpetuity. This ferry has been operated
by at least three generations of the same
family. The delay in bringing this measure
before Parliament has been largely due to the
time consumed in making the necessary
arrangements with the owners of the franchise. The Legislature of the State of New
York insisted upon proper compensation in
this regard, and only within the past few
weeks has final settlement in an amount
between $450,000 and $500,000 been reached.
This matter was satisfactorily settled before
the New York Legislature issued the charter.
Navigation, as I have said, will be fully
protected in every way. The work of construction must be started within three years
after the approval of the plans submitted to
the Governor in Council. It is altogether
probable that the Board of Transport Commissioners will be delegated to deal not only
with the plans affecting navigation, but also
with toll rates and other matters of that kind.
I should like to say specifically that this is to
be a toll bridge.
The cost of the construction will be something in the order of $10 million. The work
will be financed from private funds to be
raised through bond issues and such other
securities as the authority made decide upon.
No part of the cost of the operation will be
paid out of public funds either from Canada
or New York State. Plans have already been
made with a large banking corporation to
look after the issue of these bonds. It is
notable that when the bonds and other obligations become paid up, that part of the bridge
extending over Canadian water and land will
be handed over at no cost to the Government
of Canada, and similarly, that part of the
bridge extending over the territory of the
United States will be handed over to the
State of New York.
As I have said, construction must begin
within a period of three years after the
approval of the plan. Needless to say, before
construction can begin there must be considerable exploration of both the approaches
and the bed of the river. When the Thousand
Islands Bridge was constructed it was built
on a. series of islands consisting almost
entirely of rock, and no engineering problem
was involved. In the present case, I believe,
very considerable tests and examinations of
the soil in the vicinity will be necessary.
The bill provides that the bridge shall be
built from a point in Ogdensburg to a point
in Prescott, or four or five miles easterly or

JUNE 16, 1952
westerly, the purpose being to give the
authority an opportunity to find what kind
of soil is best suited for the foundations.
So much for the bill. If the Senate will bear
with me for a moment I would like to say
a few words about the general situation in
that part of Eastern Ontario. There is an
old railroad bridge which was built on a 10w
level from Cornwall to the United States
side, and about twenty-five years ago, by Act
of parliament, it was converted into a vehicular bridge upon being fioored over. I think
it served fairly well. Whether it will be
abolished when the deep waterway is constructed is a question which I arn not competent to discuss, but I arn inclined to think
that it will be fiooded. Fifteen or sixteen
years ago the Thousand Islands Bridge was
built between Collins Landing, on the Amerncan side, and Ivy Lea, on the Canadian side.
It extends for eight miles, and about theequarters of it, or perhaps more, crosses a
series of islands which are connected by segThe spans which
ments of the bridge.
connect respectively with Canadian and
American sol -are both 10f ty suspension structures one hundred and fifty f eet above the
water. The bridge contemplated in this bill
will be at least as high. There are four other
bridges of different types connecting the
smaller islands, and a four-to-five-mile road
traversing Wellesley Island.
Until the two main bridges I have mentioned traffic was carried across the St.
Lawrence by ferries: one at Kingston-I amn
not sure whether it is running now or notone at Gananoque, one at Rockport-a matter
of a haif-an-hour run-one at Brockvilleabout a fifteen-minute run-and one at Prescott, taking ten or fifteen minutes and a
smaller ferry at Morrisburg. Ail these boats,
except the one at Ogdensburg, were frozen
up for from four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half
months each year. The effect on traffic since
the building of the Thousand Island Bridge
can be easily imagined. Winter traffic has
been going that way entirely from the
western side, and I suppose the so-called
Roosevelt Bridge-the old converted railway
bridge-has been getting its share too. Prescott is thirty-five miles from the Ivy Lea
Bridge on the west, and between forty-eight
and forty-nine miles fromn Cornwall on the
east. So this bridge will be about equidistant
between those two points.
I was rather astonished to discover how
much traffic is carried by the ferry between
Prescott and Ogdensburg. Here is a brief
suxnmary of the figures covering movements

trucks and passengers
of automobiles,
between the years 1948 and 1951:
Trucks Passengers
Autos
579,871

1,474
1950.......... * 80,587
678,653
87,206*
1951 ............
* (Including trucks)
This is a much larger volume of traffic than
I ever imagined existed between these two
points, as the population of Prescott is only
3,000, and of Ogdensburg a little over 15,000.
One great advantage of this bridge will
be its attraction to tourists. At the present
time Canada is somewhat worried about its
share of the tounist industry. The sponsors
of this bull have reports fromn engineers
indicating that in their experience a bridge
over navigable waters which replaces a ferry
will double traffic in the first year of its
existence.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shail this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hardy: I move that the bull be
referred to the Committee on Transport and
Communications, which is the body that
usually handles bills having to do with
bridges.
The motion was agreed to.
E.N.A. ACTS AMENDMENT <READJUSTMENT 0F REPRESENTATION IN
COMMONS) BILL
SECOND READ)ING
Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 331, an Act to amend
the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1951,
with respect to the Readjustment of Representation in the House of Commons.
He said: Honourable senators, it is proposed by this bill to amend the British
North America Act so as to place withîn it
a further rule applicable to the present
readjustment of representation in the House
of Commons, and to future ones as well. This
rule envisages the establishment of a "floor"
whereby the representation of any province
shaîl not f all by more than 15 per -cent at
any one readjustment; subject, however, to the
qualification that the rule shaîl not work in
such a manner that the representation of a
province with a smaller population shaîl be
greater than that of a province' with a larger

membership of the House of Commons by
one member, so that representation can be
given to the Mackenzie District, separate and
distinct f rom the Yukon.

SENATE
The insertion in section 51 of the British
North America Act of a rule establishing a
"floor" is not unusual in the history of representation in the House of Commons. There
have been other occasions when such rules
have been applied. Honourable senators may
recall the so-called one-twentieth rule which
existed up to 1946. This had the effect of
providing a floor which, during its operation,
affected the representation of the Maritimes
and Ontario. During the time the rule was
in force until 1915, when a new "floor" was
established, an unanticipated development of
the West had the result of decreasing Maritime representation in the House of Commons
from decade to decade. Therefore the onetwentieth rule did not adequately meet the
situation.
The problem today is the reverse, and concerns the great difference which would take
place in the representation of the prairie
provinces if the present rules in regard to
representation were to apply. It will have
to be decided whether it is desirable to follow
the strict rules, or whether it is desirable to
import into section 51 of the B.N.A. Act the
additional "floor" I have mentioned.
I think it is recognized that there is a considerable disparity of representation in the
various provinces. There are constituencies
with large populations and with small populations, and apparently this condition will
continue from census to census because of
peculiar situations and the desire to adhere
to other rules which would give representation of the kind that the House of Commons
feels should be given. It is a generally
accepted rule that the representation from
rural areas should be greater than a strict
counting of heads would indicate, but there
has been no agreement as to precisely how
much greater it should be. For this reason,
among others, it has been urged that the
province of Saskatchewan,
particularly,
should receive some temporary .consideration
in the matter of representation.
To achieve this end it seemed best to
present two bills, one to amend the British
North America Act, by substituting in section
51 the "floor" which has been suggested, and
one to carry out the rules which would then
apply to representation in the House of
Commons.
The bill before us provides for the existing
rules, in so far as they go. It also provides
the additional floor for any province which
qualifies according to the definition in rule
5 of section 1. The immediate result, after
the representation bill is passed, will be that
under these rules, if adopted, the Province of
Saskatchewan will have seventeen members
instead of fifteen. It is hoped that this will

be the only result, and that as time goes on
the western provinces will again increase in
population and command an even greater
representation.
I am certain that honourable senators are
unanimous in their recognition of the great
contribution the West has made to parliament
and to the national life of Canada as a whole.
It would be unfortunate if our parliamentary
representation were to fluctuate so greatly
that it would have to be changed from one
census to the next. For that reason, and
bearing in mind the fact that this principle
greatly resembles the "floors" which have
existed in the past in relation to the representation in the House of Commons, I would
ask for the second reading of this bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not proposed to go into the merits of the
readjustment of representation as outlined in
this legislation, but I should like to recall
some recent history. First of all I would
point out that this marks the first time that
the Parliament of Canada has ever been
asked to amend the British North America
Act. We are breaking new territory tonight.
It may be said that from time to time since
1867 amendments have been made to the
B.N.A. Act, but these have only been brought
about as a result of joint resolutions of the
Canadian Senate and of the House of Commons submitted to the Imperial Parliament
at Westminster. It so happens that the
Imperial Parliament never refused to ratify
these requested amendments. It seems that
in nearly every second or third session since
I have been a member of the Senate we have
had before us a resolution requesting the
Parliament at Westminster to pass legislation
amending the British North America Act; but,
frankly, I think that the method we are now
pursuing is the better one. However, I am
perturbed about one thing. It was raised
in the other place, and has been in my mind
for a considerable time. When the present
Prime Minister carne into office he let the
idea get abroad-I do not say he expressed
it in so many words-that one way in which
he would like to contribute to the development of Canada would be by obtaining for
parliament the right to amend our own constitution. With that aim I entirely agree, but
the difficulties of achieving it are very great.
A few years ago when the matter was
proposed I felt there would be tremendous
difficulty in putting through legislation on the
basis of which the parliament at Westminster
could pass an Act that would for ever confer
upon Canada the power to amend its own
constitution within the purview of the agreement arrived at between the dominion and
the provinces.
I do not need to tell this house that there
have been many conferences between the

JUNE 16. 1952
provinces and the dominion with the object
of reaching an understanding on the question
of amendments to the constitution. Maybe
I am pessimistic, but I do not think very much
progress has been made.

There is no doubt

that we have the power to amend our own
constitution as to -any matter that is strictly
within federal jurisdiction and could not by
any stretch of the imagination be considered a
provincial matter. In the other house a few
nights ago the First Minister said that under
the British North America Act, as amended
within the last four or five years, any province
has had the power to pass legislation dealing
with matters within provincial jurisdiction,
and he said he could see no reason why the
parliament of Canada should not have the
power to legislate on matters within its own
jurisdiction. I cannot take a very serious
objection to that stand.
But I am trying to look at the thing from
the point of view of history. If you will
pardon a personal reference, I may say
that within the last two or three years I have
read the history of Confederation pretty
thoroughly. A couple of weeks ago I
endeavoured to make a short address before
a Rotary Club in Ontario, and for that purpose
I looked into that history a little more closely.
In my study of the subject I have been
impressed by the tremendous amount of work
that the active promoters of Confederation
had to do between 1864 and 1867 in order
to draft a bill that was acceptable to the then
four provinces, narnely, Upper and Lower
Canada-now Ontario and Quebec-Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick. Prince Edward
Island and Newfoundland refused to come into
confederation at that time, and of course the
Northwest Territories and the Western Provinces were not incorporated until later on.
I think that legally we can pass this bill,
and that our powers will not be questioned
before the Supreme Court of Canada or any
other tribunal. Now, I am one of those who
would like to live long enough to see the
Parliament of Canada empowered to amend
our own constitution in every respect, but to
my mind parliament can only acquire that
power as the result of an agreement between
the dominion and the provinces. The senator
from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) when he spoke
tonight, brought this point to my mind. This
country, composed of two races, French and
English, is the best living example in the
world of how two distinct racial groups can
live together happily and prosperously. Our
history shows that in the past there have been
many political disputes, but all have been
settled to the general satisfaction.
I hope that many of us here will live long
enough to deal with a proposed means for

amending the British North America Act, not
only in relation to matters within the jurisdiction of the dominion, but in relation to ail
matters that concern us. Undoubtedly, certain fundamental provisions would have to
be embodied in the constitution-provisions
dealing with, for instance, language, with
religion, and with education. There are many
other matters that would have to be specifically provided for, but these three are very
important ones. The provisions respecting
them would have to be so clearly stated that
no province could have a shadow of a doubt
as to the protection of its rights. If parliament were empowered with enabling legislation unfair to Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
Alberta or British Columbia, I personally
would be very much affected, for Western
Canada is my country. Similarly, senators
from Ontario, or Quebec, or the Maritime
provinces, however desirous of having the
dominion made the paramount constitutional
power in this country, would naturally insist
upon the protection of fundamental rights
affecting the matters I have already mentioned
and many others.
In my view-some of you may not agree
with it-the test of any bill to give parliament full power to amend the British North
America Act is this, that it should be such
a bill as would have passed if there had
been no confederation. I have had men say
to me "Haig, you are a democrat, but why are
you in favour of an appointed Senate? Why
do you not seek to have a change made,
so that men and women may be elected to
the Senate by the people?" In reply I have
explained that the reason why we have an
appointed Senate is that it was a condition of
confederation. You can talk as much as you
like about it, but that is the simple fact. Without the provision that the Maritime provinces,
Ontario and Quebec would each have twentyfour senators, confederation would never
have been accomplished. On the whole
whether confederation was a legislative Act,
a compact or what have you, does not matter.
We as senators should not only protect the
rights of the provinces, but safeguard the
minorities in the provinces. In that way only
can we have a great, united and contented
country.
There is in the minds of some people the
thought that this measure is an attempt to
get power to pass legislation without the
consent of the provinces. For my part, I
do not think that such action as is now proposed should ever be regarded as a precedent.
For instance, to take an extrerne case, if
legislation were presented for the purpose of
placing the control of education in the hands
of the federal parliament, there would be an
outcry that it could not be done. But why
could not a government bring in such a

SENATE
proposal if it wanted to? Bear in mind that
there are many people in every province of
Canada who are aware of the ever-increasing
cost of education in this country. Expenditures for education are increasing so rapidly
and getting so out of hand that real estate
in Canada can scarcely bear the consequent
burden of taxation. True, last year we voted
$7 million to relieve the situation, but it was
distributed in such a way that there could
be no dispute about it.
By way of conclusion, although I will
vote for the bill, I want it clearly understood, in case an amendment to the British
North America Act is proposed in the future,
that I protested against setting a precedent
by the passage of the legislation now before
us. When this bill passes, as far as I am
concerned it will be "on division". Confederation contributed greatly to this country
when it provided for a second chamber to
protect minorities from being over-ridden
by the majority.
I would point out that under this legislation Ontario will have 85 members in the
House of Commons and Quebec will have
75-160 out of a total 263. True, Ontario
and Quebec have seldom if ever voted together on any question, but mark my words,
the minute a matter of business comes up
the 160 members from the central provinces
will vote on the same side. For instance,
if those of us from Manitoba and the other
western provinces were to attempt to block
the St. Lawrence seaway project, Ontario
and Quebec would fiatly say, "It doesn't
matter what the people of the West may
think, we are going to build the seaway."
Does anyone think for a moment that these
two central provinces would give up the
development of electrical power on the St.
Lawrence because someone from Manitoba
or Nova Scotia opposed it?
I do not want at this time to make any
concession which will in the slightest degree
bar me from raising a question when, if
ever, we come to the matter of amending
our own constitution. I do not intend to
raise any question on the grounds of religion
or language, but I believe that we cannever
have a great nation unless every part of
Canada feels that under our constitution
it is fully and amply protected. A government may be able to pass legislation which
is unpopular from a business standpoint,
but when it touches the great fundamentals
such as education, religion and language, it
touches the very heart of the people. We as
senators have a special responsibility to see
that our constitution is not amended in such
a way as to make the people in any part
of Canada feel in their hearts that they are
not getting a fair deal, one with the other.

I do not intend to vote against the bill. I
am glad to hear that something is being done
for the Province of Saskatchewan. I would
point out that that province is represented
on this side of the house by two-threeAn Hon. Senator: Keep it up.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -four, distinguished Conservative senators. I do not know how they
all got here, but it seems that the majority
of the Saskatchewan members here are
Conservatives, and this is the only body in
Canada today where that is the case. The
problems of Saskatchewan, a sister province
of Manitoba, are to a large extent the problems of Manitoba. We do not have the oil
resources of Alberta or the industries of
British Columbia; our population is made up
largely of honest farmers who are anxious
to make good in the Dominion of Canada.
I am confident that all of us, as senators,
regardless of where we come from, want
to feel that we are doing our share to make
this is a better country than it is now.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask a question of
my honourable friend? Am I to infer from
what he has said that it would be necessary
to have a conference with the provinces
before he would feel safe in having the Parliament of Canada adopt such legislation?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. I did not say that. I
say that I am sorry the government has
thought it necessary to pass this bill before
it proceeds with the redistribution bill. I am
not clear in my own mind whether this step
is legally necessary. I am, however, aware
of the change in conditions in the Province
of Saskatchewan, and what that province has
been through; and I am pleased that the honourable leader of the government pointed out
that the proposed reduction in the representation of that province has been changed
from five to three. I am not saying that there
should be a conference about such a situation.
I am most emphatic, however, in my attempt
to avoid being left open to criticism because
I failed to protest against the measure now
before us. Regardless of whether or not
there should be a conference, my position is
clear; I do not think there should be any
change in our constitution until all parts of
Canada have had an opportunity to express
themselves on it.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Even if it concerns this
parliament only?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, that is a very vexed
question.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I am just asking for
information.

Hon. Mr. Haig: When you start to give concessions you are on dangerous ground, for

JUNE 16, 1952
you are to some extent setting a precedent.
Only the other day, for the first time in 85
years, members of the press were allowed to
sit in at the hearings before the Divorce
Committee of this house. While there was
no legislation prohibiting their admission to
the committee room, the practice had been
built up and it became more or less a precedent. Well, some of us decided to change it.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: You did it when I was
away.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think we should
amend the British North America Act until
an opportunity has been given to all concerned to say whether or not they want such
a change. In this case negotiations are going
on and no agreement has been reached. While
I do not go so far as to insist on a conference,
I do not want an undesirable precedent to
be set.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: On the previous occasion
to which my honourable friend referred, when
the constitution was amended by way of
petition to the Government of the United
Kingdom, was a conference held, or was there
any action other than a resolution of parliament?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am very sorry to have
to admit that I sat here in this house and
voted for the resolution. At the time I
thought I should not do so, but I was not
then quite firmly in the saddle as leader of
our party, and I thought it better to go slowly.
However, I was a little uneasy.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In view of the remarks of
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) may I direct a question to the
honourable government leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson)? I realize that the legislation with
which we are dealing pertains to representation in the other house, and that it can
properly and rightly be said that senators
should not be too greatly exercised about or
interested in that subject. The fact remains,
however, that history is being made tonight,
and a realization of it should come home to
each and every one of us. We are about
to change a part of the British North America
Act; and there is a feeling, both within and
outside this chamber, that, while we are now
dealing directly with a matter affecting
federal powers, changes in other directions
may follow. One that has been mentioned
is the control of education. We know that
there is in this country an element possessed
of considerable driving force which is
determined to place education under the
federal authority for one purpose only-to
secure financial aid.
The Hon. the Speaker: I must remind the
honourable senator that he began his remarks
by saying that he had a question to direct
to the leader of the government. What he

has said is not a question, but a speech.
Although the honourable senator has the
right to make a speechHon. Mr. Reid: What is wrong with a
speech?
The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable
senator is making an address he will be
barred from speaking again on the same
motion.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have the privilege and
the right to speak; and when I ask a question
I can make some remarks by way of introduction.
The Hon. the Speaker: During the very few
minutes the honourable senator has spoken
I have not heard any question.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If His Honour will possess
his soul in patience, the question will come in
due course.
The Hon. the Speaker: I repeat that the
honourable senator must first put his question,
and he may then add a few words in support
of it. So far he has not stated his question,
although he has spoken for a few minutes.
This is a friendly notice that he will forfeit
the right to speak again on this matter.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will direct a question to
the leader, but I must say that I can never
get used to these rules; in one way or another
I transgress them, and then I am called to
order. I do not suppose there can be one
rule for one person and another rule for
someone else.
The Hon. the Speaker: I may repeat part
of what I have already said. If the honourable member wants to ask a question he
should first put his question, and if some
elaboration is necessary he may say a few
words about it, but he should not make a
speech or an address. As I have said, so
far the honourable senator has spoken for
some minutes without disclosing what he
is going to ask. If that practice were followed, there would be no limit to the length
of remarks connected with a question. That
is why I am warning the honourable senator
that if he continues he will have exhausted
his right to speak on this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will start all over again,
honourable senators, I will begin right at the
beginning, and you can wipe out all that
was said. I rise to ask my question in the
light of the remarks of the leader of the
opposition (Mr. Haig). It is this: Will the
present legislation be a precedent for future
legislation under the British North America
Act with respect to such matters as education?
That is the inquiry I had in mind, and the
remarks I made were quite applicable to it.
I said that in this country there are those
who have some doubt as to where we are

SENATE
going when we start to change the British
North America Act. When I get an answer
to my question, perhaps I can speak on it.
There is nothing I am more anxious to do
than to keep within the rules of this chamber:
it seems, unfortunately, that I transgress them
quite often. Afterwards, if I have the right
to do so, I shall speak.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am quite prepared
to answer the honourable senator's question.
I can do so, specifically, now, or I am prepared
to wait until the debate is over.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wanted to make a few
remarks. I want also to keep to the rules.
It was not I who raised this question of procedure; it was His Honour the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I speak a moment on a
question of privilege. I think the honourable
member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) is under a misapprehension, and I would
not have it supposed that there is something wrong with our rules. The rule in
this connection is that one honourable senator may put a question to another, as the
honourable senator from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) did in addressing questions
to me; and I can answer as many times as
I like, but a debate on such questions is not
allowed. The honourable government leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) may be asked a question,
and lie can deal with it when he closes the
debate. The honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) had better make
his speech, and when the leader of the government rises at the close of the debate the
honourable senator's questions could be put to
him. The honourable member should not
say he wants to ask a question, and then
make a speech.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is it not a fact that it has
been cutomary to -ask questions on a bill, and
that there is a bill now before the house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but the honourable
senator was making a speech, which he should
not have done. He can ask a question, but
he cannot precede it with an address.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Where do I stand now? Do
I continue?
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable senator has the right to speak now on the bill if
he wants to. I warned him that the remarks
he was making partook of the nature of an
address, and that if he continued be would
deprive himself of the right to speak on
this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Very well, I will finish my
remarks when the honourable leader of the
government closes the debate. I was saying
that history is being made tonight, with this
proposed change in the British North America
Act, and I pointed out that all over this country
there are people who would like to place

education under federal authority because
they desire to be relieved of a financial
problem. Every municipality, every educational body, every provincial government complains of the heavy burden of taxation which
education places on taxpayers, particularly
those who are landowners.
With regard to representation, I have
another question which the government leader
may care to answer when he closes the debate.
Certain provinces were allocated a definite
number of members. I believe that at confederation Prince Edward Island, for example,
was awarded six members, and that its representation can never fall below that figure.
I am wondering what the people of these
provinces would say if as a result of industrial developments their populations doubled
or trebled, and they found themselves
restricted by the British North America Act
to the same number of representatives allotted
to them at the time of confederation. I suppose a further change could be made in the
representation of these provinces. One cannot deny that a precedent is being created,
and as far as I can see there is nothing to
hinder any future government from changing
the representation of any province now that
Canada itself can amend the British North
America Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: An amendment would
have to be sanctioned by parliament.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We are not asking the provinces to make any change. We are amending
the British North America Act to ensure that
the representation of certain provinces will
not fall below 15 per cent at any one readjustment. It is a protection for certain provinces,
but we are not asking the provinces to sanction this. We are putting it through ourselves.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The provinces have
nothing to do with this; it concerns the federal
government alone.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But it affects the provinces plenty.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would point out that if we
take this action now no one can say what the
representation of any province will lie in the
future, because any federal government may
change the representation of any province at
any time from now on. That is why I say a
precedent is being established and history is
being made tonight. It is argued that it is
expedient to take this action at the present
time because one of the provinces has lost
considerable population, but we might as well
realize that whenever any similar situation
arises the goverrnent of the day may introduce legislation to remedy the situation. I
am not saying whether this is good or bad;
I am merely asking the government leader if
this will establish a precedent in the way of

JUNE il, 1952
enacting amendments te the Br-itish North
America Act in matters affecting provincial
rights.
Hou. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senatars,
1 ar n ot a lawyer, and I know littie about
constitutionai matters. My recollection is that
in. 1949 the Parliarnent of Canada passed a
resolution asking the Imperiai Parliarnent to
grant it the right to amend the B.N.A. Act
in matters essentially perta.ining ta Canada
as a whole, as distinguished from matters
coming within the jurisdiction of the provinces or affecting the rights of any classes in
the community. The Imperial Parliament
subsequently assented to tis resolution, and
at this tirne ail we are doing. is exercising auir
new right. The legisiation befare us simply
seeks ta pravide that the representation af
any province in the Hause of Commans shal
not fali by more than 15 per cent at any one
readjustment. This is a question which is
exclusively the concern of the dominion; it
bas notbing at ail ta do witb the provinces.
The provinces are only concerned with representatian in their awn legislatures, and tbey
have full contrai aver matters which came
under their jurisdictian.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Tis cancerns provincial
representation in the federal pariament. It
is not a provincial concern.
Hou. Mr. Beaubien: That is wbat I have
been. saying. The federal parliament has
power ta amend our constitution in lirnited
fields only-in relation ta things affecting
Canada as a wble-and therefore I do not
u.nderstand why fear has been expressed
that education and other similar subjects may
some day corne under federal jurisdiction.
At tis time we are merely asked te amend the
B.N.A. Act sa as ta prevent Saskatchewan from
losing five seats in the federal house, and ta
permit it to retain seventeen.
Hon. Mr. Davies: The bonourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) bas
asked the leader of the gavernment whether
this legislation, if passed, will act as a precedent. I do nat tink the leader of the
government is in a position ta answer this
question.
The government might change,
and he obviausly cannot say what any future
government rnay do. I would like is views
on this phase af the question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Hlonourable membersTh. Hon. th* Speaker: Honourable senators,
I must point out that once the bonourabie
leader of the gaverament (Hom. Mr. Robertson) closes the debate fio senator wil-1 have
the right ta speak an the second reading of
this bill.
Some Hon. Senalors: Proceed.
Hen. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have listened with great interest ta the
55708--29

debate on tis biil I amn not a constitutional.
authority, and I can only give *my understanding of the legisiation before the bouse.
Fîrst af ail, 1 must say that one point raised
by the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) seerns reasonable. He was the first ta
point out that this was precedent-making
legislation in that it marks the first occasion
on which the Parliament of Canada has been
asked ta amend the B.N.A. Act. He also said
it was hoped that in these uncertain times
some agreement wouid be reached as ta what
are purely federal matters and what are purely
provincial matters. He further stated that lie
wisbed it had not been considered necessary
ta amend the B.N.A. Act until these matters
of jurisdiction were finally decided upon.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Robertson: He dîd not say that
this subj ect did not properly corne within
tbe jurisdiction of the federai parliament.
I can also appreciate the concern sbown by
my coileague from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid), and I can understand why be asked
tbe specîfic question wbether I., in my officiai
capacity as government leader in this bouse,
couid give any indication wbetber tis bill
would 'be regarded as a precedent. And at
one stage be questianed whetber we were
atternpting ta, legislate in matters that are
peculiarly the responsibility of the provinces.
0f course, I do not for one moment admit
that the question of how many members
sbould compose the federal parliament is
within the jurisdiction of the provinces. 1
arn unable ta produce any signed agreement
by thie provinces giving parliament exclusive
jurisdiction in this matter, but the fact is
that since Confederation there have been
several occasions when the overali representatian in the House of Commons was
changed as a resuit ai resolutions passed by
bath bouses ai parliarnent, forwarded ta the
then authority, the parliament at Westminster, and there translated inta legisiatian;
and in none af those instances, so far as I
know, was the appravai af the provinces
asked for or given.
On the question oi wbetber aur action on
the bull before us might in future be considered a precedent, I cannot of course look
into the future and ioresee what kind af
legislation may be brougbt down by the present government or any other governrnent,
but I should suppose that no matter what
party bappened ta be lin office, it cauld not
succeed in gettfing parliament ta pass a bull
unless bots hum~es approved af it. That
applies te a measurm. te change tihe representation in tbe Hoime of Commons as well as
ta any other measure.
But my honourable friend asks whether
wbat we are doing might become a precedent

SENATE

for amendments of the British North America
Act in relation to matters that are purely
provincial. One way to answer that question
is to consider what would have happened if
the federal parliament had sought to have
amendments of that kind made in the past.
Under the procedure then followed, concurrent resolutions would have been passed by
both houses and forwarded to Westminster,
and if any province had objected that the
federal parliament was seeking to encroach
upon a matter of provincial rights, there
would presumably have been a reference to
the courts. Well, I take it that the courts
will be appealed to in future if any province
thinks that parliament is going beyond its
jurisdiction in amending the British North
America Act.
As honourable senators know, discussions
have been going on for some time on the
problem of how to set up machinery to amend
our own constitution in any respect, as and
when desired. There are a number of matters which it is commonly agreed are within
the sole jurisdiction of the provinces. On the
other hand, there are matters which I think
most people would agree are by their very
nature within the sole jurisdiction of the
federal parliament. My own view is that
representation in the House of Commons is
in that category. But there are certain borderline matters which are not clearly within the
jurisdiction either of parliament or the provincial legislatures, and it is conceivable that
as time goes on the courts may be called upon
to decide whether the federal or provincial
authority has the power to legislate in these
matters, as they arise. But I do not think
any provincial rights or responsibilities will
be endangered as a result of the power of
parliament to amend our constitution. After
all, the judgment of members of both houses
will be brought to bear upon any measure to
amend the constitution, as it was brought to
bear in the past upon concurrent resolutions
addressed to the parliament at Westminster.
Since 1867 there have been a few occasions
when this house has been called upon to
prevent an apparent attempt at encroachment
upon the rights of minorities, and should
provincial rights ever appear to be jeopardized by federal legislation they would, I
believe, be as fiercely defended here in the
future as they were in the past. I think,
honourable senators, that we need not regard
this bill as a dangerous precedent or as giving any cause for alarm.
As I mentioned earlier, what we are considering here is by no means the first floor
that bas been placed under representation in
the House of Commons. Reference was made

to the provision for a certain minimum number of representatives froin the province of
Prince Edward Island. The amendment which
specified that minimum did nothing more than
establish a floor. If by some stroke of fortune the population of Prince Edward Island
or of Nova, Scotia increased much more
rapidly than that of other parts of Canada, in
due course the representation of those provinces in the House of Commons would no
doubt be increased. The province of Nova
Scotia not so long ago had twenty-one members, and its population then was larger than
it is today. By reason of the rapid growth
of the population in the rest of Canada, it
became necessary to reduce the representation
of Nova Scotia until it now has twelve members. The one-twentieth rule was intended to
ease the severity of that sharp drop in Nova
Scotia's representation; but such was the
unanticipated growth of the West that the onetwentieth rule was not adequate to take care
of the situation. A decision was then made to
incorporate into the statutes of Canada the
principle that representation of any province
in the Commons would never drop below the
number of senators from that province. That
amendment was passed by the two houses of
parliament, and the Imperial Parliament put
it into legislative form.
What the future holds in matters of this
kind remains to be seen, but I am confident
that in the passage of a resolution, as in
the passage of legislation, the great safeguard
for all concerned is the prevailing sense of
justice and fair play which characterizes the
people of Canada as a whole, and which I
should like to feel is reflected by their representatives in both houses of parliament.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Do honourable senators feel that any purpose would be served by
having this measure sent to a committee of
the house?
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Third reading now.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Although I am anxious
to expedite this legislation, I think it would
be wise to allow third reading to stand until

SUSPENSION OF RULES
MOTION

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved:
That for the balance of the present session Rules
23, 24 and 63 be suspended in so far as they relate

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 210, an Act to provide

He said: As honourable senators are aware,
this is a motion that is moved at this stage

of the will of the majority.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
if the house is agreeable, I would ask that this
bill be placed on the Order Paper for second
reading later today; but as there is no urgency
about the bill I will not press for this. The
amendments have to do merely with the
salaries of members of the Canadian section
of the International Joint Commission, and
with one or two other details. Unless there
is some objection, I move that the bill be
placed on the Order Paper for second reading
later today.
The motion was agreed to, and the motion

TRADE MARKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. F. G. Bradley (Secretary of State):
Honourable senators, this bill revises and
consolidates the Unfair Competition Act of
1932, which as a matter of fact has been in
force since September 1 of that year, and
other statutory provisions relating to trade
marks, trade names, and acts of unfair competition. As the main subject dealt with is
trade marks, the short title provided for in
section 1 of the bill is "The Trade Marks
Act".
As many criticisms had been directed
against the provisions of the Unfair Competition Act, and their interpretation and application had given rise to much dissatisfaction,
in the fall of 1947 the then Secretary of State
entrusted to an advisory committee of experts
in this field of law the task of studying the
representations and suggestions already submitted, of securing further views from
organizations and individuals who might
appear to have an interest in the matter, and
of making recommendations for the drafting
of new legislation or, if deemed advisable, of
submitting a draft statute for consideration.
In addition to legal practitioners specializing
in, amongst other fields, the law of trade
marks, and officials administering the Unfair
Competition Act, the said committee includes
representatives of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce, and the Patent Institute of
Canada. More recently an official of the
Department of Justice has also taken part in
the work.

SENATE
At an early stage of the committee's work
questionnaires were distributed to and representations received from interested persons
and bodies in Canada, the United Kingdom
and the United States, including the Patent
Institute of Canada, the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce, the Board of Trade and the
City of Toronto, the Law Society of Upper
Canada, the United States Trade Marks Association, the Chartered Institute of Patent
Agents of the United Kingdom, and the Trade
Marks, Patents and Designs Federation of the
United Kingdom. Copies of the questionnaires
were distributed to their members by the
Canadian Manufacturers' Association, the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Patent
Institute of Canada, and the Association of
Canadian Advertisers. A questionnaire was
also published in the Canadian Bar Review
and in the Ontario Weekly Notes. Notice of
the activities of the committee was published
by the Journal of the Patent Office Society
of the United States, and mention of its work
and objects was made in the daily press of
Canada.
The committee has been in contact with
other departments of the Government of
Canada having an interest in some of the proposed provisions: namely, the Department of
Trade and 'Commerce, the Department of
National Revenue, and, more particularly, the
Department of Customs and Excise, and the
Department of Finance, as well as the Royal
Canadian Mounted
Police, the Statute
Revision Committee, and the Criminal Code
Revision Commission.
The committee has held an average of half
a dozen meetings every year over a period
of approximately four years. Between those
meetings special committees or individual
members of the committee did a considerable
amount of work and devoted considerable
time to the committee's task, and' a little
over a year ago the committee produced the
first printed draft of the bill, which it circulated amongst substantially the same
organizations and individuals as had received
the questionnaires, more particularly those
who had indicated an interest in the subject.
It also made copies available to others who
signified a -desire to receive them.
As a consequence, further representations
were received, either indicating general
approval of that first draft or containing
for
criticisms
and suggestions

The same treatment was

accorded to the later submissions as had
been accorded to those received by the committee upon the questionnaires cireulated by
it at the beginning of its work: that is, they
were carefully considered, and any sugges,tions that appeared to the committee to be

reasonable and helpful were adopted and
were incorporated in the committee's last
draft, which has become the bill now before
this house.
I hope that the foregoing will not give the
impression that we pretend to have produced
a bill which meets all views. On a branch of
the law which is of such a technical character and at the same time of such practical
importance to commerce, industry and the
legal profession, it is obviously impossible to
achieve unanimity of opinion upon all points
and proposals. It is for these very reasons
that it is intended to afford all concerned an
opportunity to give full consideration to and
make representations on this bill as introduced. The intention is, more precisely, to
have the special committee make the bill
available to interested organizations and persons, to consider any criticisms and suggestions that may be received in connection
therewith and, if necessary, to recommend
changes.
It is also intended to prepare
a detailed explanatory report, which it will
probably be found advantageous to print and
publish a few months hence. Such a report
might prove useful in the administration and
in the interpretation of new legislation if it
is adopted.
One precedent for this is the Goshen Report
on the 1938 legislation relating to trade marks
in the United Kingdom.
I should like now to summarize briefiy the
main changes that this bill will bring about
in the existing law. First, it will effect the
elimination of the arbitrary division of trade
marks into word marks and design marks
introduced by the Unfair Competition Act,
1932. Second, it will provide a more adequate definition of what constitutes a trade
mark in the light of modern commercial practice. Third, it will deal with the applicability
of trade marks to services in addition to
wares. Fourth, it will bring about a relaxation of the rigid rules applying to the assignment and licence of trade marks. Fifth, it
will result in a clarification of the principles
governing the ownership of trade marks in
Canada and the persons entitled to registration, including the right to file an application
for registration prior to commencing actual
use. Sixth, it will provide for publication
of trade mark applications and for opposition
procedure. Seventh, it will endeavour to
gather into one compendious whole the provisions contained in various statutes relating
to prohibitions against adoption and use of
marks and symbols such as those used by the
Boy Scouts, the insignia of the Armed Forces,
and university emblems.
I should like to add that special care has
also been taken to ensure that the provisions

MTME il, 1952
of the -bilil are lIn accord with Canada's obligations under the Convention of the Union
of Paris lor the Protection of Industrial
Property, inckding the London Amendments
of 1984, to winch Canada adhered, in 1951.
Hon. Mr. Reid: M-ay 1 ask whether it is
the intention of the -governxnent to proceed
with the bill this session. or to have it stand
over until next session?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I believe that some time ago I made a 5>tatement about this bill, and for the benefit of
thiose who were flot present then I will repeat
it. The goverrment does flot intend to proceed with the bill this session, but siaould the
Senate see lit to pass the motion for second
reading, I will move a reference to the
Committee on Banking and, Commerce. The
purpose of bringing the mueasure down at
this time is that it may lie studied by al
persons interested, and the plan is to reintroduce it next session and preceed with it
then.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Horiourable senators,
I would ask that this order, which. stands la

senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) will- explain the bill at that time,
and the interval wil give honourable menabers an opportunity te, study the measure.
COLD STORAGE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. John A. McDonald moved the second
read-ing of Bill 335, an Act te amend the Cold
Storage Act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
the gentleman from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) is standing a little tee far away
te be heard very well on our side o! the
chamber, and I would suggest that hée take
a seat in the front row, by the side of the
senator fromn Churchill, (Hon. Mr. Crerar>.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: He might get some
inspiration there.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I arn only tee glad te
act upon the suggestion.
Honourable senaters this bill contains three
suggested changes te the present Colci Storage Act.
The first two changes are te section 5 o! the
Act. Rt is proposed that the present subsection 5 be repealed, and the first change in
the new section 5 would give the Governor
in Council authority te increase from 30 per
cent te ffl per cent the subsidy on warehouse projects which are approved by the
cold storage engineers. The second change
in section 5 would authorize the Governor in
Couneil to pay these subsîdies as soon as the
buildings are compheted andi approved by the
cold storage engineers.
This is quite a
departure from what has been the practice
under the present legislation, whereby the
subsidies were paid in five instalments over
a !our-year period.
The only other suggested change is founci
in section 2 of the bill. This will allow the
Gevernor in Council te pay in full, as soon
as the legisiation is passed, the eutstandlng
instalments of subsidies that have become
payable under old contracts.
Honourable senators perhaps have studied
the -cold storage estimates shown on pages
108, 109, 110 and 111 of the main estimates
for the present fiscal year, and will have

SENATE
noticed that there is a surn of $446,066 to be
expended this year. The details for the
various provinces are given there. Since
these estimates were made up new applications have corne in, and the cost of granting
these, together with the surns needed te pay
the outstanding instalments due on oid contracts, will require the submission of supplementary estimates later in the session. In
round figures they will amount to about
$832,000. 1 arn mentioning this fact now
because the supplernentary estimates often
do not corne to us until the last day or so of
the session.
I have here a statement sbowing the
number of warebouses constructed, and the
expenditures by provinces, since the inception of the Act, in 1907. One senator-I think
it was the gentleman from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine)-said hie would be interested
in having this inforrnation, and I arn glad to
present it. It sbouid be kept in mmnd that
a number of provinces do not seem to have
benefited from the Act as much as others.
The reason is, of course, that grain, the main
food product of those provinces which have
flot used the Act extensively, requires beat
rather than cold storage for proper keeping
purposes.
I arn sure that ail who have had experience
in trying te see that perishable food products
are rnarketed in good condition and to the
greatest advantage of the consumer as well
as of the producer will agree witb me that
the Act bas been of very great assistance.
The reason for the suggested change is that
in the larger producing areas and sbippîng
centres there are stili to be found istances
of food being wasted because of 1ack of cold
storage facilities. The rninister, speaking in
the other place yesterday, gave as a furtber
reason for the proposed change his belief
that with the subsidy of an even one-third
the provinces rnigbt be encouraged to cooperate with the federal government in
making a contribution towards the building
and equipping of cold storage warebouses in
the primary producing areas.
The following table sets out the number of
warehouses and tbe subsidies received, by
provinces, since the inception of the Act in
1907.

It may seern that Nova Scetia has received
more than its fair share in subsidies, but in
this respect I would point eut that the refrigeration facilities serve our extensive fruit
producing areas in the Cornwallis and Annapolis valieys; in addition to providing storage
for eggs, pouitry and seme dairy products.
British Columbia, with bier large fruit district
of the Okanagan Valley is in sornewbat the
saine position as Nova Scotia.
This bill, honourable senators, does not
seem to be cornpiicated, and perhaps needs
no further explanation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I shouid like to ask
How

much money is likeiy te be required of the
increase in subsidy from 30 per cent to 33à

Hon. Mr. McDonald: In reply te the question of the honourable member frorn Rosetown, I rnay say that I tried te get some
estimate from tbe appropriate officiais of

no way of telling how many applications
for assistance in the construction of warebouses wiil be received. I understand tbat
from. year to year the requirements vary
greatly. For instance, in the year before last
tbe expenditure was in excess of $900,000,
whiie last year the total was $503,000.
According te the first estimates for this year,
the subsidies wiil total something like
$446,000. Assurning tbat the annual average
expenditure is about baîf a million dollars,
the increase in subsidies would amount to
about $26,000 or $25,000, but tbat is only
a very rough estimate.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I did net quite understand wbetber tbe amount of $832,000 was
by way of a suppiementary estimate, or
wbetber it inciuded. the $446,000.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I asked tbe officiais of
the departmnent bow they proposed to pay
tbe outstanding instairnents, if this bill were
passed. They repiied that tbey were planning on a suppiementary estirnate te take
care of that and tbe applications wbicb. have
corne in since tbe eariy estimates were made.
Tbe total suppiementaries, tbey tbougbt,
would amount te sometbing less than
$832,000.
Hon. Mr. ]Robertson: More than the first

INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY WATERS
TREATY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 333, an Act to amend
The International Boundary Waters Treaty
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act of
1911, as amended in 1914, provides, among
other things, that the salary of each Canadian member of the International Joint Commission shall not exceed $7,500, that the
salary of the secretary shall not exceed
$4,000, that the commission's expenses for
office accommodation, equipment and supplies
shall not exceed $6,000 per year, and that
the Governor-in-Council may appropriate
annually out of the Consolidated. Revenue
Fund an amount not exceeding $75,000 to
meet all the commission's expenses.
The purpose of the bill before us is to
increase the maximum of the salaries to be
paid to ýthe members of the Canadian section
of the commission, the chairman's salary not
to exceed $15,000 per year, and the salaries
of the other two Canadian members not to
exceed $10,000 each per year; to provide that

the secretary and all members of the commission's staff shal come under the provisions
of the Civil Service Act and that all expenses
of the commission, including salaries, the
cost of office accommodation, equi.pment and
supplies and one-half share of all reasonable
and necessary joint expenses incurred by the
commission under the terms of the treaty,
be paid out of monies appropriated by parliament each year. The amendment will authorize the Governor in Council to determine the
salaries of the Canadian members of the
commission from time to time, within the
limit of the new statutory ceiling.
As honourable senators may recall, the
International Joint Commission of Canada
and the United States was established pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the
treaty between the two countries which is
commonly known as the Boundary Waters
Treaty of 1909. This treaty was approved
by the Senate in 1911 when it passed the
International Boundary Waters Treaty Act,
to give it effect in Canada. According to
the terns of the treaty the two countries
agreed to establish and maintain an international joint commission composed -of six
members, three to be appointed by the United
States and three by Canada. The International Joint Commission is the instrument
used by the two governments to implement
the terms of that treaty, the purposes of
which are to prevent disputes arising between
Canada and the United States regarding the
use of boundary waters or the rights in
waters flowing across the international boundary; to settle all questions then pending
between the two countries involving the
rights, obligations and interests of either
country in relation to the other or to the citizens of the other along their common frontier, and to make provision for the adjustment
and settlement of all such questions or disputes that might arise in the future.
The commission's work in recent years has
grown both in importance and volume. This
has been due in great part to the unprecedented demand for the use of waters along
the international boundary for the development of hydro electric power, and a growing
appreciation of the benefits from these waters
for irrigation in both countries. Some of
these waters also present the problerm of
the need for flood control.
The Canadian members of the International
Joint Commission at the present time are
General A. G. L. McNaughton, Mr. George
Spence and Mr. J. Lucien Dansereau. These
commissioners are receiving today the sane
salaries that were fixed by the International
Boundary Waters Treaty Act in the year 1911.
Notwithstanding the increase in volume and

J#K1 17, 1952
importance of the work, the commission is
stili required ta operate under the statutory
limitation of $75,000 whieh was also fixed in
the year 1911. The main reason for seeking
ta increase these saïoies is thre additional1
work -and its increased, hnportance, as well as
the fact that a .salary which might have -been
appropriate in 1911 might; be considered inet
se apprepriate in 1952. 1 think honourable
senators will also agree that rather than
have a fixed statutory amount ta caver thre
cornmission's annual expenses, which by their
nature must mecessarily vary In importance
and volume from year to year, it would be
more appropriate te have these expenses
reviewed. by parliament each year, eand
provision made for them in the annual parliamnentary appropriations.
It is aise f elt that thre comnLnssion's staff,
apart from thre commissioners themselves,
should came under the provisions af thre
Civil Service Act with regard ta appointment
and remuneration. In a letter dated November 19, 1918, the then Deputy Minister af
Justice expressed thre opinion that such staff
nrem-bers were, in fact, subject ta thre proviStrictiy
-sions af the Civil Service Act.
speaking, therefore, it mighit not .be necessary
to en-act titis amendment regar-ding staff,
'but it is feit desirable ta do so in order ta
dispel any doubts that znay exist.
Mon. Mr. Daviee: May I ask the honourable
senýator whether, if this bill is passed, it wifl
authorize the immediate payment af $15 000
per annum ta the chairman, and $10.,0OO4 t'O
the other two commissioners, or is the purpose
of the bill merely ta establish maximum
.salaries?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: One purpose of the
'bill is ta increase thre maximum salaries of
thre Canadian section ai thre International Joint
Commission. I cannot .say whether the Gevernar in Coundil is empowered ta imrnediately
increase the salary of the Canadian chairman
ta $15,000, but perhaps I should paint out that

I should like ta ask. As a member of an
International body which gives its service

paid. 1 know that as the Act now stands

will not be able to make a very good showing in that province. Apparently it is not
too well liked in Saskatchewan, and it
appears that the sentiment in some other
provinces is similar. Honestly, though, I think
the protest that has been registered has not
been so much against any political party
as against the tremendous taxation. The
people are dissatisfied, and they hit the first
head that comes up. That is how it looks to
me.
I am willing to have this bill go to committee, though I personally feel a little uneasy
about the work of this commission. Maybe
it does an important work, but I am not sure
about it; I have always had the impression
that its activities were not of much
importance.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
knowing something of the good work that
this commission has done, I wish to say a
word about it. There may have been a time
when the commission had not much to
occupy its attention, but in late years it has
had to deal with a considerable number of
important problems. Its studies of matters in
connection with the St. Lawrence and eastern
waterways has been of great value to Canada.
In the West many meetings have been held
between the Canadian section and the United
States section of this international body.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is the work done by the
commissioners a full-time job now?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes, it is necessary that
they devote their full time to the work now.
Some mountain streams rise in the United
States and flow through Canada and back to
the States, and there are constant negotiations as to who should share these waters
and have the privilege of using them for
irrigation purposes. Treaties have been made,
and their words must be strictly adhered to.
People in the United States built reservoirs
and canals to accommodate the whole flow of
certain international streams, and it was only
through the work of the Canadian section of
the commission that we succeeded in securing our share of these waters and making
highly beneficial use of them for irrigating
the land.
At times in the past the personnel of the
Canadian section may have been weak in
comparison with that of the American section, for our great neighbour to the south
has always seen to it that its section was
composed of able members, assisted by a
battery of legal talent and all the secretarial
help needed. I feel that in these times we
need the present strong Canadian section,
which is able to uphold our rights and see

that we get our fair share of the use of
international streams.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I wish to endorse everything that has just
been said by my colleague from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw). At the moment we
in the province of New Brunswick are
intensely interested in the commission,
because it is endeavouring to find a way to
give us badly needed water power, which
we require as a source for electrical energy.
This very day a meeting is being held down
there in connection with this matter. In the
hope that the commission will be successful
in its work on our behalf, I am prepared to
vote to have the bill passed right now,
without any reference to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask what international waters there are in New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The St. John river, which
forms part of the boundary line between the
Province of New Brunswick and the State of
Maine.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, honourable senators,
I agree with my leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). And
I want to express my personal feeling of
dissatisfaction with the present Chairman of
the Canadian section of the commission. The
people of Canada, both in the East and West,
refused to accept him as their representative,
but apparently that fact does not prevent him
from being engaged on this commission and
having his salary raised to equal that of a
cabinet minister. I should like to see some
other person appointed as chairman, and I
think the people of Canada generally would
agree with me.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
perhaps I should say a word or two about
this bill. When I was first thinking of it
there ran through my mind the same thought
as occurred to the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), that it has been a long time
since this Act was last under consideration
in parliament. The explanation probably is
that, although the commission has been in
existence for many years, it so happened that
over a long period the questions which came
before it were in general relatively simple
and few. In recent years, however, they
have so increased in complexity and number
that the commissioners have to all intents and
purposes a full-time job.
I do not agree with the derogatory remarks
made by the senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) about the chairman of the board.
I have had some opportunities of discussing
with him in a personal way-not officially at
all-the work that is being done by the
Canadian section of the International Joint
Commission, and on one occasion he told me
he would like to have the opportunity of

JUNE 17. 1952
appearing at some time before a Senate
Committee and explaining the commission's
work in relation to international waterways
and the importance of this work to Canada.
So far there has not seemed to be an
opportune time to ask him to appear, but
should the Committee on Natural Resources
ever wish to hear about the commission's
work, I arn sure that he could tell a most
interesting story of investigations and studies
made in British Columbia, in the Prairie
Provinces-including those referred to by
the senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw)-and in other provinces. The commissioners are now to be entrusted with the
important duties having to, do with Canada's
part in the construction of the St. Lawrence
Seaway project. I think we are indeed fortunate i having as chairman of the Canadian

section of the commission a man of high
attainment, wide knowledge and prestige. He
is quite capable of putting forward Canada's
position on any of the questions which will
corne before the commission.

affirmed, the principles of the legislation
passed in 1889 and the subsequent legisiation which, followed in 1914, 1923 and so on
to 1935.
There has been some criticism. of the efficiency of the present legislation, and changes
have been reconunended for its ixnprovement.
The committee recommends a division of the
funictions of investigation and inquiry on
tbe one hand, and the appraisal of situations
and action on the other. In other words,
for the purpose of clarifying the work of the
various individuals concernied, it is recomrnended that two opposing functions be
handedi to different officiais, and I think this
will increase public confidence in the board.
Besides that, the report suggests additional
measures for strengthening the combines
legislation.
Honourable senators, were 1 to go over
this bill in detail, twenty-two pages of it, I
think you would be very tired by the time I
got through. Certainly I was tired by the
time I even rend It. But fortunately I see the
possibility of touching on just the high points
of legisiation. They are four in number. To
begin with, there is the division of the functions, to which 1 have referred, which is perhaps the most important feature of this
amending bill. Second there is the granting
of power to the courts to issue injunctions
preventing the continuance of operations
which are inimicable to the public interest;
third, the removal of the ceilings on fines,
which- ceilings now appear in both the Crimmnal Code and the Combines Investigation
Act; and fourth, the granting of power to the
combines investigation branch to investigate
monopolistic situations-that is to say, not
entirely to pursue offences, or of people who
have been guilty of offences, but rather to
investigate situations which in the opinion
of the director or the commission will lead
to offences or to conditions inimicable to
the public interest.
These are the fourý outstanding provisions
of the bill, and ail the rest of the voluminous detail, in which honourable senators may
lose themselves if they care to, is consequential upon these four amendments;, I might
even say that, granted the wisdom of the
four main amendments, most of the others are
inconsequential.
Now let me take up these main provisions
seriatim in the order in which I have mentioned them. The new seption 5 of the Act
appoints a Director of Investigation and
Research, at a salary to be fixed by Order in
Couricil.
The new section O provides for
the appointment o! one or more deputy

directors, although I amn informed that at
present there, is no intention of appointing
a deputy.
The new section 16, which is in Part II o!
the bill, provides:
There shall be a Commissicn to be known as the
Restrictive Trade Practices Commission conslsting
of not more than three members appolnted by the
Governor in CounciL

One of the members of the commission is
ta be chairman. Hle is to be the chief executive officer and to supervise the work of the
board. Any one of the members o! the
board can exercise ail the powers of a commissioner appointed under Part I of the
Inquiries Act. That is, he may hear evidence
and so on, but he will not have the power
to report. It is important to note that the
power to report is definitely restricted ta the
board. That means that when an inquiry or
investigation has been completed, and the
parties are ready to corne to a conclusion, the
matter will be referred to the entire board,
and the accused, persons and the director will
appear with their evidence, and the outcome
will be reported ta the minister.
Hon. Mr. Reid- May I ask a question at
thîs point?
Hon. Mr. Ro.buck: Yes, of course.
Hmn. Mr. Reîd: Is there any advantage
arising out o! the change o! title from "'commissioners"~ to "director"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, there is. The
change was necessary because under the
proposed mensure there is to be one person

there is also to be a commission. The superior
body is to be the commission, and its members are called commissioners. It is therefore necessary to adopt the titie of "Director
of Investigation and Research."
Mon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable

it is used in the bull?

which were not required when the function
was entrusted to one individual. In the first
place, an investigation may be commenced
either by the action of six individuals who
may make and lodge a complaint, supported
by affidavit, or by the director on his own
initiative-that, by the way, is the origin of
most of the investigations-or by the direction of any of the commissioners or of the
minister. When the Director of Investigations
commences his work, he has no statutory
powers. He may gather such information as
he can without the authority to seize books
or examine witnesses. His rights are defined
in section 7, as follows:
Any six persons, Canadian citizens, resident in
Canada, of the full age of twenty-one years, who
are of the opinion that an offence has been or is
being committed against section thirty-two or
thirty-four of this Act, or section four hundred and
ninety-eight or four hundred and ninety-eight A
of the Criminal Code, may apply to the Director
for an inquiry into such matter, and shall place
before the Director the evidence on which such
opinion is based.

The director will, as I have said, gather such
information as he can. If the result of his
inquiry is such as to cause him to decide to
go further, and he wishes to enter the
premises and require the production of books
or to hear sworn testimony, he must go to the
commission.

Every effort seems to have been

made in this legislation to avoid the giving of
arbitrary powers to the director, so the
commission remains the supervising authority
throughout. The director is the workman;
he is the policeman. He cannot enter the
premises any more than a constable can
without a search warrant; he cannot order
the production of books or documents without obtaining authority, as is required to be
done in the civil courts. He has to make an
ex parte application to a member of the commission, under the provisions of section 9,
which reads in part as follows:
. . . the Director may at any time in the course
of an inquiry, by notice in writing require any
person, and in the case of a corporation any officer
of such corporation, to make and render unto the
Director, within a time stated in such notice, or
from time to time, a written return under oath or
affirmation showing in detail such information
with respect to the business of the person named
in the notice as is by the notice required.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before the commission;
the commission presides when oral evidence
is heard.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if the director
gets his authority from the commission?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If my friend has in
mind the affidavit evidence, I would refer him
to subsection 2 of section 9 which reads:
The Director shall not issue a notice under subsection one unless, on the ex parte application of
the Director, a member of the Commission certifies, as such member may, that such notice may
be issued to the person or officer of a corporation
disclosed in the application.

There is a similar provision with respect
to oral evidence, but I cannot give you the
citation offhand. If the commissioner is of
the opinion that the evidence which he has
adduced so far warrants the making of allegations against the parties involved, he may
do so, of course. Under the supervision of
the commission he prepares a statement of
allegations. This statement usually has been,
and will be in the future, a comprehensive
statement of the evidence so far adduced,
and, probably, of the conclusions of the
director with regard to the legality of the
operations of the parties involved. Then
a time is stated for the hearing by the
board. After the hearing by the board of
the examination of the witnesses and the
argument on both sides-the director acting
in the capacity of prosecutor and the accused
persons appearing through their counselthe commission makes its report to the
minister, and the report must be made public
within thirty days thereafter. That, in a
very condensed and general way, is a statement of the procedure.
With regard to penalties: neither the commission, nor a member of it, nor the director,
can penalize anyone for contempt of court
or on any other grounds, except upon order
of a court on application made to it not less
than twenty-four hours after service upon
the parties affected.
A good deal of care has been exercised to
protect the public against arbitrary proceedings by this commission.

Crown as represented by the minister. In
all probability the commission has little
knowledge of the legal profession throughout
the dominion, while certainly the Department
of Justice is well-informed on this subject
and is, I think, the appropriate agency for
the purpose, since payment for the services
rendered must be made from the public
purse.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The provision is a very
common one.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think it is the only
way it is ever done.
Hon. Mr. Vien: It is usual in appointing
counsel to royal commissions or boards.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. As I was saying,

by the commission.

they could be imposed only upon
to a court.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What court is indicated?
The Supreme Court of a province?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. As I remember
the section, it would probably be the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What information would
it have on which to act?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That would depend, of
course, on the circumstances. For the most
part, penalties are applicable when a person
who is directed to do something refuses to
comply. It may be contempt of court, the
refusal to carry out an order of the court
properly made. The commission has no
power to impose penalties upon an individual
who refuses to follow its orders. It must
apply to the court if it wants to impose
penalties, and in that event, no doubt, it
would have to prove the facts. Just how it
would do that would depend upon the court
or the judgment of the sitting judge: it might
be by affidavit, though usually in these matters viva voce evidence is required. I cannot
answer the question with any authority,
though I can imagine what the situation
would be if one were applying to a court to
impose a penalty upon an individual for the
breach of a statute. On any specific occasion
counsel would have to decide how to proceed.

Hon. Mr. Vien: In reply to the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), may I point out that the court in
question is the Exchequer Court, a superior
court or a county court.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes; thanks. I appreciate assistance of this kind, because the bill
has been in my hands for only a very short
time, and it is exceedingly voluminous and
difficult. The application will be, of course,
to the Exchequer Court. Officials invariably
choose that route when they can, but under
certain circumstances it is possible for them
to apply to the superior courts or the county
courts of the various provinces to enforce
their measures.
Hon. Mr. Vien: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? So far we have followed
his discussion of the organization-the director and the commission-and the procedure
to be followed. Is there anything in this bill
which changes the principle in virtue of
which the Combines Investigation Act was
enacted?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think there is. In a
general way I would say, no, but I would then
qualify my answer by adding that there is
an amendment to the Criminal Code, section
498A, and that the commission is given wider
powers to which I will refer in a few minutes.
To speak of fundamentals of the combines
legislation: there is the recent banning of
price maintenance, and a change whereby
discrimination against certain parties is
forbidden.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In this bill?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. It is narrowed,
not widened. But there is a considerable
widening of those provisions of the Criminal
Code which are part of this bill. Generally
speaking, however, the structure has not
been changed. The principal changes are in
administration: certain further powers have
been granted, such as that of injunction, that
of requiring production of affidavit evidence,
and perhaps some others, to which I will
refer.
May I return to what I was saying? Care
has been exercised by the drafters of this
bill to protect the public against arbitrary
action. I have acted for clients, accused
under the Criminal Code, whose books,
papers, documents and records have been
seized by the police and carted off. I have
seen great difficulties result from such action,
which at times seems to be exceedingly
arbitrary. No doubt that is why this bill
provides that these books and records must
be returned to the person being investigated
within sixty days after their seizure or voluntary surrender.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: While the honourable
gentleman is dealing with this section could
he tell us if this bill gives anybody the
authority to enter my premises, whether
I arn a suspected person or not, and take
away ail my documents, flot only copies
but the originals themselves?
Han. Mr. Raebuck:
There is certainly
authority to enter your premises.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Whether or not I arn
a suspected person? Does it give authority
to enter anybody's premises?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, 1 do not think so.
The director, if he wishes to enter your
premises and make a seizure, must first
appear before the commission and justify his
application by at least showing grounds for
suspicion.
Honourable senators will find
this provision set out in the Act; I cannot
give the section offhand; but I think the
answer is that neither the director nor any
representative authorized by hlm may enter
your premises and seize your books and
records.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The section in question is
to be found on the top of page 4. It is
section 10.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, the marginal note
is "Entry of premises", and the section reads:
Subject to subsection three, in any inquiry under
this Act the Director or any representative authorized by hlm may enter any premises on which the
Director believes there may be evidence relevant
to the matters being inquired into and may examine
any thing on the premises and may copy or take
away for further examination or copying any book,
paper, record or other document that in the
opinion cf the Director or his authorized representative, as the case may be, may afford such
evidence.

Hon. Mr. Aseijine: It is a pretty wide
power.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, it is wide; but, as
I have observed with pleasure, the documents and records have to be returned within a maximum of sixty days, whereas under
the Criminal Code they may be kept as long
as desîred.
Hon. Mr. Vien: As I understand it, the bill
does not provide for any change, and section
10 is based on the present sections 16, 17
and 36 of the Act now in force. This information appears in the explanatory notes
opposite page 4 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The examination of
premises and the carrying away of books
was always based on suspicion.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, but the authority to
enter premises where the director believes
there may be evidence relevant to the
matters being inquired into still remains,

and the obligation to return books and
records within sixty days is the same as at
present.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 10(1) is marked
as being new, or ail events rewritten. Honourable members will observe the black
mark at the left of the paragraph.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Unless I amn mistaken, there
is a new re-grouping of sections 16, 17 and
36.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is correct. There
is no' doubt about that. There is a provision
in the Canada Evidence Act to the effect
that a witness if he feels that the reply to
some question may incriminate hîm, may
say that he refuses to answer on those
grounds.
Nevertheless he is obligated to
answer. Under those circumstances, however,
the evidence may not be used against him
in any other proceeding, either criminal or
civil, with the single exception of one for
perjury in the giving of such evidence. My
experience has been that it is only when a
witness is protected by a well-informed and
vigilant counsel that this section is made
use of. On occasion, either through accident
or oversight, the "protection of the court",
as it is referred to in court parlance, is flot
claimed and made use of; so a great premium
is placed upon the knowledge of counsel. He
has to be on his toes, as it were, in relation
to the circumstances. Honourable senators
will find that in section 20 of the bill the
provisions of the Canada Evîdence Act are
read in, whether they are claimed or not. I
certainly approve of that.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Does the honourable senator
notice that this privilege appears to be limited
to criminal proceedings?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is it?
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I amn referring to section 20,
at the top of page 10.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It reads:
No person shaIl be excused from attending and
giving evidence
and producing books, papers,
records or other documents, in obedience te thIe
order of a member of the Commission, on the
ground that the oral evidence or documents required of hlm may tend to criminate him or subject
him to any proceeding or penalty, but no such
oral evidence so required shaîl be used or receivable againat such person in any criminal proceedings thereafter instituted againat him, other than a
prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence.

My memory may be at fault but I think
the Canada Evidence Act protects the use
of the evidence at any action. It certainly
does in the case of any criminal proceedings.
If it does protect against the use of the
evidence in civil proceedings, protection stili
may be claimed notwithstanding this paragraph; so nothing has been taken away, but
a great deal has been added.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I agree with my honourable friend to some extent, but we must
not forget that the Combines Investigation
Act is really part of the Criminal Code. The
authority of the Dominion Parliament to
enact the Combines Investigation Act in the
first instance has been upheld by the courts
on the ground that it is criminal legislation;
and while this Act itself does provide penalties, it provides for the most part simply a
prosecuting procedure, a policing procedure,
for carrying out enactments dealing with
And the most
certain criminal offences.
important criminal law which this Act
enforces is section 498 of the Criminal Code.
In our discussions on the revision of the
Code, in Bill H-8, a good deal has been said
on the point of whether certain provisions
now in the Code might not better be contained in special Acts, or whether all the
prohibitory provisions in other Acts might
not be included in the Code. At the present
time we are not taking either of these courses.
Hon. Mr. Vien: It seems to me that the
procedure we are following now makes it
difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to read
the Criminal Code intelligently. If you have
to search in this statute to find an amendment to the Criminal Code, that does not
make for facility in the intelligent interpretation of the Act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Unquestionably, some
difficulty presents itself there. It might have
been better had two bills been presented, one
having to do with Statute Law Amendment
Act; however, I do not think that much would
be gained in that way, as the subject matter
is being discussed in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But the two sections in
question refer exclusively to offences under
the Combines Investigation Act; therefore
they would appear more properly in that Act
than in the Criminal Code. They should be
removed from the Code. We should not
attempt to amend the Criminal Code by passing an amendment to the Combines Investigation Act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is a good deal
in what my friend has said, but that is not
the way we are proceeding.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Will these sections appear
in both the Criminal Code and this Act?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They will be in both
statutes. It must be borne in mind that this
provision has been in the Criminal Code since
it was first enacted in 1892.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Do you mean sections 498
and 498A?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 498 has been
in the Code since its enactment, but not section 498A. However, it is a matter of procedure, and I do not suppose I am called
upon at this time to defend the method which
has been adopted.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But we are dealing with
the Act now.
Hon. Mr. Hoebuck: Yes; but I can see no
great harm in the course that is being taken,
or no great advantage in any other course.
It must be remembered that we are now also
engaged in revising the Criminal Code; and
when it is re-enacted at the next session of
parliament, as it likely will be, section 498
will appear word for word as in the revision.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I note that the word "corporation" has been dropped in the new section. What about that?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: "Corporation" is left
out, but it is not to be supposed that a Judge
will close his eyes to the distinction between
an individual and a corporation when either
has been found guilty of an offence against
the Act. It was thought by the department
that a Judge should be left free to make the
penalty fit the crime. The principle is not
altogether one of law, but rather of Gilbert
and Sullivan, which is nevertheless pretty
sound.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is "corporation" included
in the word "person"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes; it is in the Interpretation Act.
The next point which I shall try to explain
to honourable senators is what the bill would
prohibit and why certain machinery is necessary to make its prohibition effective. I
refer now to section 498A which, as honourable senators will note, is largely new. It
reads as follows:
Every person engaged in trade, commerce or
industry is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term
not exceeding two years, who
(a) is a party or privy to, or assists in, any sale
that discriminates, to his knowledge, directly or
indirectly, against competitors of the purchaser, in
that any discount, rebate, allowance, price concession or other advantage, is granted to the purchaser over and above any discount, rebate, allowance, price concession or other advantage, available at the time of such sale to such competitors
in respect of a sale of goods of like quality and
quantity;
(b) engages in a policy of selling goods in any
area of Canada at prices lower than those exacted
by such seller elsewhere in Canada, having or
designed to have the effect of substantially lessening competition or eliminating a competitor in such
part of Canada;
(c) engages in a policy of selling goods at prices
unreasonably low, having or designed to have the
effect of substantially lessening competition or
eliminating a competitor.

JUNE 18. 1952
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is that the "lloss
leader"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No; "loss leader" has to
do with price maintenance. This section bas
to do with discrimiAnation as between coinpetitors. It prohibits the practice of selling
to one person, just because you like him, at
a lower price than you would to another, or
selling to a big operator at a lower rate than
you would seli to the littie fellow, provided
the quantity and quality are the same. Individual sales may be made under such circumstances, but sucb sales must flot amnount
to a practice.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask whether there
is anything in the bill whicb would prevent
a manufacturer from refusing to, seil to a
particular person? We all know of instances,
but it is difficuit to prove the fact.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The measure contains
nothing which would prevent a manufacturer
fromn choosing bis customers as he sees fit,
or from refusing to seil to a certain person
because he does flot like the colour of bis
hair, for instance, or for any other reason.
But as soon as two or more persons combine
to refuse to sehl to another, it is then they
commit an offence under section 498 of the
,Criminal Code. 1 grant you, that the law
does not cover ail cases o! hardship, but it
goes about as far as it is possible to go in
providing enforceable legisiation to probibit
combinations of that kind.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Do I understand the senator to say that when a manufacturer seils
to a chain of stores he is prohibited from
giving a greater discount than he does
when
he seils a smail quantity of goods to an
individual store?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Provided that the quantity and quality are the same, he must not
make a practice of discriminating in that
respect.
Han. Mr. Isnor: It is not a case of quantity
but of selling at a larger discount. What is
your answer to that question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Wben such discrimination amnounts to a practice it is-as I have
already said twice-prohibited. The pin-pose
of the prohibition is to prevent manufacturers or wholesalers fromn baving preferred
and unpreferred customers. For instance, a
vendor may agree to give a discount for cash,
but he must not make a practice o! giving a
bigger discount to a chain of stores than be

from discrimination of that kind, wbich bas
been so prevalent and so bard to meet.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Do I understand that
one manufacturer may discriminate in tbat
way, but that two cannot combine to do it?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. The Code provides that one must not discriminate in that
way.
I now turn to section 32 of tbe bill,
under the heading "Offences and Penalties,"
This section areads as follows:
(1) Every person who is a party or privy ta or
knowingly assists in the formation or operation of
a combine is guilty of an indictabie offence and
liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding two years.

And "combine" in the Combines Investigation
Act is defined thus:
"Comine" means a combination having relation
to any commodity which may be the subject of
trade or commerce, of two or more persons by way
of actuel or tacit contract, agreement or arrangement having or designed to have the effect of
<a) limiting facilities for transporting, producing,
manufacturing, supplying, storing or deallng, or
<b) preventing, limiting or lessening manufacture
or production, or
<c) fixing a common price or a resale price, or
a common rentai, or a common cost of storage or
transportation, or
(d) enhancing the price, rentai or cost of article,
rentai, storage or transportation, or
(e) preventing or lessenmng competition in, or
substantially controliing within any particular area
or district or generally, production, manufacture,
purchase, barter. sale, storage, transportation, insurance or supply, or
(f) otherwise restraining or injuring trade or

commerce.
That is a combination in restraint of trade,
and by tbe Combines Investigation Act it is
made a crime.
Section 34 contains certain provisions relating to procedure. I do not tbink we need
spend time on it.
Tben there are "Ispecial remedies" provided
in the bull. Tbey are new, and very important. By section 31, wbere anyone bas been
convicted o! an offence under section 32 or
34 of the blill, or under section 498 or 498A
o! the Criminal Code, tbe court may, on the
application o! the Attorney General of the
dominion or of any of the provinces, probibit
the continuation of the offence or tbe doing
of the act, or direct a dissolution of the
merger, trust or monopoly that bas been the
subject o! inquiry. Tbat is to say, for the
first time in Canlada, tbougb by no means
so across the international boundary, recourse
can be had to tbe courts for an injunction
prohibiting the continuance or tbe suspected
or feared commission of an act which is
inimical to the public interest.

manufacture or production". The question
was put to me whether an injunction could
issue against a labour union which by a
strike prevents, lessens or limits the manufacture of an article.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The answer is no.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 496 of the
Criminal Code states:
A conspiracy in restraint of trade is an agreement between two or more persons to do or procure to be done any unlawful act in restraint of
trade.

That is just the definition.
Then, 497:
The purposes of a trade union are not, by reason
merely that they are in restraint of trade, unlawful
within the meaning of the last preceding section.
There is a further provision with regard to

trade unions: section 498, subsection (2):
Nothing in this section shall be construed to
apply to combinations of workmen or employees
for their own reasonable protection as such workmen or employees.

That of course rules out prosecutions of
labour unions for combinations in restraint
of trade. It is an old provision; it has been
in the Code for many years.

Hon. Mr. Vien: Is there any provision that
covers the case of floor prices which would
have the effect of enhancing the price of a
because

it

is

evident

that

it

would fall below a certain point unless a
floor were established?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: By law? I am afraid
you cannot put a nation in jail; and if the

Parliament of Canada violates the principles
which it imposes upon its citizens, the answer

is an appeal to the public, to the voters.
Hon. Mr. Vien: And when there is a contract between an association of producers?

Take for instance the case of cheese manufac-

Hon. Mr. Vien: Why.

commodity,

Hon. Mr. Vien: When they prevent the sale
of margarine in any province?

It affects the price;

it raises the price of the commodity.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Such questions are
more easily asked than answered. I would
state definitely that there is such a provision.
One person of course cannot establish the
floor price for a commodity generally in the
market. He can legally set his own price;
but as soon as he combines with somebody
else to fix a floor price he violates section

498 of the Criminal Code. I think that such
action would clearly be a combination to
affect prices injuriously to the public and
to prevent competition.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Well, when the Minister of
Agriculture conspires with other ministers of

the Crown to buy all the butter offered for
sale below a certain price, is there a con-

turers, who from time to time enter into
contracts with a federal department with
respect to the selling price of that particular
commodity, said contracts having the effect of
fixing the price at or above the price named.
Is that tantamount to producing the same
effect as the bill seems to prohibit?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am afraid I am not
in a position to answer, because so far as

I know no case has been carried to the
courts wherein a government department
has been charged with a conspiracy. It has
long been customary and within the power
of the Governor in Council to make changes
in the customs tariff, I suppose by legislative
action, when it has been found that the tariff
is being used for combine purposes.
Section 29 of the bill gives the Governor
in Council the power to either reduce or
remove customs duties when it is made manifest that the benefits of the customs tariff

are being used improperly.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Does the honourable senator have the word "protection" in mind
when he uses the word "improperly"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck:

When a combine in

restraint of trade hides behind the protection

of the tariff wall, under this bill an order
in council may be passed changing the
statutory law in such a way as to remove the
customs tariff either in whole or in part.
Hon. Mr. Davies: What is the position of a
group of milk dealers in a municipality who
set a floor price on their product and refuse
to sell it below that price?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I rather think I ought

to say my office hours are from nine to five.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I could not answer that
question without investigating all the circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I should like to know why
section 498(3) does not apply to combinations of workmen and employees for their

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As the mere sponsor of
this bill I think my best answer is that "I

own reasonable protection as well as to a
combination of employers who are acting
for their own reasonable protection. Why
should this provision be an exception in the
case of the employee, and a rule in the case

refuse to answer on advice of counsel"!

of the employer?

spiracy that could be brought within the four
corners of this bill?

JUNE 18, 1952
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I certainly cannot say
authoritatively what actuated parliament to
pass this section many years ago, but I
imagine that if it were not for this section
the operation of trade unions would be impossible. I can also imagine that parliament
is influenced by the realization that trade
unions are necessary. Some say trade unions
are necessary evils; I think they have done
much to provide our working people with
economic advancement and freedom, and,
what is most important, to develop their
self-respect.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I hope the honourable
gentleman did not conclude from my remarks
that I am opposed to labour unions.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not, sir.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I was merely wondering
why a trade union would be protected when
a certain manufacturers association for
instance, would not be protected to the same
extent?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would say that.
According to the judgment of parliament
one is in the public interest and the other
is inimical to it. In any event, I do not feel
that I have to defend that principle now. It
is of long standing, and we are neither
changing the law nor extending it in any
way.
I turn now to section 42 of the bill. The
director, the minister or the commission may
cause an inquiry into conditions or practices
that are related to monopolistic situations or
restraint of trade. This power which is being
granted to the board is new. The director,
of course, makes the inquiry, but he may be
ordered to do so by either the commission or
the minister. This is in accordance with a
recommendation made by the MacQuarrie
Committee. It broadens the basis of inquiry
to cover not only offences which are now the
subject of inquiry, but situations which tend
to be injurious to trade.
The last section with which I wish to deal
is section 33. This section empowers the
court to require a person convicted of one of
these trade offences to supply information
from time to time or at a specific time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I should like to know how
many of these prosecutions have succeeded
from January lst, 1937, to January lst, 1952?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have not, of course,
got those figures. I could easily have secured
them if I had had notice of this question.
If honourable senators in their wisdom give
second reading to this bill, I shall move that
it be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, where the officials
can supply detailed information.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I have one other question.
I understood from the honourable member's
earlier remarks that this bill is the result of
recommendations made by the MacQuarrie
Committee. Apart from those recommendations, was there any other demand for this
type of legislation?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, I think so. I do not
speak with great authority, but I know that
the MacQuarrie Committee heard many
representations; and, naturally, any recommendation made to the committee had to be
submitted by somebody. The report stands
on its own feet, and to my mind it is a piece
of rather courageous thinking. I am not
passing on the wisdom of the recommendations, but whether we agree with them or not
we must admit the committee really have
performed a most useful service.
Honourable senators, in concluding my
remarks, I should like to say a kindly word
about Mr. McGregor, the former commissioner under the Combines Investigation Act,
and his successor, Mr. MacDonald. These
two industrious public officiais carried a
great load and have performed most difficult
duties. I can say this with some knowledge,
because in 1919 I was briefed by the provincial government of Ontario to conduct an
inquiry into the wholesale grocers' combines
in that province, and to prosecute them. I
know what the two men I have named have
had to go through, because for three years I
fought that combine. Strange to say, it
seemed that every man's hand was against
me when I was prosecuting those highly
respectable people.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How did you make out?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not any too weil, though
I broke up the combine. But the assistance
I got from courts and others left much to
be desired. I carried the matter to appeal in
the Supreme Court of Ontario, and in all
there were three solid years of battling over
the matter.
As I say, I know what these officials go
through, and I should like to express my
appreciation of their interest in and devotion
to their work, and of the services that they
render to the public. I wish the present
commissioner ail success in carrying out
the new Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMrrTEE

Hon. Mr. Vien: I take it that this bill was
referred to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. Honourable senators, I move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I inquire if there is
to be a public hearing on this bill?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That will have to be
decided by the Chairman of the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I understand that one large
body is eager to present a brief or at least
make an appearance before the committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
may I say a word just here? As pointed out
by the senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), it is for the committee, through
its chairman, to decide whether interested
parties will be heard. Some people are
desirous of appearing before the committee,
and in anticipation of a reference I suggested
to the honourable gentleman who in the
chairman's absence I thought might be acting
as chairman of the committee that consideration of this bill might be begun after the
Senate rises tomorrow afternoon. It would
not be feasible for the committee to take up
the bill tomorrow morning, because I have
undertaken to expedite as far as possible
the work of a special committee which
expects to have a large delegation appearing
before it at that time. The session is
approching its end, and it seems desirable
that the committee should begin consideration of this bill as soon as possible, namely,
tomorrow afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators,
people who want to appear before the
committee ought to be notified in time to get
here. This brings up a question which I
intend to raise right now. There is a good
deal of legislation yet to be dealt with,
and honourable members in another place are
apparently attempting to conclude their
work by the end of next week. I know that
the suggestion I am about to offer will make
me very unpopular with the senators from
Ontario and Quebec; but I do not mind, for
it will be favourably received by senators
from the other provinces.
I suggest that the Senate might condescend
to sit on Friday and Monday, and that the
Banking and Commerce Committee take up
this bill on Friday morning. In the meantime
notices could be sent out to interested parties.
The senators from Ontario and Quebec are I
admit, estimable citizens and very fine people,
but we do not see very much of them, nothing
like as much as we do of the senators from
Western and Eastern Canada. If the committee sits on Friday morning, we shall
have a chance to renew acquaintance with
our Ontario and Quebec colleagues. If the
meeting is called for Friday morning, there
will be time for my friend from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) to give notice
of the meeting to the people he has in

mind, and I shall be able to notify a party
who has communicated with me about the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My suggestion was
simply that the committee might begin consideration of the bill tomorrow afternoon, not
with any thaught of concluding work on it
then.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If our Order Paper
is cleared early to-morrow afternoon we may
have a short sitting of the Senate, and it
occurred to me that the committee could
initiate its study of this bill immediately
after the Senate rises. I have not made up
my mind .as to whether or not to recommend
that we sit on Friday. Tomorrow I intend
to enumerate the bills that are now before
us and those that we may expect to receive
before prorogation, and to be governed by
circumstances as they then appear. Bearing
in mind that some people orItimistically
inclined are hoping that prorogation may take
place at the end of next week, I wish to
make clear my desire to afford every facility
for the consideration of public business, and
if tomorrow it is evident that there will be
anything for us to do here on Friday afternoon I shall not hesitate to move that we sit
then.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I be permitted another
word? It is probable that by tomorrow afternoon, and almost certain that by Friday
morning, the Committee on Finance will have
its report ready. That report will be a very
important document. The committee has
done a tremendous amount of work-I say
that, not because I am a member of the committee-and if we are going to give the report
the careful consideration it deserves we ought
to spend a full afternoon in discussing it.
Whether what the committee bas done has
been good or bad is not for me to suggest,
but I can assure the house that the report
will contain a great deal of information of
much value not only to us but to the whole
country. In these circumstances I feel that
after to-morrow's sitting our next sitting
should be on Friday, or at the latest, Monday.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, may
I askHon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable members,
may I say just a word in defence of the
Ontario senators?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They need it.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Include the Quebec senators as well.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I will include the
Quebec senators. I see a number of senators

JUNE 18, 1952
from my own province of Ontario here at the
moment-the senator from Carleton (Hon.
Mr. Fogo), the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Bishop), the senator from Huron-Perth
(Hon. Mr. Golding), and the senator from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies).
Hon. Mr. Golding: We are here all the
time.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes. Our colleague
from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding) is
never absent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I say, a number of
my Ontario and Quebec colleagues are here
at the moment, and I think I express their
sentiments as well as my own when I say
that we are always willing to be present
whenever the leader of the government
thinks there is work for us to do. But it is
not possible to be here at all sittings, without
exception, and occasionally some senators
from Ontario and Quebec are absent. But
this is true of senators from the other provinces as well.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Most of those from
Manitoba are always here.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They are not here all
the time, though I will admit they are
present at most sittings. The leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) is certainly here
during a very large proportion of every session, and we appreciate that. I only wish
to add that if the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) desires to have the
house sit on Friday or Saturday, the senators
from Ontario and Quebec will be present.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CAPITAL REVISION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 308, an Act to revise the
capital structure of the Canadian National
Railway Company and to provide for certain
other financial matters.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the Senate, next sitting.
TREATY OF PEACE (JAPAN) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved second
reading of Bill 210, an Act to provide for
carrying into effect the Treaty of Peace
between Canada and Japan.

He said: Honourable senators, the basis for
this bill is the treaty of peace between Canada
and Japan. As honourable senators know,
that treaty was signed at San Francisco on
September 8 of last year, and in December
of the same year Canada approved it by a
resolution passed by both houses of parliament. Following this resolution, Canada's
instrument of ratification of the treaty was
deposited at Washington on April 17, 1952;
and by virtue of the deposit of a similar ratification by the United States the treaty came
into force on April 28, this year. It is perhaps worth while explaining that Canada's
so-called instrument of ratification was really
a note signed by our Minister of External
Affairs and sent to the Department of State
in Washington, reporting and confirming the
action of our parliament in approving the
treaty.
Article XXIII of the treaty required the
deposit of an instrument of ratification by a
majority of eleven countries, including the
United States of America, the principal
occupying power. It was arranged that the
instrument of ratification of the United States
should be withheld until at least five other
countries had ratified. In this way the time
of the coming into force of the treaty was
known in advance, and Canada's instrument
of ratification, which was in Washington on
April 17, assured that the application of the
treaty would date from April 28, 1952.
The peace treaty with Japan covers a wide
range of international interests, the majority
of which do not directly affect the laws of
Canada. The purpose of the bill before us
is to provide for the carrying out of certain
provisions of the treaty which may affect the
domestic laws of Canada. Therefore, any
pertinent discussion of the treaty as a whole
under this bill is limited by reason of its
narrow application.
The real substance of the bill is found in
section 3, which provides that implementation
of the treaty may be effected by order in
council.
The main purpose of the bill is to provide
for the settlement of property claims resulting from the recent Great War, and which
gave rise to many complex problems. The
bill follows the same form as the legislation
in connection with the peace treaties signed
in 1948, between Canada and Italy, Roumania,
Hungary and Finland.
The rights of Canadians who have claims
against Japanese nationals must be reconciled
with the possible recovery out of Japanese
enemy assets held in Canada and surrendered
to us under this treaty. This entails an
appraisal of the different classes of claims, the
amounts represented by each class, the
amount of funds held here, and the prospects

SENATE
of recovery in Japan. Under the treaty, rules
must be established regarding the identity of
Canadian nationals. In the matter of distribution of monies in the hands of the custodian, certain claims may not be immediately
classified; a claim for restitution may ultimately be treated as a case for compensation.
For these various reasons it cannot now be
indicated what provisions will ultimately have
to be made by order in council. Under the
circumstances, parliament is being asked, by
section 3 of the bill, to give the Governor in
Council power to act if and when it is
necessary to do so.
Section 4 of the bill gave rise to some discussion in the other house regarding the
powers to be given the Governor in Council
to impose penalties, but when it was learned,
that a similar bill was passed by the British
Parliament gave like powers to the British
cabinet, the objections to this section were
not pressed.
In conclusion I should like to say that the
consideration of this bill before the External
Affairs Committee of the other house was
made the occasion of an interesting and
thorough discussion on the treaty as a whole.
Many phases of the treaty were considered,
and much valuable information was supplied by such outstanding officials as Mr.
Norman, head of the Far Eastern Division of
the Department of External Affairs, Mr.
Erichsen-Brown of the Legal Branch of that
department, Mr. Wardroper of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, Dr.
Isbister of the Department of Trade and
Commerce, and Mr. Napier of the War
Claims Branch of the office of the Custodian
of Enemy Property, under the Department
of Secretary of State. Just last evening
I had an opportunity of reading the typed
report of the evidence given by these gentlemen during the sittings of that committee,
which were held on June 3, 5 and 10. I
regard it as most unfortunate that honourable senators-especially those who are
members of our committee on External Relations-did not have the benefit of hearing
what was said in those meetings.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: This was an opportunity for a joint meeting on a subject which
needs all the interest that can be aroused.
If my memory serves me right, when the
treaty was presented to the house last year
we all gathered the impression that we
would have an opportunity later of discussing it in its broader phases; but, as far as I
am now aware, the only opportunity which
we will have of examining the treaty as
a whole is within the narrow confines of

this bill. Honourable senators are at considerable disadvantage by reason of not
having heard the extensive information about
the treaty which was given to members of
the other place. I submit that the study of
this bill in the other house should have been
made the occasion for a joint meeting.
Possibly it is unfair to suggest that the
busy officials whose names I have mentioned
should be asked to repeat, within such a
short time, before our Committee on External
Relations the information they have already
given, but if the chamber sees fit to give this
bill second reading, I think it might be
referred to our External Relations Committee
so that one or two of the officials to whom
reference has been made could give us as
much information as possible about Japan's
position in the world at this time.
One matter of importance is the relation
of that country to Russia. There has been
no formal conclusion of the war between
Japan and Russia. What is going on between
those two countries? Japan has no agreements with the Peiping government in China,
but it has relations with the Nationalist government which is located in Formosa; it is
also engaged in negotiations with India,
which country was not a signatory of the
peace treaty that concluded the war with
Japan. These are questions which give rise
to some perplexity. We all realize the
importance of being at peace with Japan,
but we want to know as well what are the
implications of the treaty in relation to other
countries. Under this bill there is no opportunity of discussing these broad phases; and
the only excuse for referring the bill to committee is to enable us to enlighten ourselves,
as members of the House of Commons were
able to do, and so that we may approach the
whole question of our future relations with
Japan with some degree of intelligence.
One further aspect of this matter to which
I would refer is that of our trade relations
with Japan. Under the treaty of peace that
country is entitled to the reciprocal arrangement of favoured-nation treatment. Until
now she has been trading with us on the
basis of the highest rates of the general
tariff, but it is almost certain that she wifi
now expect from us the benefits of mostfavoured-nation rates. It is not generally
known that in 1951 Japan was Canada's
fourth largest market. We exported to that
country last year goods of the value of over
$80,000,000, of which $30,000,000 represented
wheat.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How did we get paid.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Canada may well look
forward to substantial sales to Japan of hard
wheat and hard wheat flour.

JUNE 18, 1952
I need do no more than make these general
references in connection with the treaty to
indicate the advantages of examining these
and other phases of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) did not hear
my remark. He tells us that we sold last year
$80,000,000 worth of goods to Japan.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In 1951 we exported
goods of the value of $80,000,000, and our
imports amounted to about one-fourth that
sum.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has Japan paid for
these exports?- How did Canada get paid?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The financing of that
trade was done largely from the two billion
dollars of relief which was allocated to
Japan by the United States.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not intend to discuss the general principle of the bill. Like
the honourable senator who bas just spoken,
I regret exceedingly that our Committee on
External Relations did not have an opportunity of discussing the subject-matter of the
treaty at the time when the committee in
the other place held its sittings. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on External
Relations has given us good service; he has
been diligent in attempting to arrange for
meetings. For the life of me I cannot understand why the committee in the other house
did not invite us to be present and listen to
the representations made before them.
Our main problem as a western nation is,
next to the European question, to understand
Far Eastern affairs. It will be remembered
that when the President of the United States
recalled General MacArthur, almost everybody in this country ranged himself on one
side or the other in the violent dispute which
followed. Who was right and who was wrong
I will not say, nor will I express my own
views. As a matter of fact I lack knowledge
of the whole eastern problem. I do not pretend to be well informed on Western
European questions, but I am sure that, like
every other Canadian, I know more about
them than I know of what is going on in the
Far East. Yet Canada is a Pacific power;
and certainly the people in the part of the
country I come from are extremely interested in Oriental trade, especially the sale of
grain and grain products. As a Canadian I
would like to know more about Japan.
I am interested in the subject for another
reason. In September 1939 this house voted
to go to war against Germany, and I remember what a solemn moment it was. Two years
later Germany attacked Russia. As Canadians
we had to decide what we would do in that
crisis. We determined, as did the United
55708-31

States and Great Britain, to help Russia.
None of us, I suppose, was too happy about
it, but we could not stand by and let Germany crush her eastern neighbour,-as in
my opinion, without the help afforded by the
West, she would certainly have done. So
we gave what assistance we could to Russia
to stave off the German attack until the
western powers were able to perfect their
organization, land on the European continent,
and conquer Hitler.
For many years we regarded the Japanese
as allies of Great Britain, with whom they
had always been very friendly. But we saw
this whole system break down. As Canadians
we cannot forget how both Germany and
Japan deliberately set out to conquer the
world. Yet we already have made peace
with Japan and are preparing to sign
a peace agreement with Germany in the near
future. I cannot see what other course we
could have taken, but twenty-five years from
now somebody may get up in this chamber
and say, "I wonder why those stupid fools in
the Senate ratified that peace treaty with
Japan back in 1952? Surely they must have
realized that such and such a thing would
happen". Well, we are aware that certain
things may happen all right, but we also
realize that we must do something. We have
to make a choice.
I feel that the government officials who
are familiar with the Treaty of Peace
between Canada and Japan should be summoned before our External Relations Committee to give evidence. There are many
matters upon which we should be informed
because there is no doubt that at the present
time conditions in the Far East are not conducive to the establishment of any permanent peace. Canada is spending, for a country of its size, vast sums of money on the
Colombo Plan in an effort to build up resistance against aggression in the Far East. Perhaps the strongest source of resistance against
this aggression is to be found in Japan
itself. I should like to know all the facts,
so that when we make our decision we shall
have full knowledge of what we are doing.
Like the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), I think it is most unfortunate that the members of this house were
not given the benefit of hearing what was
said on this bill in the meetings of the
External Affairs Committee of the House of
Commons. I have nothing to say about the
principle of the legislation, but I would
strongly urge that it be sent to our Standing
Committee on External Relations.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
agree with our senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) and with the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) that this bill should be referred to

SENATE
the Standing Committee on External Relations. As chairman of that committee I
have always endeavoured to arrange joint
meetings of members of both houses of parliament on questions of this importance, because I have always felt that it was useless
to duplicate work.
For some reason honourable senators did
not receive an invitation to sit in with the
members of the other house when its committee on External Affairs was dealing with
this bill; but we certainly have the right
to refer this legislation to our own committee on External Relations.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I rise to agree with the remarks made by
the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Lambert).
He said it was unfortunate that the members
of this house were not given an opportunity
to hear the representations made before the
House of Commons Committee on External
Affairs. I would go a little further, and say
that a definite discourtesy was shown to the
Senate in this matter.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I believe that when we
were discussing the Japanese Peace Treaty
a short time ago we were given to understand that the Minister of External Affairs
would appear before our External Relations
Committee to explain the various sections of
the measure; but this he never did.
Honourable senators generally receive
copies of the printed proceedings of the
various committees of the House of Commons,
but as yet I have received no copy of any
proceeding dealing with this legislation. The
only references I have found to this subject
appeared in Hansard of the other house only
the other day.
This is a most important piece of legislation, particularly as to the rehabilitation of
Japan and how it will affect our attitude
towards that country. When I was in Washington two weeks ago, in connection with
the activities of the International Pacific
Salmon Fisheries Commission, I met a delegation of American businessmen from the
Pacifie Coast. It may interest this house to
know that these men were in Washington
to do some lobbying on behalf of certain
interests, and they were protesting to the
United States Government about the importation of tuna fish from Japan. That marks the
beginning of a fight that will probably extend
to this country, because under the mostfavoured-nation clauses Japanese goods may
enter into this country free of duty. This
may mean that Canada will be faced with
the same situation with which now confronts
these American businessmen. The United

States has spent hundreds of millions of
dollars in an effort to rehabilitate Japan and
build her up.
The good faith of the Canadian businessmen is going to be tested before long when
goods from West Germany and Japan begin
flowing into this country. One reason is that
the Canadian manufacturer finds it difficult
to compete with his Japanese counterpart,
because Canadian labour receives higher
wages than Japanese labour. This is only one
aspect of the situation, and the bill before
us certainly needs a lot of explaining. It
provides for certain fines and terms of
imprisonment, but as a layman I am wondering just how these penalties can be applied
under this peace treaty. I have read the bill
through, and I am wondering whether this
legislation will enable the government to
carry out the terms of the peace treaty. I
think these questions should be answered
before we pass this bill.
I realize that the sooner we pass this bill
the sooner the treaty will take effect; but
it is no fault of the Senate that the matter
has been left to this late date. I certainly
feel that a joint committee of both houses
of parliament should have dealt with this
peace treaty, because there is nothing political
involved and it concerns the whole nation.
I trust the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) will see to it
that before this bill is passed by parliament
we shall have an opportunity to hear evidence
from the appropriate officials. I am not a
member of the Senate Committee on External
Affairs, but I am vitally interested in this
peace treaty, not only as a Canadian but as
one who comes from the Pacific Coast and has
had many dealings with the Japanese people.
I am familiar with conditions in that country,
and I think I know the effect that this treaty
will have on the economy of Canada once we
start trading with Japan.
Hon. Wisharl McL. Robertson: Honourable senators, I can assure the house that
the honourable chairman of the committee
on External Affairs (Hon. Mr. Gouin) has
always endeavoured to arrange meetings of
the two houses on matters of this kind. He
has done so in order to save the time of
witnesses and departmental and other officials.
I have frequently said that once a bill has
been introduced in the other house it may, if
the Senate so desires, be studied in one of our
committees in anticipation of its being
received here later on in the session. Now,
despite overtures made by our Committee on
External Relations, no great eagerness has
been shown by the corresponding committee
of the other houseto co-operate in the holding of joint meetings. And I must say that

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Before the
Orders f the Day are proceeded with I
propose to give honourable senators a brief
review of the legislative program which
faces us. It may have some bearing on our
future action.
I have no way not open to other honourable
senators of foretelling when prorogation, will
take place. The optimistic hope that it will
occur about the end of next week: others,
seasoned and more experienced in such
matters, have grave doubt about this, although
I suppose it is true of all of us that "hope
springs eternal". However that may be, as
far as I am concerned, and within the limit
of my powers, I shall work on the assumption
that all necessary time will be given to the
matters yet outstanding.
First let me refer to the business now
before the Senate or its committees. This
includes: the Combines Investigation bill, the
Treaty, the International
Canada-Japan
Boundaries Treaty bill, the Northwest
Territories bill, the Eastern Rocky Mountain Conservation bill, a bill to revise the
capital structure of the Canadian National
Railway Company, a bill to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act, and certain
concurrent resolutions, including the extradition treaty agreement. Another matter, not
in the foregoing classification, is the report of
the Finance Committee, whose recommendations, as honourable senators know, usually
require some time to debate.
Three other measures before our committees are the Trade Marks Bill, the Food
and Drugs Bill, and the bill respecting the
Criminal Law. With no desire to anticipate
or influence the actions of the committees in
respect of these bills, I may mention that it
is my understanding that none of them will
pass into law this session, although any or
all of them may be given some further consideration in the coming week.
Among the measures now before the other
place and likely to come before us soon is
the Redistribution Bill. Although I have no

JUNE 19, 1952
way of knowing what the attitude of honourable senators will be towards that measure, I have so much confidence in the government of which I am a member and in the
party which I support, that I believe the bill
will be a reasonable and fair one, and
that probably not much time will be
required to discuss it. I have not much
experience of bills of this kind and none at
all in the House of Commons, so I do not
know how long the discussion in the other
place will take; but I would think that when
the bill comes to us a reasonable attitude
towards it might be that "the King", in the
person of the House of Commons, "can do no
wrong". But that is for this house to decide.
Other pending legislation includes a bill
respecting allowances for Veterans and their
Dependents, a Veterans Dependents bill,
Veterans Insurance bill, Veterans Pension
bill, Civilian War Pensions Allowances bill,
Canadian Grain bill, Immigration bill, Army
Benevolent Fund bill, Marine and Aviation
War Risks Insurance bill, Tax Agreements
bill, Canadian National Railway Borrowing
bill, and another bill, which may not be
before the other house at the moment, in
respect of coinage and foreign exchange, the
resolution concerning which may have been
introduced today.
As far as the other house is concerned, I
understand that this afternoon it is engaged
on estimates and is likely to be similarly
employed tomorrow, so that as far as I know
further progress on legislation in the other
place is unlikely before early in the coming
week.
Without venturing to assess the relative
importance of this legislation, I would again
mention the bill respecting immigration,
which I had hoped to have introduced here but
which was initiated in the other place. That
bill was, I believe, reported today from
committee, and will be dealt with in the
other place early next week and come to us
somewhat later in the week. It is a rather
long measure, of considerable importance,
particularly to some of our members. Two
or three suggestions have occurred to me in
this connection. One is to wait until the bill
reaches us, and thereafter take whatever
time we see fit to consider it. The sections
got a good deal of attention in the committee,
which held a number of lengthy hearings.
Under ordinary circumstances, after second
reading of a bill of this kind I would move
its reference to the Committee on Immigration and Labour. But if honourable senators
feel that a formula can he adopted which
would be acceptable to his Honour the
Speaker, I would be willing to have the subject matter of this legislation referred to
committee in advance of the receipt of

the bill. I am in the hands of honourable
senators. I asked the chairman to ascertain
from some of her committee members
whether this would meet with their wishes.
If so I would be willing to facilitate this
procedure. The departmental officials could
appear tomorow, but the minister has said
that he will not be available until Monday.
If it is the wish of the committee to have the
minister appear early next week, I am prepared to -arrange for this. I cannot give any
better idea of when this legislation will reach
us, nor can I say what period will elapse
between that time and prorogation.
I have been advised by the Minister of
Finance that the bill dealing with currency
and related matters is largely technical in
nature, and that it makes provision for certain
stand-by powers relating to future foreign
exchange control. I have always been rather
wary about legislation of this kind, because
one of my first duties as government leader
was to handle a foreign exchange control
regulation. However, I do not think this
legislation is contentious, though my view, of
course, may not agree with that of others.
I do not know when this legislation will
come before the Senate, but the minister
has said that he intends to have it referred
to the House of Commons Committee on
Banking and Commerce before it comes to
us. I am prepared to ask that an invitation
be extended to the members of this house
to attend the meetings of that committee
when it is dealing with this legislation. I
realize that this idea is generally not acceptable to honourable senators, but I would
point out that yesterday some of them raised
the point that they had not been invited to
attend the meetings of the Committee on
External Affairs when it was dealing with
the Japanese Peace Treaty after the bill was
given second reading in the other place. On
the other hand, if that suggestion does not
meet with the approval of honourable senators,
I am prepared to facilitate the reference of
the subject matter of this legislation to the
Senate Committee on Banking and Commerce, and I shall do everything in my
power to see that honourable senators have
ample time to consider the measure when it
comes to them.
There is already a good deal of work
before our committees. The Standing Committee on External Relations is to meet tomorrow morning to consider Bill 210, an Act to
provide for carrying into effect the treaty
of peace between Canada and Japan. I
should like, if possible, to have the Banking
and Commerce Committee meet later In the
morning, as there is still a large amount of
legislation to be dealt with by this committee.

SENATE

I am going to move that this house sit
tomorrow and that it reassemble at 3 o'clock
on Monday afternoon, when I hope to have
one of my cabinet colleagues come to this
chamber to explain the Rocky Mountain
Conservation Bill. This measure is being
initiated in this house, and I want to facilitate
its passage to the House of Commons. I
can assure honourable senators that I have
done everything in my power to help bring
about early prorogation and at the same
time give honourable senators full opportunity to consider all legislation which may
come before them.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I have never been in favour of members of
this house attending committee meetings
of the other place. I do not believe in that
practice at all, and I do not think it is a
proper procedure. At the same time, I accept
with pleasure the proposal to bring the
Immigration Bill before our committee at
once, so that we can give it immediate consideration. I think this would also be a
good way to handle the legislation regarding
currency and related matters. I feel that
we were given a good insight into the Transport Bill last year, because we were given
every opportunity to go into the matter fully
in committee.
I am glad to learn that this house is to
sit tomorrow. It will give us just that much
more time to do our committee work. I am
a fairly regular attendant at our committee

meetings, and I find that when we are pushed
too much we are unable to give legislation
the consideration it deserves.
I am afraid that the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is rather optimistic
about the currency bill. It certainly can be
regarded as contentious if there is any question at all about it extending the power of
control over currency, and so on. I would
strongly urge that we get the bills on immigration and currency before our respective
standing committees as soon as possible, so
that we will have ample time to consider
thern there.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before the Orders of the
Day are called, may I direct a question to
the honourable leader? A few moments ago
he tabled a report on war claims. This matter
has been under study and investigation for a
considerable length of time. In view of the
number of Canadians who are awaiting
adjustment of their claims, I am wondering if
the leader has any information as to when
these claims will be considered?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is a very important question, and I would ask my honourable friend to be kind enough to put it in
writing so that I can send it to the officials

who are in a position to give him the information he desires.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I shall be pleased to do so.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CAPITAL REVISION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gordon B. Isnor moved the second
reading of Bill 308, an Act to revise the
capital structure of the Canadian National
Railway Company and to provide for certain
other financial matters.
He said: Honourable senators, when the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) was kind enough to ask me to move the
second reading of this bill, I was reminded of
the time many years ago when I bought my
five year old son his first mechanical railway.
From time to time we added links to the
tracks and various units to the other equipment, until the little railway grew to quite
a size. I do not know who was the more
interested in that, the father or the son.
Hon. Mr. Emmerson: It is generally the
father.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: My honourable friend says
it is generally the father. Well, as time went
by I found that my interest was taken over
by my son, who in turn bought a mechanical
train for his own son of five years. I watched
with fascination the way in which that train
grew from one or two passenger coaches to
a railway that included freight trains, locomotives, and finally diesel type engines hauling aluminum passenger coaches. I saw the
electric wiring installed, the signals arranged,
the switchboard setup, and the whole thing
operated as the Canadian National, Canadian
Pacific, or any other up-to-date railway system
is operated It was because of all that, perhaps, that I particularly welcome the opportunity which the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) was good enough to
give me when he suggested that I explain
this bill.
And my own liking for watching the movements of trains enables me to appreciate why
the present Minister of Transport, the Honourable Lionel Chevrier, is so deeply devoted
to his work. I recall what a fine impression
he made when he first came into the House
of Commons, in 1935. He attended to his
duties so faithfully and well that in 1943 he
was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to
the then Minister of Munitions and Supply,
the Right Honourable Mr. Howe; and in 1945,
he was made Minister of Transport. I think
he has done an exceptionally fine job in
handling bis portfolio. Some of us do not

SENATE
The Canadian National Railway Company
is year by year facing greater competition
from other modes of transportation. Today
airlines are catering to the demand for a
more speedy movement of some traffic, and
this has made considerable inroads into the
revenue of the Canadian National Railways.
Water carriers compete with the railways for
the transportation of bulk goods. The large
number of applications to parliament for the
construction of oil pipe-lines from western
to central Canada indicates that a new field
of competition will further reduce the
revenues of the Canadian National Railways.
Because of these and other factors, the government has felt that some action must be
taken.
Honourable senators will recall that the
Royal Commission on Transport, headed by
the Honourable W. F. A. Turgeon was set
up in 1948, and made its report in 1951.
That commission made some eight definite
recommendations, most of which were along
the lines of financial reconstruction of the
Canadian National system. The report of the
railway quotes the findings of the commission
in part as follows:
The Canadian National Railways has established
a case for reduction on its fixed charges and for the
desirability of the company being able to accurnulate out of earnings a reserve or something to come
and go on.

Following the report of the Commission, a
departmental committee was set up to study
the various recommendations made, and this
committee,

in turn, made a report to the

appropriate Minister of the government recommending that certain action be taken.
That action is embodied in the bill which we
now have before us.
Before proceeding to explain the bill, I
may say that I quite realize its importance.
As I have not had the legal training that many
of my colleagues have had, I hope the house
will bear with me as I explain in my simple
language the application of the several sections of the bill.
The Canadian National Railway system is
made up of four principal railways: The
Canadian National Railway Company has
absorbed by amalgamation the old Grand
Trunk system; it controls by stock ownership
the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk
Pacific system; it also has been entrusted
with the management and operation of the
Canadian government railways, which include
the Intercolonial Railway, the National Transcontinental Railway, the Newfoundland Railway and the Hudson Bay Railway. These
four principal railways, including their subsidiaries, are generally referred to under the
collective name of Canadian National Railways. Operations as a unified system commenced on January 1, 1923 and have

continued under different forms of management to the present day. At the present
time the management of the national system
is conducted by a board of directors appointed
by the governor in council.
The capital structure of the Canadian
National Railways has always presented a
problem to the government of the day, and
in 1937 parliament dealt with this problem
by enacting the Canadian National Railways
Capital Revision Act. That Act transferred
to a corporation called the Canadian National
Railways Securities Trust certain indebtedness of the national railways to His Majesty.
This had the effect of eliminating from the
balance sheet of the railways the old loans
for capital purposes and for deficits, together
with accrued interest thereon, amounting in
all to $1,218,642,195.
The Capital Revision Act, however, did
not deal with the large funded debt in the
hands of the public, and went no further
than I have indicated with respect to loans
made by the government to the national railways for capital purposes. Furthermore, the
Act of 1937 did not establish any policy for
future financing of the railways, except to
proceed along the well-worn path of borrowing either from the public or the government,
as the need arose.
In 1948 the government directed the Royal
Commission on Transportation to review the
capital structure of the Canadian National
Railway Company, and to report on the
advisability or otherwise of establishing and
maintaining the fixed charges of that company on a basis comparable to that of other
major railways in North America. The recommendations of the Royal Commission on the
recapitalization of the national system are
found in chapter 6, pages 196 to 198 of the
commissions report.
I propose to deal briefly with the recommendations of the commission and the corresponding provisions of the bill.
The Royal Commission recommended that
the fixed interest-bearing government loans
outstanding on December 31, 1949, totalling
$743,661,000, be converted into 3 per cent
income debentures on which interest would
be paid only if earned. The bill provides for
the writing off of an amount of $736,385,405,
being 50 per cent of the total indebtedness
of the national company to the government
and the public, outstanding as of December
31, 1951. In exchange for this release of
indebtedness the national company will issue
to the government an equivalent amount of
4 per cent preferred stock.
In addition to this relief from excessive
debt charges, the bill provides for a ten-year
moratorium on interest due on $100 million of
funded debt owing to the government.

JUNE 19, 1952

The royal commission in its first recommendation considered that 'as a temporary
measure the Canadian National Railways
should be reimbursed annually by the government for the operating losses of the Newfoundland Railway and steamship services,
'and also for capital expenditures in respect
thereof. I might say that the government did
not agree, but decided on another form of
assistance to which I will refer a little later.
However, the government recognizes that
the Sydney-Port aux Basques ferry is in a
somewhat different position, and proposes,
although this is not included in the bill, to
assume the operating deficits of that ferry
service. This will be done by submitting to
p'arliament each year an appropriation to
cover the operating ýdeficits of the ferry service, in line with the procedure adopted by
parliament in the case of the Prince Edward
Island car ferry. In 1951 the deficit of the
Sydney-Port aux Basques ferry was approximately one and a quarter million dollars.
In recommendations numbered 4, 5 and 6
the royal commission recommended that after
payment of interest due the public the Canadian National Railways be allowed to
accumulate out of earnings in each year a
reserve, or something to come and go on,
such reserve to be not more than the lesser
of, (a), one-third of the income after providing for all charges and deductions from
income except interest on the company's
obligations, or (b), the balance of the income
after payment of interest on debts due to the
public.
It appears that the real objective of the
commission was the establishment of the
principle that some portion of the annual
capital expenditures of the railway for additions and betterments should be financed
without adding to the fixed interest-bearing
debt of the railway.
Probably there are some -additions and
betterments required from year to year which
do not add greatly to the earning power of
the railway, and unless these can be financed,
in part at least, out of earnings or by equity
capital, there will be a constant increase in
the fixed interest-bearing debt of the railway
and perhaps a continuing tendency for annual
interest charges to rise beyond the railway's
earning capacity.
The bill provides for the annual purchase
by the government during the period 1952 to
1960 inclusive of additional 4 per cent preferred stock in an amount equivalent to 3
per cent of the railway's gross revenues, to
provide the company with a reserve to be
used for ordinary additions and betterments.
This percentage of gross revenue is a figure
which would be subject to review at the end

of 1960, in the light of circumstances existing
Any capital requirements

which could not be met out of this reserve
and other reserves of the railway should be
financed by interest-bearing loans either from
the public or the government. These are
matters in regard to which appropriate
decisions can only be made at the time
financing is required.
The royal commission recommended that
the shares of the Canadian National Railways
securities trust now held by the government
be turned over to the Canadian National Railways in exchange for an equal number of the
company's shares. The bill provides that this
be done and that the securities trust be continued for the purpose of protecting the
priority of government claims in respect of
collateral securities.
The commission's seventh recommendation was that any capital required to finance
the company, in addition to reserves accumulated from operations, be obtained from the
sale of bonds to the public and income debentures to the government. The government
felt that serious consequences might arise
from the adoption of this recommendation,
and did not approve it.
The commission recommended also that
surplus earnings, if any, after payment of
interest on debts due to the public, provision for reserves, or something to come and
go on, and payment of interest on government loans, should be dealt with at the discretion of the directors.
The bill provides that surplus earnings
remaining after the payment of interest on
funded debt, income taxes and dividends
on preferred stock, shall be remitted annually to the government; or the governor in
council may direct that the whole or any
part of the surplus remaining shall be applied
toward the discharge of the obligations of
the national system. If in any year railway
earnings are not sufficient to cover all expenses, including payment of interest on
funded debt, parliament will be asked to vote
the deficit.
The government considers that the provisions of the bill provide a generous solution to the problem of enabling the national
railways to finance capital expenditures without an undue accumulation of fixed interestbearing debt and annual fixed charges. If
these proposals are adopted, the national
railways would be relieved of fixed interest
charges on government loans amounting to
some $22,000,000, and in addition would have
a ten year moratorium on interest charges
on another $100 million. The railways would

SENATE
also be relieved of the burden of the operating loss in respect of the Sydney-Port aux
Basques ferry service.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
member who, then, will pay the loss?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
senator allow me to finish my remarks? All
things considered, I think the bill provides
an acceptable solution to the problem of
revising the capital structure of the Canadian National Railways.
In reply to the honourable senator's question as to who will pay the loss, I would say
that at the present time the Canadian government meets and pays all deficiencies in
connection with the Prince Edward Island
ferry. This was one of the conditions of
confederation. Upon this principle, the government will meet the operating expenses
and the deficit, if any, in connection with
the Sydney-Port aux Basques ferry service.
Perhaps, honourable senators, I should
apologize for having covered this bill so fully.
It is my first attempt to explain a measure
of this kind and of such importance. I felt
that I should endeavour to place the facts
on record so that those who so wish will
have the opportunity of studying the reasons
which I have placed before them as the outcome of rather a prolonged examination
since last evening, when the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) suggested
that I should deal with this matter.
In closing, I would point out that the bill
has four main purposes:
First, to release the Canadian National
Railway Company from certain claims of
Her Majesty the Queen in exchange for
preferred stock of the company.
Second, to release the Canadian National
Railway Company from certain other claims
by Her Majesty in exchange for an obligation
of the company, in respect of which interest
shall not be payable for a period of ten
years, commencing January 1, 1952.
Third, to from time to time purchase, out
of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, additional
preferred stock of the Canadian National
Railway Company to provide a portion of the
money required for additions and betterments
of the Canadian National Railway system.
Fourth, to transfer to the Canadian National
Railway Company all the shares of the
Canadian National Railway securities trust
that are held by the minister in exchange for
no par value shares of the Canadian National
Railway Company.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Does the honourable
senator know what the president of the
company, Mr. Donald Gordon, has to say

about these changes? This important bill
should be carefully considered in committee,
and perhaps Mr. Gordon should be present
at the hearings of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I understand that the
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) intends to refer
this bill to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. As to the honourable senator's question, I believe I have read
somewhere that Mr. Gordon has definitely
approved of the general provisions of the
bill and the reconstruction of the capital
structure of the company. I further understand, though I have no authority for saying
so, that the privately-owned Canadian Pacific
Railway Company is not altogether opposed
to the action contemplated under this bill.
One will be able to make a more intelligent
appraisal of the financial operations of the
two railway statements when the reports are
presented at the end of the year. I think I
can safely say that the president of the
Canadian National Railways approves of this
measure.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
having had some little experience about
twenty years ago with the Canadian National
Railway, I should like to make a few remarks
at this time. The capital structure of the
Canadian National Railway Company was
revised in 1937, and every time we have
made such a revision it seems that we are
taking money out of one pocket and putting
it into another. I am convinced that we
should have paid far more attention to
what was once said in the House of Commons
by the late Viscount Bennett, when, as a
private member he spoke for six hours in
opposition to the policy of his own party on
this railway question. Mr. Bennett-he was
not then a viscount-was a keen businessman,
but he was in the awkward position at that
time of being counsel for the C.P.R. and a
director of a bank which was a competitor
of another bank that was greatly interested
in the old Canadian Northern. I recall how
he urged that these railways be allowed to
go into the hands of the receiver. Had this
been done we would not have had these
revaluations and so on, and a certain bank
would have failed, and a family which left
millions of dollars would have been rendered
destitute. Mr. Bennett pointed out that 75
per cent of all railways in the United States
had fallen into the hands of receivers.
It always strikes me as strange that those
who criticize the socialist government of one
of our provinces are always the first to wax
eloquent over the Canadian National Railway
system, which is certainly rampant with
socialism.

JUNE 19, 1952
The people of Canada have paid dearly for
the operation of this company, and in the past
we have been unfortunate in the choice of
men who have headed this business. It would
probably serve no useful purpose for me
to give proof of what I say. Perhaps it is
sufficient to say that certain bronze tablets
which I see in railway stations across Canada
are enough to make me travel on the C.P.R.
The taxpayers of Canada were particularly
unfortunate when a certain president of the
C.N.R. went to New York and, without
authority from Ottawa, borrowed money for
the company. Although the men who loaned
this money were actually Canadians, they had
the option of receiving repayment in American
funds. We found ourselves in the position of
having to operate a railroad at a time when
our money was at a discount of 18 per cent
in the United States, and of having to pay 12
per cent interest instead of 6 per cent on the
money that had been borrowed. In one
year the excess interest alone amounted to
$5 million.
The operation and management of a railroad is a most difficult business. I do not
know of any other industry where absolute
co-operation between management and labour
is

so

necessary.

I

have had

considerable

experience in shipping cattle by rail, and I
know something of the dissatisfaction among
the railway employees because of the men
who were running the company.
I do not want to say anything which would
detract from the reputation of the fine man
who is presently at the head of the C.N.R.,
but I think I can say without fear of contradiction that he would be getting a lot more
co-operation from the railway employees
throughout the system had he come up from
their ranks. I think the railway company
would be better off if it were to choose as
its president a man of lesser stature, perhaps,
but who came from the ranks. He would
receive far more support from the men
throughout the entire system. They always
have the feeling that no matter how faithfully they serve throughout the years they
will be overlooked when a man is being chosen
for the top job in the system. I think this
is one objectionable feature in the way the
company has been handled.
It is true that Mr. Vaughan, a former
president of the company, had served the
company for some years; but I will say quite
frankly that his experience was of a political
nature. He was a purchasing agent for the
company, and in his work he showed a strong
political bias. During the period between
1930 and 1935 the price offered by the railway
for ties was reduced to 50 cents. He purposely

worked it so that one class of people in
Canada-the Conservatives, if you willwould sell nothing; or, if they made a sale,
would do so at a loss. Immediately after the
change of government the price of ties was
increased to 75 cents and $1. Before his
appointment as president he had no practical
railway experience. His experience while he
worked in the purchasing department was
principally political: he made purchases only
where they would serve the best interests of
the Liberal party.
Honourable senators, that is all I wish to
say at present.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question of the
senator who explained the bill (Hon. Mr.
Isnor)? In looking over the stocks that are
being transferred to the government, I notice
that the rate of interest runs from 2* to 3J
per cent. My question is this: Why is the
government going to pay 4 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think if my honourable
friend will follow the statement showing
the funded debt and also the outstanding
loans to the public and to the government,
he will find that the rates of interest vary.
The interest paid last year on loans by
the government amounted to more than $23
million, and the average rate of interest was
2-97 per cent. The interest of 4 per cent
mentioned is, I think, the rate on the preferred stock.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I have listened with a very great deal of
interest to the fine address delivered by the
senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr.
Isnor), and I wish to express my appreciation to him. The burning of midnight oil is
very evident in the information he bas
conveyed.
I have only a brief comment to make. First
of all I should like to refer to a remark made
by the senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), if he will permit me to do so. He
mentions the public ownership of the Canadian National Rail-ways as a socialistic enterprise, and the revision of its capital structure
as another illustration of the failure of
socialism. Well, I am not taking up the
cudgels at all in defence of socialism. I
look upon myself as being the very antithesis
of a socialist, but I do not think that the
public ownership and operation of a great
public service, such as a railroad, is socialism.
At all events, it is not my idea of socialism.
It is a public service operated by a public
body, the government of Canada. As to the
point that the Canadian National is an
illustration of the failure of socialism, if
socialism it be-and that depends on the
definition of the term-let me remind the
bouse that the grand figures of the railroad's

SENATE

indebtedness with which the senator has
been dealing are the result, not of socialism
at all, but of the inefficiency and graft of
private enterprise, which operated a number
of the railroads that were later consolidated
into the present system.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I was not complaining of
socialism, but of the fact that the railroads
were taken over by the government instead
of being allowed to fall into the hands of
receivers.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I agree with that sentiment. Arguments can be made on both sides
of the question, but I think it would have
been much better had we allowed those
privately owned and operated railroads to go
through the wringer.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Other concerns were
going through the wringer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, in the United States
and other countries. The private investor
took his chance on the success or failure of
the company in which be invested. If these
railroads had been a success the public would
not have been invited to take them over and
share in that success; and I see no reason
why, when the companies failed, the public
should have amalgamated them into one big
system and underwritten their obligations.
However, all that is a thing of the past.
We assumed the indebtedness, and we must
pay it.
In ýall probability the financial
rearrangement which has been described to
us so clearly is good in the main. It will
place this railroad of ours in a position to
hold up its head and to show that it is an
operating success, not an operating failure. I
think also that the efforts, the public spirited
efforts made by the management of the road,
will be encouraged by this rearrangement,
and I am all for it.
It seems to me that the senator from Blaine
lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) was a little hard on
a former president of the railroad.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, perhaps we can
differ on that. When one looks over the
record of a man in high position who has
dealt with difficult problems, one can condemn, on the one hand, or praise, on the
other. I like to look upon the virtues of that
particular individual and realize that he
rendered an immense service to the Dominion
of Canada.
I should like to say a word about the
present president of the Canadian National
Railways. He proved himself a very wise,
capable, industrious and public spirited servant when he was here in Ottawa during the
war. In those years we had him under the

closest observation. I myself have appeared
before him in a formal way-and informally
as well-and found him to be capable and
quick of grasp, and very ready to be helpful.
I do hope he will be successful in the future,
as I think he has been in the past. If I were
prognosticating, I should say that when his
term of office finally ends Donald Gordon
will leave a name outstanding in the industrial history of Canada.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to speak very long. At the
beginning of this session the press report of
the legislative program announced that the
government was going to relieve the Canadian National Railways of a burden of $723
million, as though you could just write off
that ýamount of debt. I asked my honourable
friend a question about this, but he did not
answer it.
What we are doing here is not writing off
$723 million, but simply transferring that
load from the shoulders of the Canadian
National Railways and its bondholders to
the shoulders of the Canadian taxpayers. In
1937-I recall, incidentally, that I was sitting on the other side of the chamber then,
because there was no room for me on this
side-we made the first revision of the
finances of the Canadian National Railways
by writing off obligations amounting to more
than one billion dollars. When the bill was
in committee I asked if those were the last
of the railway debts that would have to be
written off. I was assured at that time that
the final goal had been reached, and that in
future the rail enterprise would be able to
compete s'uccessfully with the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. But now we are asked to
vote $736 million, with no interest being paid
for ten years on a debt of $100 million. What
do we get in return? We are told that we
are to be given preferred stock. Well, what
good is preferred stock in a bankrupt
institution?
I would wholeheartedly support this legislation if I had any assurance that this writeoff would be the last, and that we would
not have to continue pouring millions and
millions of dollars into this institution.
Let me give you a little history of this
railway system. In the session of 1936, the
new government of the day, brought in a
bill to do away with the commission under
which the Canadian National Railway had
been operated, and to put it under political
control. Up to that time the railway had
been going behind about $50 million a year,
and that was before the billion dollars had
been written off. It was apparent to me that
a political administration would not be as
efficient as a commission, because, being

JUNE 19, 1952
human, it was bound to be influenced by
political considerations. For instance, if a
man felt that he was persona non grata with
the Conservative party, it would be only
natural for him to cater to the Liberals. In
that year the standing in this house was, I
think, 63 Conservatives to 33 Liberals. In
spite of that majority, we voted in favour of
the bill because we thought that the new
government had a mandate from the people
to deal with the railway question. The railway was placed under political control, and
the events of succeeding years show the sad
results. Deficits continued year after year;
and it was not until the war years, when the
government was required to spend millions
of dollars for transportation costs back and
forth across Canada, that the railway showed
any efficiency from a financial standpoint.
I am sure that 95 per cent of the people
of Canada are anxious that the Canadian
National Railways be placed on a sound
business basis in competition with other forms
of transportation, and that it pay its own way.
I am not in a position to know whether the
bill before us is any solution to the problem.
Certainly, it contains no promise that it will
be the last of its kind.
I was only a junior senator in this house
when the railway question was considered in
1936, and I was pretty well pushed around.
The proposal was that a billion dollars be
written off. But it was not really a write-off;
it was merely a transfer of the obligations of
the Canadian National Railways to the people
of Canada. I asked whether this would be
the last of such financial manoeuvres, and I
was told by some glib speakers that it was
They said that the Canadian
the end.
National was being put on a basis to compete
with the Canadian Pacific, and it would show
that big corporation, operated by private
interests, just how a railway should be run.
But what happened? Over the past twenty
years things have gone so badly that when
the Board of Transport Commissioners has
to do with the fixing of freight rates, it does
not take any thought of the operations of the
Canadian National but fixes the rates on the
basis of the operations of the Canadian
Pacific. I of course admit that the people of
Canada gave the Canadian Pacific a grant of
$25 million and some 25 million acres of land
which, unless a railway were built, was not
worth 25 cents.
But let us forget all about that early
history. The point now is that we must make
a final settlement with the Canadian National
Railway. From now on it has to stand on its
own feet; it has to sink or swim.
I would point out to my friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) that all the debt of
the Canadian National was not caused by the

operations of the Canadian Northern; millions
were lost on the Grand Trunk Pacific, and as
much more was lost on the National transcontinental. I recall as a student watching
the campaign which took place back in 1904.
I wondered at that time how a railway could
be run to successfully compete with the facilities already in existence. The results were
absolutely inevitable.
These are things which we as Canadians,
and especially those of us from the West,
remember. You people from Ontario and
Quebec have water and truck competition;
we in the West do not. Therefore, we must
pay the larger share of the freight costs on
both railways. You people from the Maritimes have water transport and a guaranteed
agreement as to freight rates. You can be
charged only so much, and the balance
is made up by the rest of Canada. We in the
West have no such guarantee; we pay the
whole shot ourselves. I got the shock of
my life last session when I saw how the
senators from the Maritimes stood together
on the question of frieght rates. Certainly,
there is no equalization of rates in the
Maritimes.
We in the West feel very keenly about this
railway question. We want the men and
women who run the Canadian National to
have the same chance to make a success of
their undertaking as have the men and
women who run the Canadian Pacific. We
want some assurance that the management
of the Canadian National will not always be
returning to parliament to get more money.
I cannot see that the passage of this bill
will be any solution to our problem. I repeat
that in 1936 we were assured that the action
then taken would clean up the whole system,
and that from then on the railway would
stand on its own feet. Today, we have no
promise at all that the passage of this bill
will be a final disposition of the matter.
According to press reports it would appear
that we are being asked to write off the
debt in the same way that a private individual in business might decide to write
off an uncollectable debt. But we are not
doing that at all; we are just transferring the
debt to the taxpayers of this country.
I enjoyed the speech of my friend from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor). He told
us a very nice story about the Minister of
Transport and the head of the Canadian
National Railways; and he gave high praise
to many others. But he never told us this
was a final settlement of the railway account.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How could he?
Hon. Mr. Haig: This bill should be the
final disposition of it. If I were going into

SENATE
a private venture I would want to know
when certain obligations were going to end.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Were you given any
such promise in 1937, when the billion
dollars was written off?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We were given to understand that that was the clean-up.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What good is that
kind of understanding?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Who gave you that
understanding?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We were given to believe
that the railway from then on would pay its
own way.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: By whom?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not remember the
names of the speakers; members of the government, I assume. It was my first session.
But I know the understanding was that the
billion dollar write-off would mark the end;
that afterwards the road would pay its
obligations.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is the railroad not paying, and has it not for the last number of
years paid, an operating profit under its
management?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Paying an operating profit?
My friend, who is going to pay for the cost
of the road? Surely, if I operate a railroad
I must earn interest on the money actually
invested in the road. The question is silly; it
is the sort of question that one sees in the
press and hears repeated on public platforms.
The C.N.R. take in so many millions, they
spend so many millions, and sometimes, on
that basis of operations, they can report that
they have made a profit. But they do not pay
anything on the cost of the road. If I am
running a business and take in $1,000 and
my expense for payment of employees is
$980, can I truly say that there is a profit of
$20, when I have paid neither rent nor light
nor taxes? That is substantially the situation here. Since this railroad started operations in 1923 it never paid the total cost of
operation until, three or four years ago, it
was granted an increase of rates.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Is the honourable
gentleman sure of that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. The figures show it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not according to the
auditors.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There has been an
operating profit the last few years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: A good part of the company's bonds were bought by the government.

The losses do not include the amount unpaid
on those bonds. Al that is included in the
reported losses was the portion of the interest owed to the public. It is this kind of
thing which makes me uneasy about the
whole basis of the financial arrangements.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would like to ask the
honourable gentleman another question, but
I do not want to harass him.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You will not harass me
a bit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I know he can take
care of himself. I understand him to object
to a shifting of this burden from the Canadian National Railways to the taxpayer. Is
it not a fact that the shift is from the users
or customers of the road, the men in whom
he is chiefly interested and for whom he
has been speaking, to the taxpayers?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The customers of the road,
for instance we people in the West who ship
our grain and cattle and hogs over the Canadian National railways, pay exactly the same
rates as are charged by the Canadian Pacific
Railway, because the Board of Transport
Commissioners fixes the rates at a figure at
which the Canadian Pacific Railway is able to
operate and make a reasonable profit. That
is the basis of all the adjudications. What
the Board have said, in effect, is "We do not
have regard to the C.N.R. at all. what we do
is to consider the position of the Canadian
Pacific Railway, what their operations cost
them, and how much they need to pay their
debts and provide for a reasonable dividend
on the capital invested in the road." That is
all. It makes no difference to me whether I
ship my wheat by the C.P.R. or the C.N.R.
Suppose that to enable the C.P.R. to pay its
way a rate of 40 cents per bushel is required
for the transportation of wheat from Blaine
Lake to Fort William or to Vancouver; the
board in assessing the rate inquires what it
costs the Canadian Pacific Railway to move
wheat that distance. That is how the rate is
determined.
I do not suppose that anyone in Canada
has a greater desire than I have that the
'Canadian National Railways be put on a
basis that is final, a basis upon which those
responsible for the railway's operation will
feel, "We can expect no more; we have got
to make a go of this". But today at the back
of the head of every Canadian National official there must exist the same feeling which
certainly existed in 1937, "If we can't make
the system pay we can go back to the government and get a bit more". It is very

JUNE 19, 1952
hard for the government to resist the demands
of the Canadian National Railways because
the men and women right across Canada who
work for it have votes; and-make no mistake
about it-they vote for the side which they
think they can force to give them consideration. That has been our experience in certain
districts of Winnipeg where some railway
men will always vote against our party,
because, they say, we favour the C.P.R. As
I have said, this kind of thing makes me
uneasy. We must be prepared to resist such
demands on the public purse. I venture to
predict that at the next general election
supporters of the government will be going
up and down the country, especially in districts where the Canadian National vote is
an important factor, telling of what they
"In 1937",
have done for that railroad.
they will say, "we wrote off a billion dollars:
now, in 1952, we have written off another $743
million; and, fellows, if you stick with us,
in a year or two we will write off another
$500 million."
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Has the honourable
senator any recollection of a vote of $30
million which was put through the Parliament
of Canada for the Bank of Commerce, to
relieve it from the pressure which Mackenzie
and Mann were putting on the bank at the
time? It occurred, I might say, in 1916,
during the administration of Sir Robert Borden and the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not question that statement. The government of the day decided
that those to whom the debt was owing
should be paid. That was their judgment.
That does not alter my opinion at all. The
principle is wrong.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: My reason for asking
the question was that my honourable friend
is assuming that all the indebtedness of the
Canadian National Railway originated with
that railway. In fact, it originated with the
Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk and all
the other parties to the amalgamation which
my honourable friend's predecessors brought
into being.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I put in my own
language what the honourable member has
said. He asserts that in 1916 a Conservative
government voted $30 million. Al I have to
say about that is that the Conservatives of
the time were a "bunch of pikers", because
the Liberals in 1937 voted a billion dollars,
and now, in 1952, they are voting another
$743 million.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: They did not vote it to
a bank.

Hon. Mr. Haig: But the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) asserts
that our party voted $30 million in 1916, and
he asks me what I think of men who would
do such a thing. I repeat that I think they
were a "bunch of pikers" compared with a
Liberal administration which fifteen years
ago voted a billion dollars and is now ready
to vote another $743 million. In the light
of those transactions, had I been in the place
of those poor old Conservatives I might have
done more.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My friend must remember
that his party never had an opportunity to
vote any more money.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it had-from 1930
to 1935. If it had not been in power at that
time I would not have been here; I would
have been kicking my heels around Winnipeg,
trying to earn a dollar or two.
But I return to my main point. I want the
responsible authorities to tell us that "This
is the last throw; this is the last time the
taxpayers of Canada will have to come to the
assistance of the Canadian National or any
other railway". I want to know whether they
are ready to give that definite assurance.
But I have no doubt that my honourable
friends cannot give any such undertaking;
they do not know what will happen five years
from now. Perhaps they will come back at
that time and ask for another $700 million.
But if I am here when the Conservatives
return to power, and if, in pursuance of the
policy which is now commended to us, they
do not offer a larger contribution than $30
million, I shall be tempted to cross to the
opposition benches, because, I say again, they
would certainly be a mere "bunch of pikers".
I will vote for the bill as far as it goes,
but I maintain that it does not answer the
question in my mind: Will this be the end?
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
in rising to say a few words in this debate I
want to congratulate the honourable gentleman who sponsored this bill (Hon. Mr. Isnor).
Our honourable colleague from HalifaxDartmouth did exceedingly well, notwithstanding some of the sarcasm thrown his way
by certain members in this chamber. The
honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) claimed that the administration of the C.N.R. was a good example
of socialism. If this is true, then the father
of socialism in this country was the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen.
The very able and intelligent leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) claimed that
the administration of the C.N.R. had been
a complete failure, and that he would like
some responsible member of the government

SENATE

to assure him that no more deficits will be
suffered by the company. He reminds me
of a father who spoils his child by giving
him too much money to spend, and then
suddenly says, "Well, that is the last time
you'll get any money from me, my boy.
You needn't ask me for any more money
because you won't get it". I have never
seen a father who has been able to keep
such a promise, and I am sure the honourable
gentleman from Winnipeg has not either.
If the administration of the Canadian
National Railways has been a failure, it is
due to the actions of the Union Government,
whose leader was the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen. I remember when my
predecessor in the other house, Roch Lanctot,
M.P., for Laprairie-Napierville, advised Mr.
Meighen to sell the C.N.R. for one dollar.
He said that it would pay the country to
do this, and he predicted that the amalgamation of various railways under the control
of the Canadian government would prove
costly. If the administration of the C.N.R.
has been a failure, as my friends opposite
would have us believe, then the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen should have
taken Mr. Lanctot's advice.
Our friends on the other side of the house
claim that the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company has done well as a privatelyowned business, and that the Canadian
National Railway Company bas proved a
failure because it is publicly-owned. One
would conclude from their remarks that
it is inadvisable to place a big undertaking
like the operation of the C.N.R. under the
care of the government. But let me point
out this fact. If my memory serves me well,
the Right Honourable R. B. Bennett had a
bill put through the other place in 1933 or
1934 to lend $60 million to the privatelyowned C.P.R.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Was that money paid back?
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it was.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: If it was paid back it
does not appear any more than does the
money which was loaned to the provinces
during the period of unemployment in the
thirties. I bring out this point to show that
even a company like the C.P.R. has found it
necessary to borrow money in order to stay
in business. We must not forget that the
C.N.R. gives its users all across Canada many
advantages in the way of freight rates, and
so on. For instance, nobody objected when
the Crow's Nest Pass rates were granted
some years ago. As a publicly-owned company,
the C.N.R. is being requested every day to
grant privileges to some part of the country.
I am not on my feet to defend the C.N.R.

or the system of public ownership, but I
believe that the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) and his colleague from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) have been ill-advised
to speak as they have in connection with the
measure now before the house.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I cannot add anything to what my
distinguished colleague, the sponsor of this
measure (Hon. Mr. Isnor), has said about this
legislation, but I rather gathered the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) was addressing his remraks to me when he was demanding some assurance that the capital structure
of the C.N.R. would not be revised again. If
he was, I can assure him that he will get no
such assurance from me. I do not know what
happened in 1937, but if somebody was silly
enough to give him some assurance then, it
is no reason why in the world I should be
silly enough to do so now.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. P. Howden: Honourable senators,
I have listened with interest to the debate on
this measure. I should like to congratulate
the honourable gentleman from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) on the excellent manner in which he has handled this bill. I
should like to be able to congratulate some
of the other speakers as well, but the trouble
is I do not believe what they have said.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Howden: As a former chairman
of the House of Commons Committee on Railways and Shipping, I gained some knowledge
of this subject, and I think that once and for
all we should straighten out our understanding of this railway business.
To begin with, the government of Canada
built the Canadian Pacifie Railway and
advanced the company $75 million-not $25
million. Furthermore, the government practically built the Crowsnest Pass, and gave
the Canadian Pacifie another $75 million.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: $25 million.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Sir William Mackenzie
started then with his partner, Sir Donald
Mann, to build the Canadian Northern Railway. Sir William probably borrowed money
where he had to, but eventually he found it
necessary to have very heavy obligations
underwritten by the government of Canada.
There is no doubt about that. Then, in 1904,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier came along with his proposal for a transcontinental railway. That
may have been a political dodge; I do not
know. I always was a supporter of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, but I am quite satisfied to
admit that I believe that the railway was a

JUNE 1
booster for the Liberal party at the time. If
I remember rightly, the Grand Trunk Railway, which already owed substantial amounts
to the government for guaranteed bonds and
things of that kind, offered to make a deal
with Sir Wilfrid, whereby the government
would build for the Grand Trunk a railway
to be known as the Grand Trunk Pacifie,
running from Redditt, about 130 miles this
side of Winnipeg, out to the Pacifie Coast.
The cost of construction was to be lent to
the Grand Trunk, which was to take over
the new road, when completed, and operate
it. Sir Wilfrid also agreed to build the
National Transcontinental, from Redditt to
Quebec, as a publicly owned road, and it
and the Grand Trunk Pacifie were to be operated as one line by the Grand Trunk. But
by the time the Grand Trunk Pacifie was
completed, the Grand Trunk Railway itself
was defunet, and it never operated the new
Une for a single day. The Government of
Canada also paid for the Intercolonial Railway in the Maritime Provinces. The liabilities of all these railroads were underwritten
by the government, and if the companies
had gone into receivership in 1923 the government would still have had to pay the
tremendous amount of the debts, for which
it was liable in any event, and would have
had nothing to show for it.
The Right Honourable Arthur Meighen is
called the father of the Canadian National
Railways. He is given credit for having
figured out the amalgamation proposal and
brought the deal to a head, and I believe he
does deserve credit for that. It was no small
job. But the Canadian National system,
composed of these amalgamated railroads,
could not begin to show a profit over operating expenses if it had to pay interest on the
tremendous funded debt that it had inherited
when it started off. The interest on this
debt has been piling up throughout the years
and is still growing.
What is the use now of fighting over all
these things? What is the use of discussing at
this date what we are going to do with the
National Transcontinental? The blame for
what happened cannot be placed on the shoulders of any one person.
A first-class railroadman, Sir Henry
Thornton, was engaged to operate the Canadian National Railways system and he did a
good job: he made a railroad of it. Speaking
generally, everybody was pleased with the
Canadian National, and still is. Of course,
there is room for some improvements. Riding over the road, as I do, I recognize this.
But I suppose the same thing could be said
of any railroad.

While a member of the other house I was
for five years chairman of a committee which
investigated the business of the publicly
owned railroads, and I want to point out
that one year the Canadian National did show
an operating profit of $75 million. It is true
that some fifteen or twenty or thirty million
dollars had to be voted to the road for
betterments in the way of rolling stock
needed next year, but certainly there was
no doubt of the earning of $75 million. And
in four or five other years it made money;
and one year it broke about even.
What is the use of fighting about this road
now? It belongs to Canada, and we cannot
allow it to go into the hands of receivers.
We have to pay our obligations. Let us do
all we can to help the company operate successfully. It seems to me that the proposal
made in this bill is a good one, and that it
should be accepted.
That is all I have to say on the matter,
honourable senators. I think it is a lot
nearer the truth than what we were given
to understand a while ago.
Hon. A. L. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I wish to say just a word or two. This
debate has brought things back to my mind.
The senator from Blaine lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) has refreshed my memory of many
happenings in the years from 1930 to 1935,
but I am sorry that he has brought politics
into his remarks.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is too bad. This
is a purely political matter that we are talking about.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: But I was greatly
interested in his remark that an establishment like the Canadian National Railways
cannot be run efficiently without the
co-operation of the employees of the
company.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I agree with that.
However, I happened to be a member of
the Railway Committee of the House of
Commons from 1930 to 1935, when the honourable senator's friends were in office, and
I know that they did everything within their
power to crucify the then president of the
company, Sir Henry Thornton, who had the
co-operation of every member of the staff.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They did not.
better than that.

I know

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend
will know this, that employees of the Canadian National still pay homage to Sir Henry
Thornton.
At least once a year they
assemble before plaques that are erected in

SENATE
practically every station along the line and
have a ceremony in honour of his memory.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It would take a couple
of days to tell you about some things.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: My honourable friend
also said something about the sale of railroad
ties. In England, I think, they are called
sleepers.
Hon. Mr. Horner: "Ties" is the word.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: As I understood him,
he said that when the Liberals were in
office the Canadian National would not buy
ties without first making sure that the person who offered them for sale was a Grit.
Well, honourable members, between 1930 and
1935 a student trying to earn enough money
to pay his way through university could not
get a summer's work on the Canadian
National unless he was approved by the hierarchy of the Conservative Party.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Nonsense!
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I speak from personal
knowledge, for on one occasion I tried to get
a university student a job with the railway
in order to finance himself through the
remainder of his studies. To reach the heirarchy of the Conservative party at that time
was like trying to get from earth to heaven.
So my honourable friend would be well
advised to refrain from mentioning the need
for co-operation in the running of an institution like the Canadian National Railways,
when his own friends did everything they
could to crucify the man who brought about
co-operation and made the railway work.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They did not.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, if I
may be permitted to make one or two comments to clear up some misunderstanding,
I promise not to enter into any political controversy. Politics would be the last thing to
enter my mind in this connection.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; we are sure of that.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: My honourable friend's
retort suggests that he has some doubt about
the seriousness of my remark.
The honourable leader opposite referred to
the matter of the yardstick used by the Board
of Transport Commissioners for the measurement of rates. I would point out that the
reason the C.P.R. is used in this way is that
it presents a comparable financial picture
along lines which are satisfactory to the
Board and have proved to be sound. With
the reconstruction of our financial position in
respect of the Canadian National Railways I
hope that the balance sheet will be along
similar lines, and will clearly reflect the true
picture of the rail operations. In that way
the Board of Transport Commissioners, and

the public as well, will be able to place the
two pictures side by side and judge the efficiency and earning capacity of the two
systems.
I think there was some unintentional misunderstanding as to certain figures I gave.
I would point out that during the period
1941-45 the Canadian National Railways
turned over to the Government of Canada
$113 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But they did not pay interest on the government's debt.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That was the net amount
turned over to the Canadian Government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But that did not pay the
interest on the outstanding debt owing to
the government.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Yes, it included interest
on the debt.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: We have placed before us
each year a balance sheet showing the interest
paid and so on. The honourable member from
St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden) said that
the railway has earned certain amounts. In
the period which I mentioned, 1941-45, $113
million was turned over to the government by
the railway.
Hon. Mr. Howden: I said that $75 million
was earned in a particular year, and that this
would pay the interest on the bonds; however, it left the railway system short $30
million for replacements which it needed for
the following year, and this amount had to
be voted by parliament.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes; that is for additions
and betterments. But the figures which I am
now putting on the record give, I believe, the
true picture.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But did the $113 million
include interest on the debt to the government
for advances previously made to the railway?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I do not think they paid
interest on the $1,200 million odd. In this
connection I was pleased to hear my friend
use the word "transfer", for that action will
not affect the assets of the Government of
Canada. Our position as disclosed by the
public accounts will be the same, as between
assets and liabilities, after the transfer has
taken place. It does, however, relieve the
Canadian National Railways of the interest
charge of about $23 million. The securities
which are given in exchange for government
loans are shown as an active asset in the
balance sheet of Canada. The trust securities are presently carried in the public
accounts as non-active assets of the Canadian
National Railways and stock received in the
transfer will likewise be shown as a nonactive asset.

JUNE 19, 1952
I would not attempt to set up the Canadian
Pacifie as an example, and analyse its financial statement; however, I feel that by looking at the reports of the two companies it
immediately becomes obvious that the Canadian Pacifie has a great advantage over the
government-owned railway by reason of the
large revenue derived from the operations
of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting
Company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Did the Canadian
National Railway, when it was organized,
receive a land grant from the Crown, as did
the Canadian Pacifie?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am not fully prepared
to answer all such questions, but I would
be inclined to say that both railways received
benefits.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But the C.N.R. did
not get land grants.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Certainly not to the same
extent as the C.P.R.?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They received money from
our province.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
this bill would properly be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, and the bill about to be
explained by the senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) would normally go to
the Standing Committee on Immigration and
Labour, but as the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce is the active
committee of the house at this stage
of the session, honourable senators might
agree to allow this measure to go before
that committee.
If there is no objection, I would move that
the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved second reading
of Bill 322, an Act to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
He said: Honourable senators, I am pleased
to have the opportunity of explaining this
bill, because I had the privilege, back in
1940, of being a member of the committee
which considered the original Act.

May I preface my brief remarks by a few
words about the Unemployment Insurance
Act? It is one of the most important pieces
of social legislation on the statutes, and fulfils
a most necessary and important function
in the economy of the country. The Act was
assented to on August 7, 1940, and since that
time it has operated throughout a period of
comparative prosperity. Even under these
conditions, the payments from the fund, as
of March 31 last, totalled $458 million.
The fund is built up fron contributions by
employers and employees, the government
adding one-fifth to the total amount collected.
Even after large withdrawals, the fund at
May 31 had accumulated a balance of something over $789 million, which is a substantial
insurance against payments which might have
to be made under less favourable conditions.
In view of criticisms which have been made
with regard to the size of the fund, it seems
quite appropriate to point out, in the first
place, that this money is invested in government bonds, from which last year $19
million was received in interest. Receipts and
total revenue to the end of May of this year
totalled $203,782,503, and this year to date
well over $90 million has been paid out. There
is a balance in the fund of some $778 million.
Claims on the fund amount to only $200 per
person, or the equivalent of ten weeks' payments of $20.
Insured persons number
2,915,000, and non-insured 934,000.
It should be noted that the Unemployment
Insurance Commission performs a splendid
service apart from receipts and payments in
respect of unemployment insurance. It
handles placements, provides positions, and
makes contacts between unemployed persons
and employers in need of help.
I come now to the bill itself. It contains
some twenty amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act, of which five are of major
importance, the remainder being more of
an administrative nature.
The most important amendment raises
unemployent
insurance benefits
without
increasing the contributions. The maximum
benefit for a person with a dependent is now
$21 per week. This will be increased to $24
per week. On a daily basis, the increase is
from $3.50 to $4. The other classes of benefit, except the two lower classes, will show
comparable increases. In the two lower classes
the relationship between the benefit and the
minimum wage in the class is considered to be
now as high as is possible without resulting in
over-insurance.
The second major amendment reduces the
waiting period by three days. At the present
time, at the beginning of each benefit year

SENATE
there is a waiting period of eight days. The
bill provides that this period shall be reduced
to five days. In addition to the waiting period
there is at the beginning of each period of
unemployment what is known as "one noncompensable day", and the effect of the
amendment is that no benefits will be paid for
the first week after a person files a claim
rather than, at present, for the first nine days.
There is also a provision which will permit the commission by regulation to defer
this waiting period where it occurs during
a period of unemployment. When a person
becomes unemployed and makes a claim for
benefit, what is known as "a benefit year" is
set up, and it quite often happens that these
benefit years terminate while a person is
unemployed and the claimant is able to
qualify immediately for a second benefit year.
Under the present Act, he would receive no
benefit for the first nine days of the second
benefit year, even though he might have
been unemployed for some considerable time.
The new provision will permit the commission
to postpone this waiting period, so that it will
not fall quite so heavily on the claimant when
he can least afford to be without benefit.
The fourth major amendment has to do
It will be
with supplementary benefits.
remembered that in February of 1950 the
Act was amended to give a reduced benefit to
certain classes of people who could not
qualify for the regular benefit. These supplementary benefits are at the present time
payable during the period from January 1 to
March 31, when unemployment is usually at
its highest peak of the year. The amendment
will extend this period to April 15.
These four amendments which affect the
Unemployment Insurance Fund have been
recommended by the commission and by the
Unemployment Insurance Advisory Committee. The committee, as honourable senators
know, is composed of representatives of management and labour, so I think it is fair to
say that these amendments are made with
the approval of the major national labour
bodies as well as of representatives of those
concerned with management problems.
The last of the major amendments to which
I will refer has to do with the employment
service, and gives statutory effect to a practice
which has been followed by the employment
service for many years. It provides that
there will be no discrimination in the selection of applicants for placement because of
racial origin, colour, religious belief, or political affiliation. While there are limits, of
course, to which the employment service
can go, because after all it is performing a
voluntary service for both workers and
employers, the amendment gives statutory

recognition to the principle that there should
be no discrimination; and, by reason of the
close contacts between the employment officers
and industry, it is hoped that the principle can
be developed along proper lines.
Other amendments are, as previously stated,
more of an administrative nature and make
minor adjustments which experience has
shown to be necessary. The more important
of these are in clauses 8 and 9, which provide
a higher minimum penalty for second offenders. There are other amendments which
simplify court procedures and reduce the
costs of prosecutions.
The bill contains twenty amendments, but
I have dealt with the major or salient points,
and any further information required can be
obtained when the bill goes to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. McLean: The sponsor of the bill
mentioned bonds and investments. Are these
held at book value or market value?
Hon. Mr. Reid: As far as I know, the investments are in Canadian government bonds
bearing interest at 3 per cent. In order
not to demoralize the market, when money
is required from the fund it is obtained by
way of borrowings on the security of the
bonds.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I assume that these
investments were made some years ago.
Recently we have had a policy of higher
interest rates, and consequently the value
of these bonds has steadily declined. The
question I asked was whether the bonds
are now shown at their market value or
their book value.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What was paid for
them? Were they bought above par?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I don't know.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: That is the way most
of us bought them.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I can only say that they are
government 3 per cent bonds, and I think they
are a pretty good investment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is it intended to send this
bill to committee?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
The motion was agred to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I move
that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. F. W. Gershaw moved the second
reading of Bill 337, an Act respecting the
Northwest Territories.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
deals with that vast northern territory which
is the land of the midnight sun, a land of
long, dreary, cold winters and of sparse
population. In the Northwest Territories
there is a population of 16,004, of whom
roughly 5,000 are white, 4,000 Indians and
6,199 Eskimos.
The economy of the Eskimos, the largest
group in the territory, depends principally
upon the reindeer. Away back in 1929 the
Dominion Government made an agreement
Company,
with the Alaskan Reindeer
whereby the company undertook to trail
some three thousand reindeer from their
feeding grounds in Alaska through the icy
passes in the mountains and over unpopulated
territory to the mouth of the Mackenzie
River. During that trek the reindeer were
preyed upon by wolves and other animals;
they had to face the storms of summer and
the blizzards of winter, and some of them
escaped and found their way back over the
mountains, or died in the attempt. But in
three years time, by 1935, some 2,370 reindeer
had reached their destination at the mouth of
the Mackenzie River.
Here preparations had been made for their
arrival; corrals had been built, and three
families of Laplanders had been imported
from Norway to help take care of the animals.
Some 6,600 acres of land had been set aside
in the delta of the Mackenzie River, and a
number of Eskimoes had been trained in the
work that was to be done. Thus the people
of the area were assured of a livelihood. A
rancher from Southern Alberta went north
to make suggestions regarding the round-up,
the grazing ranges, the care of hides and
meat, and ways of protecting the reindeer
against predatory animals and poisonous
insects.
In spite of the disasters which occurred,
by round-up time in 1951, the five herds of
reindeer numbered some 8,712, so five or six
hundred of the animals could be killed off
each year to feed the people.
Honourable senators, just a year ago this
house passed an amendment to the Northwest
Territories Act, which made provision for a
council of eight, three of whom were to be
elected. I may say that since that time
three constituencies-Mackenzie North, Mackenzie South and Mackenzie West-have been
carved out along the Mackenzie river. Three
men, Mr. Hardie, Mr. Brodie and Mr. Carmichael, were elected to represent these three
constituencies.
It is a matter of some satisfaction that it
was a member of this house who suggested
that the qualifications for voting should be
decided upon not by the small group of the

commissioner and council of the Territories,
but by the Governor in Council of Canada.
By section 9 of the bill before us that suggestion is being implemented. I am sure
that the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and others will
be pleased to note that this suggestion has
been adopted.
In that north country the Indians and
Eskimos vote at the elections. From conversation with the officials who have the
work of the Territories in hand, one can
readily see that it is their aim to increase
the number of their elected representatives
from time to time as the population increases;
but for the present time Canada has such
a large investment in that area that it is felt
there should be some .control over the government of the Territories.
The eight members of the council meet
twice a year; one session is held in Ottawa
and one in the Northwest Territories. Last
year one session was held at Yellowknife,
with full ceremonial dress and procedure.
The people of that district appreciated it
very much, and gave the new government
a warm welcome. Future sessions may be
held at Fort Smith or Hay River, which are
two other towns up there.
Each of the three elected members is
entitled to $50 for each day that he attends
the session, but he is limited to $1,000 a year;
and each of the eight members is reimbursed
his actual travelling expenses to and from
the place where the session is held, but for
only one trip each session. Also there is
living allowance of $25 for each day -during
attendance at the session, and this is not
regarded as income for purposes of the
Income Tax Act.
Because of the setting up of this council,
and in view of the great oil exploration that
is taking place and the extension of mining
and fishing, it is felt that there should be a
reorganization of the functions and responsibilities of the council. That is why this
consolidation has been made. The bill contains little that is new; in the main it consolidates the amendments which have been
made to the Northwest Territories Act since
the time of confederation.
Briefly two main things have been done.
First, a territorial revenue account has been
set up in Ottawa, and will be administered
by the minister on the advice of the council.
Heretofore the council bas had very little
revenue, practically all of it being confined
to receipts in respect of liquor; but now it
will derive revenues from fur exports, game
licences, business licences, a direct tax, a
gasoline tax, and-if it should see fit to

JUNE 20, 1952
impose one-a poll tax. In addition, the territories, like some of the provinces, have
rented taxation rights to the dominion, and
in return they receive about $200,000 by way
of a subsidy from the dominion, This, added
to $400,000 received from the other sources
I have mentioned, will provide a credit of
about $600,000.
How will this money be spent? The council will provide for educational expenses
throughout this vast territory, for hospitals,
for relief, and for certain roads. It is
estimated that these and other obligations
will absorb $580,000, leaving a small surplus
in that particular account. But if the share
of the territories in general dominion expenditure for defence, police, and social security
is taken into consideration, it will be seen
that the dominion is providing about $7,000,000 and receving in return one-tenth of that
amount, or about $700,000.
The question of intoxicants has had a good
deal of attention. It has been arranged that
the executive body, which is the commissioner, shall have full control of the manufacture of intoxicating liquor for the
territories, and of its importation from any
part of Canada or elsewhere. Indians and
Eskimos, of course, are not allowed to purchase liquor.
The one other change of importance is the
re-establishment of the territorial courts.
Before 1905, in which year the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta were created,
there were territorial courts in the Northwest Territories. Since then justice has been
administered by stipendiary magistrates. It
is proposed that the judge of the Yukon shall
also be judge of the Northwest Territories,
and provision is made for the appointment
of deputy judges should this be found
necessary.
Provision is made in the bill for the
appointment of barristers or advocates as
police magistrates in the Northwest Territories. These magistrates will be vested with
part of the civil jurisdiction formerly exercised by stipendiary magistrates and justices
of the peace.
The bill provides for appeals from the
Superior Courts of provinces exercising concurrent jurisdiction. Appeals from districts
north of Labrador will go to Quebec courts,
and appeals from the districts north of
Alberta will go to the Alberta courts. Generally speaking, the administration of justice
in the Northwest Territories will be by the
territorial courts.
The commissioner is Major General Young,
Deputy Minister of Resources and Development, and he is assisted by the Commissioner
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The
55708-32J

Commissioner in Council is given a good
many of the duties carried out by the provincial governments and has power to
legislate with regard to roads, reindeer,
intoxicants, insane persons, neglected children, hospitals, and so on.
Honourable senators, the real purpose of
this legislation is to give greater self-government to the Northwest Territories, so as to
make it easier for them to raise their standard of living and add to the well-being and
happiness of the people in that distant region.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Can the honourable
senator who sponsors this bill (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) tell the house how many judges
will be appointed?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The judge of the Yukon
will be also judge of the Northwest Territories. That is the only appointment that
will be made for the present time, but provision is made for the appointment of deputy
judges if they are required. There will be a
number of police magistrates in Fort Smith,
Yellow Knife, and various other places
throughout the territories.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, in
May of last year I spoke in favour of a bill
to amendi te Northwest Territories Act. At
that time I was strongly in favour of the
action being taken, and I am pleased to note
that the bill now before the house is a vast
improvement over the former legislation. No
doubt this is as a result of the increased
population in the Northwest Territories. I
did not know that there were as many as
5,000 white settlers in the territories.
I think it is well that territorial courts are
being set up, because heretofore the cost of
litigation has been excessive. Litigants will
now be relieved to a large extent of the
heavy costs that heretofore have prevailed.
As I understand it, the cost of administering
the provisions of this Act will be about $7
million.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And the federal government will receive in return aboutHon. Mr. Gershaw: Some $700,000 altogether.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I am sure the residents
of the Northwest Territories will be happy
to know that the Canadian government intends to see that their roads, their reindeer
herds, and so on, will be well taken care of.
They will also be pleased to know that their
lawsuits will be properly heard, and that in
cases involving more than $500 they will
have the right to appeal to the provincial

SENATE

court of appeal in the province which is
closest to the place where the case originated.
I was greatly interested in the remarks the
honourable senator made about the reindeer
herds. I have followed their progress for a
number of years. I am pleased to note that
some 2,370 reindeers have survived, and that
the herd has increased by approximately
fourfold. These reindeer will provide clothing
and food for most of the inhabitants of the
far north, particularly the Eskimos and
Indians.
There are provisions in the bill having to
do with intoxicating liquors, insane persons,
neglected children, and so on, about which
I should like more information; but if the
bill is referred to committee my questions
can be fully answered there.
Hon. Mr. Reid: At the outset of his remarks
the honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) spoke about the wonderful work that is being done to propagate the
reindeer herd. In view of the statements
coming out of the north about the Eskimos
becoming "soft" since being provided with
some of our social welfare benefits, I would
like to ask if the honourable senator can give
us any information about the Eskimo population and the condition of their health. If that
information is not available now, I think it
should be supplied in committee.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
our colleague who explained this bill has
given a good account of present conditions
in the Northwest Territories. I have had
little opportunity to examine this bill, but
I do not think it contains anything worth
commenting on in the way of powers that may
be given to the Northwest Territories Council. Quite obviously this is another step
forward in providing the Northwest Territories with self-government; and it follows in
broad outline the development that took
place in the old Northwest Territories, now the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The Council is to have eight members,
five to be appointed by the government and
three to be elected. This council is given
pretty broad legislative power. By virtue
of power similar in character to that exercised
by the provinces today, it can impose taxes
and make regulations regarding health and
other matters.
The bill provides for the establishment of
courts and the administration of justice. This
is a natural development, proceeding I think
along the right lines; but the government
very wisely has retained power to supervise
what is done by the territorial council. If
the territorial council passes an enactment
that in the judgment of the government is

not wise or desirable, the government has
the power to disallow it; and that power, I
believe, is exercisable within two years of
the passing of the enactment.
There are one or two questions on which
further information might be secured when
the bill goes, as I presume it will, to a committee. I find myself at a loss to understand
quite what is meant by section 26, which
apparently gives every judge of the court
that is to be established for the Northwest
Territories power to try cases outside of the
territories. That may be wholly desirable,
and at the moment I am not objecting to it,
but it does appear to me rather unusual
procedure. It would seem to me analagous to
give an Ontario judge, say, power to try la
Manitoba persons charged with having committed offences in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That would not be as
bad as making it possible for Canadians to
be tried in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not know about that.
But as I read this section, rather hurriedly,
it appeared to me that some explanation of
it might be given.
As I ran through the bill I marked portions
that were not clear to me, and there are two
other sections that I wish to mention. I
notice from section 37 that the officers of the
court and other officers for administration of
justice in the territories are to be appointed
by the Governor in Council. That, I take it,
means that they are to be appointed by
the government here. The provision may be
a wise one, but it occurred to me that as we
are setting up a local government the
responsibility of making these appointments
might be entrusted to it.
The other section to which I wish to refer
is section 41, which deals with the protection
and development of reindeer in the territories. This is a wholly sound provision. The
introduction of reindeer into this northern
country was a very wise move. As honourable senators are aware, the experiment was
fraught with considerable difficulty. The
reindeer had to be secured in Alaska and
herded around to the Mackenzie river delta
and east of the delta, a movement which
took more than two years. The reindeer,
whose natural food exists pretty generally
over the Northwest Territories, is suited to
the climatic conditions in that part of Canada.
It provides meat and milk for domestic purposes, and its skin is useful for clothing in
those northern regions.
I notice that no provision is made for protection of the caribou, and I was wondering
whether this animal was included under the
general heading of reindeer. If it is not, I
think that some authority to protect this

JUNE 20, 1952
animal should be given to the Northwest
Territories Council. As is well known, the
caribou move south in the latter part of the
year, and winter in northern Manitoba; and
when spring comes along they move back
north, to pretty well within the Arctic Circle.
There is no doubt that they are essential to
the life of the Indians and Eskimos in the
region of Hudson's Bay and west of Hudson's

decimated by wolves, and reports that one
gets now indicate that the number of caribou
is being steadily reduced.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Are the caribou and the
reindeer not of the same species?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They have not been so
described in literature. It may be that the
caribou are included within the provisions of
this section, or that the eastern Arctic
authorities have some responsibility for protecting these animals. However, that is a
point on which information can be obtained
in committee.
In a general way I think the legislation is
progressive and necessary. It marks an additiofñal step forward in the development of
that part of Canada which until very recently
was regarded as a frozen and useless waste.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: I should like to
ask a question about section 29. If the
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) has not the information here, it can be
got in committee. I am wondering just how
the 102nd meridian divides the Northwest
Territories.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I have no information
on that point. In a general way, the idea

is that appeals will be taken to the Appellate
Court of the province which is closest to
the parties concerned.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: What I am interested
in is whether the 102nd meridian is as far
east as Hudson's Bay or if it takes in part of
the Northwest Territories. I do not see how
courts in the Province of Prince Edward
Island, for instance, could properly handle
cases arising in any portion of the Northwest
Territories.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the

EASTERN ROCKY MOUNTAIN
CONSERVATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of Bill E-13, an Act to amend the Eastern
Rocky Mountain Forest Conservation Act.
Hon. Robert Henry Winters (Minister of
Resources
and Development):
Honourable
senators, as this is the first time I have had
the privilege of being in this chamber on
such an occasion, I hope you will allow me
to say how much I appreciate the honour. I
shall do my best to explain what is a very
short but quite important bill.
By way of background I might say that
an agreement was signed in June 1947 between the Government of Alberta and the

JUNE 23, 1952
Government of Canada to protect the forest
cover of that part of the eastern slopes of
the Rocky Mountains in which rise the North
and South Saskatchewan rivers and in which
they have their initial drainage. I know
there are present today a number of honourable senators who are quite familiar with
this project; in particular, the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
who had a great deal to do with it at its
inception. In July 1947, this agreement was
ratified by an Act entitled The Eastern Rocky
Mountain Forest Conservation Act.
The area in question covers five and a
half million acres, which is 8,618 -74 square
miles. It might be helpful by way of comparison to point out that the area of Prince
Edward Island is 2,184 square miles, and
of Nova Scotia, 21,068 square miles.
The agreement and the Act provided that
a board be set up to consist of three members, two to be appointed by the Governor
in Council and one by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the Province of Alberta.
The Act and the agreement gave the Governor in Council the right to appoint one of
the two federal appointees as chairman of
the board. The agreement came into effect
on April 1, 1948, and is to run for a term of
twenty-five years.
The capital expenditure period is a term
of six years. The Act provides for a total
of $6,300,000, to be
capital expenditure
borne in its entirety by the federal government. There is provision for a maintenance
program of a minimum of $250,000 and a
maximum of $300,000 a year, to be borne on
the basis of a formula under which the federal government undertakes to pay up to
$175,000 a year. The revenues from the surface rights in the project area apply against
the maintenance, and if they are in excess of
$125,000 per annum the federal government's
expenditure on maintenance is reduced correspondingly from $175,000 per annum. The
basis of fire-fighting is that for expenditure
over $10,000 a year the cost is borne equally
by the federal government and the provincial government.
The capital expenditure period would normally expire on April 1, 1954, but for a
number of reasons it has not been possible to
make as good progress as was anticipated.
The chief reason is that 1951-52 was a particularly wet year in Alberta, and it was
very difficult to proceed with the major part
of the agreement, which is the building of
roads. Also it is necessary to carry out a
considerable amount of preliminary investigation before the whole program can be
finalized, and some work remains to be

done in that field. Further, it has been
found that the maintenance program as provided for in the act to a maximum of $300,000
per annum is not sufficient in the light of the
magnitude of the project or of present-day
costs. The two signatories have reviewed
the agreement and certain changes are now
sought. In the first place it bas been
deemed advisable to ask for a one-year
extension for the capital expenditure, making
it a seven-year period instead of a six-year
The amount of the expenditures
period.
remains the same, $6,300,000, and is still the
responsibility of the federal government.
The provincial government bas asked that
the maintenance allotment each year be
increased from the present maximum of
$300,000 to $450,000. At the same time, the
government of Alberta has agreed to assume
the full maintenance costs and, in the light
of this, bas requested that at the end of the
capital-expenditure period the composition of
the board be changed to enable the provincial government to have two members instead of one, as at present, and the federal
government to have one member instead of
two. Instead of the Governor in Council
having the right to designate the chairman,
the Lieutenant Governor in Council of Alberta will now have this right, but the agreement provides that the Chairman may, if so
desired, be the federal member on the board.
Honourable senators, those are the basic
changes being sought by this legislation. The
new agreement bas been signed by both the
federal government and the government of
Alberta, but will not be promulgated, of
course, until it is approved by both the provincial legislature and the federal parliament.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a question
about this bill while the minister is with
us? First of all, let me say how welcome
the minister is to our chamber, and how much
we have enjoyed and profited by his explanation. Section 2(a) of the bill reads:
two members of the Eastern Rockies Forest Conservation Board shall be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta in Council ...

I believe the minister said that the Governor in Council of Alberta would have the
right to appoint certain members to the board,
but the way the bill is drawn it would seem
to tell him that he shall do so and so. It
looks as though we were commanding the
Lieutenant Governor of Alberta in Council to
appoint two members, and I would fancy
that the proper phraseology would be that he
has the right to do it. It should not be a
direction. Perhaps there is some explanation for it.

SENATE
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, we

Hon. Mr. Winters: No, the personnel of the

are delighted today to welcome the Minister
of Resources and Development. I recall that
when I came here as a neophyte I was rather
alarmed at the prospect of addressing this
august chamber, but my honourable friend
has come here today and has discharged his
obligation in a way that has been most satisfactory to all of us.
I think this is one of the most useful
pieces of legislation that we could have
before us for consideration. I recall that
back in 1938 the government of the day and
the Department of Mines and Resources,
which I was more or less adequately looking after, had discussions with the Alberta
Government for this very purpose. The
eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, running through from the international boundary
to the northern boundaries of Alberta, was
at one time heavily covered with forest. The
headwaters of all the streams that flow down
on to the prairie regions are in that area.
There was very clear evidence at that time
that the devastation of the area by fire was
proceeding apace, and that unless preventive
steps were taken we could look forward to
the time when the whole region would be
denuded of forest cover and we would suffer
all the natural consequences.
Nothing is more important for our country
than sound ideas of conservation. But we
have been prodigal in the handling of our
wealth. I recall that many years ago a gentleman who was here as a diplomatic representative of one of the central European
countries, where conservation of natural
resources is understood and practised,
remarked to me "You have a very rich
country; but, if you do not mind my saying
se, you are a very wasteful people." And
that indictment was true. With the disappearance of the forest cover, the snows that
gather in the winter pour down the mountainsides in torrents when spring comes, and
create floods, erosion and other disastrous
effects.
I rose today simply for the purpose of
complimenting the minister and the government on bringing in this legislation. The
measure is very necessary, and one that this
house can fully support without any hesitation whatever.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
minister if the entire capital expenditure of
$6,300,000-not the cost of maintenance-is
to be borne by the federal government?
Hon. Mr. Winters: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Will the personnel of the
board be changed before the full expenditure
of $6,300,000 is made by the federal government?

board will not be changed until the whole of
the capital expenditure has been made.
In reply to the honourable senator fron
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) may I
say that, not being a lawyer, I am of course
bound to rely upon lawyers for the language
used in the bill. This phraseology is the same
as that used in the Act of 1947, section 4(1) of
which reads:
There is established for the purposes set forth
in this Act, a board to be known as the Eastern
Rockies Forest Conservation Board consisting of
three members, two of whorn shall be appointed by
the Governor in Council and one of whom shall be
appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta in
Council.

Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
the minister has explained that the purpose
of this measure is to protect the forest cover
on the eastern slope of the Rockies, the idea
being that the flow of water will be gradual
and steady instead of torrential. Would he
kindly state whether protection is to be
given against insects, over-cutting by lumbering interests, and, so on, and, in general how
the forest growth is to be protected?
Hon. Mr. Winters: In reply to the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw), I may say that the program is
largely one of building roads to provide
access for the rapid transportation of fire
fighting crews and equipment. Also, fire wardens' houses and fire watchers' stations are
to be constructed. In general, I think it is
fair to say that the program, is largely one of
prevention of forest fires.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, as
one who has been over a large part of the
territory in question and has a fair knowledge of it, I wish to say that I think this
measure is a very worthy one. The country
with many deep ravines, is very difficult to
travel through, and the plan to build roads
over which fire fighting crews and equipment may move rapidly is a very commendable one. The region comprises one of the
fastest growing timber areas in all of Canadla, and the cost of the protection will be
fully repaid in years to -come through
increasedi growth of timber.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The Dominion Government
is not in this field by right, is it? The provincial governments are usually responsible
for fire fighting and other forest protection.
Hon. Mr. Winters: That is my understanding
of it, honourable senators. An agreement has
been made between the federal government
and the Government of Alberta, whereby the
federal government will assist in the protection of a resource that belongs to the
province.

JUNE 23, 1952
Hon. Mr. Reid: I thought that Alberta was
so rich in oil that it did not need any assistance.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The waters flow over
more than one province-over the three
prairie provinces, in fact-so the Dominion
Government is interested.
Hon. Mr. Winters: Yes. I might say, honourable senators, that the basic reason why the
federal government sees fit to participate is
that the waters which rise in this area flow
across all three prairie provinces and are
an important factor in their economic life.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
the Northwest Territories Bill is before the
Banking and Commerce Committee, which
will be resuming its sitting when the Senate
rises this afternoon, and the departmental
officials who will be present to answer questions on that bill could also give any information that honourable senators may require
on the present bill. I do not know whether
information on it is required, but perhaps the
bill had better be referred to the committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not see any need for it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think it had better
be sent to committee. I move, honourable
senators, that the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CAPITAL REVISION BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading
of Bill 308, an Act to revise the capital structure of the Canadian National Railway Company and to provide for certain other financial
matters.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
when the motion for second reading of this
bill was before the house a few days ago I
was unable to be present. However, I read
the discussion with interest and I have a few
comments that I should like to make on the
bill. Had I been in my place when second
reading was given, as perhaps I should have
been, I would have made them then.
55708-33

The suggestion was made, I think, by our
honourable colleague from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), that it might have been
better if at the onset of financial trouble the
railroads had been allowed to go into bankruptcy; that we thus might have avoided the
disadvantages of public ownership of a railway system, and the public treasury might
not have suffered the losses it has sustained.
It is to that suggestion that I wish to direct
a few remarks.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I intervene to say
that my comment was that it might have been
just as well if these railways went through
the wringer and had the water squeezed out
instead of their debts being passed on to
posterity. That did not necessarily imply
that after bankruptcy they would not have
become publicly owned.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I certainly had no intention of colouring the remarks made by my
honourable colleague in any way; however,
I think it would have been impossible at
that time to have implemented the suggestion he now off ers as to the manner in which
this business should have been handled. It
is on that point that I wish to address the
house; and to do so it is necessary first to
give some history of railway development in
Canada.
The vast country of Western Canada was
at that time opening up; and, rightly or
wrongly, some 70 years ago, following the
entry of the Western provinces into the Canadian confederation the idea of the Canadian
Pacific Railway developed, and the company
received substantial grants of land and money
from the Government of Canada as well as
assistance in the construction of a substantial
part of the present C.P.R. main line in the
province of British Columbia. The government
of the day had instituted a very vigorous
immigration policy, and by the late 1890's
many thousands of immigrants were flowing
into the Prairie Provinces each year. It
looked at that time as if this condition would
continue indefinitely. A significant fact in
relation to the bill now before -us is that the
genesis of our railway problem, and the
extent to which the federal treasury has been
burdened, is due in large part to the strong
optimism during the years I am speaking of,
and to the system of guaranteeing of bonds
so prevalent in that period.
In 1903, as part of an arrangement made
with the Grand Trunk Railway Company of
Canada, the government built the National
Transcontinental
line from Moncton to
Winnipeg. If my memory serves me right,
the late Charles M. Hayes, who by the way
went down with the Titanic, was president
of the railway. At that time the Grand Trunk

SENATE

had all its branch lines in Ontario, and it was
given the short haul to North Bay, while the
Canadian Pacifie Railway got the long haul
to Winnipeg and all points beyond, to the
mountains. It was that fact which prompted
President Hayes of the Grand Trunk to
approach the government of the day with a
proposal that his railway be assisted in getting into Western Canada. As I have said,
the government, in the final analysis, had
undertaken to build a line from Moncton to
The Grand Trunk itself then
Winnipeg.
undertook to construct a line from Winnipeg
to Prince Rupert, and pledged its credit and
guaranteed securities to build that long
stretch of road.
While this venture was proceeding the
Mackenzie and Mann interests were busy too.
The first railway they built was in Manitoba,
from Gladstone to Dauphin, through a very
rich farming country. That road was built
under the new financing technique by which
the provincial government guaranteed the
bonds at so much per mile to cover the
cost of the road. This technique was then
extended to other lines which Mackenzie
and Mann were building in Saskatchewan
In addition, the Manitoba
and Alberta.
Government guaranteed financial assistance
to the Canadian Northern, as it was then
called, to take it to Port Arthur, at the
head of the lakes. As part of the consideration for this aid the Government of Manitoba
was to receive a substantial reduction in
freight rates on the movement of grain from
the prairies to the head of the lakes.
In addition to the assistance given to railways by provincial governments, the federal
government in 1914 guaranteed $45 million
to the Canadian Northern Railway to build
a line from Eastern Canada to Port Arthur,
to link up with the prairie line of the old
Canadian Northern. Further, the Government of British Columbia gave a guarantee
on the Canadian Northern line from the
Alberta-British Columbia border to Vancouver.
By 1918 the financial position of the railways was such that the oustanding guarantees
of the provincial and federal authorities had
to be honoured. The cost of construction
of the Grand Trunk Pacifie was much more
than had been estimated, and that system
was soon in financial difficulty. The Canadian
Northern also had its troubles, and by 1919
-as the honourable senator from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) will recall-the government of the day had to deal with the whole
problem.
What courses were open to the government? It could have let the Grand Trunk
go into bankruptcy and be sold; and there is
little doubt that the Canadian Pacifie Railway

would have been in the market to buy the
lines in Ontario. The Canadian Northern
Railway could have been allowed to go into
bankruptcy, with the result that the Manitoba Government would have had to take
over the section of the road in that province,
which it held as security for the bonds it
had guaranteed. The provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia would
have followed the same course, and we
would have had segments of a railway with
no connection or cohesion in management
whatsoever. In addition, the federal government was vitally interested by virtue of
having given a guarantee in 1914 for
$45,000,000. The upshot was that the government decided it was in the national interest to
take over the Grand Trunk, the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, and all the Canadian Northern lines
in both Eastern and Western Canada. So
the old Grand Trunk Railway disappeared,
and Mackenzie and Mann ceased to be
railway owners and operators in this country.
As the sponsor of the bill pointed out, it was
not until 1923 that the government determined to incorporate the Intercolonial Railway and the National Transcontinental lines
in a complete national system.
In the carrying out of this scheme there
was duplication, of course, and roads were
taken into the system which probably should
never have been built. I might mention as a
concrete illustration the line between Edmonton and Redpass Junction, in the mountains.

The Grand Trunk and the Canadian National
main lines paralleled each other for several
hundred miles, and after consolidation took
place one of them was torn up; but all the
vast expenditure on construction remained
in the capital structure of the Canadian
National Railways. I have often thought that
in 1923 there should have been a complete
revision of this capital structure.
What we are dealing with, as I said earlier,
is the climax of all the mistakes which resulted from the optimistic mood of forty or fifty
years ago. At that time it was believed there
would soon be traffie enough for all these
roads. I remember the predictions of enthusiasts that by 1930 Canada would have a population of twenty million, and we were urged
to prepare accordingly. This much can be
said with perfect truth, that the responsibility
for the railway situation which developed
was not due to the shortcomings of any one
political party, but to the optimistic spirit of
the times, the belief that we would be forever expanding, going up and up and on and
on, and that all these railways would be
required.
I wanted to say these few words in explanation of why proceedings in bankruptey were
not resorted to. It is not necessary to discuss

JUNE 23, 1952
the vicissitudes of the Canadian National
Railways from 1923 to the present time. I am
well aware that Sir Henry Thornton was not
without shortcomings, but he did a useful
work for the Canadian National Railways.
When the Grand Trunk and Grand Trunk
Pacifie systens were united with the Canadian Northern, the officers of the railroads
from the top to the bottom were in a state of
uncertainty, few of them knowing who would
have to go and who would stay. The great
achievement of Sir Henry Thornton was the
development of harmony and a magnificent
esprit de corps in all ranks of Canadian
National personnel. That accomplishment,
whatever may be said against him by way
of criticism, must stand to Sir Henry's credit,
because the promotion and development and
bringing to fruition of a spirit of harmony
andi co-operation in a great railway system
of this kind, with tens of thousands of
employees, is a matter of the first importance.
I trust my colleagues will forgive me for
having interjected these remarks on the third
reading of the bill, but I felt that it was of
some importance to place them on the record.
Hon. R. B. Horner: I had not intended to
speak on this motion, but in view of the
praise which the honourable senator from
Churchil (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has bestowed on
the late Sir Henry Thornton's achievements
in behalf of the national railways -and of
Canada, I cannot refrain from a few
comments.
I am not impressed by such achievements
as suddenly raising a man's pay from $5,000
to $15,000 a year and granting big salaries
to people whose main jobs seemed to be
giving away the property of the railroad. I
never approved of salaries of $30,000 a year
to men who were incapable of earning any
such amounts. The effect, I happen to know,
was the very reverse of encouraging esprit
de corps among the rank and file. It is true
that Sir Henry held an important position
at a high salary, and that he was interested
in propaganda-so much so that one of his
officials charged with handling it got $15,000
a year-but the propaganda carried on was
simply to advertise Sir Henry Thornton.
Some of the contractors with whom Sir Henry
had to deal are still living, but unfortunately
the very able man who was his deputy, and
was particularly well informed on what went
on at the time, has passed away.
Have honourable senators never heard of
the Decary house purchase?
What about
that forty-thousand dollar trip, pai.d for with
Canadian National money, to Kingston,
Jamaica, to invest $400,000 in a hotel on
which the company had no security but a
second mortgage? There was the case of
55708-33

an official in the Maritimes who received
a salary of $30,000 a year, and who, when
he refused to sign certain documents at the
direction of Sir Henry, was immediately
retired, and, although not entitled to any
pension, was granted $10,000 a year as a
retiring allowance. When some of us were
looking
into the matter, this
official
approached me and offered to forgo his
pension. I told him that if he would come
before the Railway Board and explain to us
all the circumstances concerning his retirement, including who was responsible for it, I
would, if the board thought he was entitled
to some retiring allowance, recommend a
pension in the amount of $5,000.
Such incidents as these come to mind
when we are told of the achievements of Sir
Henry Thornton. There is not an employee
of the road from one end of the country to
the other who does not know something of
the nonsensical actions of this grandiose
official.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I move the adjournment of the debate. It is
my experience that little has been recorded
either in the Senate or the House of Commons Hansard of the facts of the situation at
the time of the amalgamation of the railroads.
Honourable senators who are members of the
Banking and Commerce Committee will
remember that I asked the president of the
Canadian National certain questions and got
straightforward answers; but I have not yet
received my copy of the record. I want to
have those documents placed on Hansard, so
that I cannot be challenged as I was the
other day by certain gentlemen in this chamber. I have the answers and I shall place
them on record, and if there are any who
want to challenge them, they can do so. That
is why I want to adjourn the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
SAFETY ON THE GREAT LAKES
APPROVAL OF AGREEMENT
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved:
That it is expedient that the flouses of Parliament approve the Agreement for the Promotion of
Safety on the Great Lakes by Means of Radio between Canada and the United States of America,
signed at Ottawa, February 21, 1952, and that this
house do approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable member from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) to explain this
resolution.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, the
purpose of the resolution before the bouse is
to approve the Agreement of February 21,
1952 for the Promotion of Safety on the Great

SENATE

Lakes by Means of Radio. This agreement was
signed on behalf of the government of the
United States by the United States Ambassador to Canada and Commissioner W. E.
Webster of the Federal Communications Commission of the United States and on behalf
of Canada by the Honourable Lionel Chevrier,
Minister of Transport for Canada. The agreement is the culmination of negotiations
between Canada and the United States which
have extended over a period of some fourteen
years.
Basically this agreement constitutes formal
recognition of the fact that radiotelephony,
which enables direct communications between
vessels within a certain radius, as well as
from ship to shore, is superior to radiotelegraphy as a means of aiding navigation
and securing assistance in time of distress.
This is particularly true in congested and
restricted waters like the Great Lakes.
Negotiations were susupended for a time
owing to a variety of factors, such as the
shortage of radio equipment brought about
by the demands of the armed forces and
other essential services; however, in 1947
they were re-opened, and the document which
is now being recommended for approval by
this house was finally prepared at a conference held in Ottawa in 1951.
The existing law with respect to radio
installations on board ships on voyages on
the Great Lakes and other domestic waters,
as provided in the Canada Shipping Act, 1934,
and the Radio Regulations for Ship Stations,
has remained unchanged since 1939. Section
406 (2) (a) of the Act requires the installation
of radiotelegraph apparatus and the employment of a radio operator on passenger
steamships which fall within one of the three
following categories: (1) carrying 50 or more
persons and going on a voyage of more than
200 nautical miles; (2) carrying 250 or more
persons and going on a voyage of more than
90 nautical miles; (3) carrying 500 or more
persons and going on a voyage of more
than 20 nautical miles. In addition, section
406 (2) (b) requires cargo ships of 5,000
gross tonnage and over to carry radiotelegraph
apparatus, and a radio operator on voyages of
more than 200 nautical miles.
The Act permits the Governor in Council
to exempt cargo ships from the foregoing
requirement, such exemption being conditional upon the Governor in Council deeming
an installation to be unnecessary or unreasonable, and in 1940 advantage was taken
of the prerogative of the Governor in Council
to amend the regulations so as to permit
cargo ships of 5,000 tons gross tonnage and
upwards on the Great Lakes to carry radiotelephone apparatus in lieu of radiotelegraph
apparatus and an operator.

I shall now briefly explain the articles of
the agreement.
Article 1: The general provisions of the
agreement emphasize its purpose for the promotion of safety of life and property on the
Great Lakes, and that the regulations
annexed to the agreement are an integral
part thereof. At the same time, it is asserted
that nothing shall prevent the use of any
means at the disposal of a vessel or survival
craft to make known its position and obtain
help in case of distress.
Article 2: The various terms sued in the
agreement are defined.
Article 3: The agreement embraces the
area of the Great Lakes and the River St.
Lawrence to the lower exit of the Lachine
Canal and the Victoria Bridge at Montreal.
It does not include tributary rivers which
are not connecting rivers, and the Niagara
River. All passenger vessels over 65 feet in
length, and other vessels of 500 tons gross
tonnage, being navigated in this area outside
of a port will be required to carry radiotelephone apparatus. The provision with
reference to all passenger vessels over 65
feet in length is arbitrary in so far as Canada is concerned but I understand it conforms with the requirements of the United
States Motor Boat Act.
Also included under the compulsory
requirement of the agreement are vessels
under 500 tons gross tonnage engaged in
towing another vessel of 500 tons gross
tonnage, or over, unless the vessel being
towed is fitted with radiotelephone apparatus.
Ships of war, troop ships, vessels in tow,
vessels not self-propelled by mechanical
means-I take it that sailing vessels would
be excluded from the provisions of this
agreement-government vessels not engaged
in trade, and vessels towing other vessels
within 30 miles of a port, or vessels engaged
in movement of material between a port and
a dumping ground, within 30 miles from the
site of such operation, are exempt from the
requirements of the agreement.
Partial exemption applies to vessels of the
contracting governments, or ships of foreign
registry entering the lakes on a voyage from
outside ports on not more than two occasions
within the calendar year. Such vessels must,
however, meet the requirements of the International Convention for the Safety of Life
at Sea, 1948, with respect to radiotelephone,
such equipment to be adjusted to the international distress and safety frequency of
2182 kilocycles. Incidentally, the International Convention for the Safety of Life
at Sea, 1948, has not yet been ratified.
The foregoing embraces the acceptance of
the safety radiotelephone certificate which

JUNE 23, 1952
will be issued under the new safety of life
at sea convention and, in addition, provides
for the recognition in like manner of certificates issued by either Canada or the United
States to their own vessels on home trade
voyages and entering the lakes from below
Montreal.
Article 4 of the agreement provides that
a vessel which is not subject to the provisions
of this agreement shall not become subject
thereto due to stress of weather or other
cause of force majeure.
Article 5: The contracting governments are
obligated to ensure that a listening watch is
kept by coast stations on the distress
frequency.
Article 6: There is also a general exemption
clause permitting either contracting government to exempt vessels because of conditions
of the voyage, proximity to shore, absence
of navigational hazards, and so forth. Such
exemption is renewable each year.
Article 7: The agreement sets forth that
every vessel coming under the Act shall
carry, either as an officer or member of the
crew, at least one person qualified for radiotelephone operation and certified by either of
the contracting countries, each of whom certifies for its own citizens. This same section
obliges the masters of vessels to designate
one or more of such persons to operate the
radiotelephone installation, although it does
not limit his duties to this work only.
It is provided that there must be a continuous effective listening watch on the distress frequency by oral means, and that
where, through no fault of the master, the
vessel is deprived of the services of a certified person, the vessel may proceed on her
voyage as a temporary expedient. The master is, however, required to exercise due diligence to obtain a qualified replacement and
to notify his government of the circumstances.
Article 8: The radiotelephone installation required under the agreement must
be in effective operating condition and
approved as meeting the requirements set
forth in the regulations annexed to the agreement. Should it cease to be in effective
operating condition, the master must take
steps to repair any defects as quickly as
possible and, in any case, no later than the
arrivai of the vessel at the destination of
The master is required to
her voyage.
report such circumstances to his government
or, if the vessel is owned by a government
other than a contracting government, to a
contracting government at the vessel's destination or at the last port of call on the
Great Lakes.

Article 9: The agreement requires that
records shall be kept of the use of the radiotelephone installation for safety purposes.
Article 10 states that the master of the
vessel has supreme control over the radiotelephone installation and its operation, and
enjoins him to comply with the applicable
law and international agreements, and with
rules and regulations made pursuant thereto.
Article 11 provides for inspections and
annual surveys of all vessels.
In article 12 there is provision for the
issuance of certificates covering such inspections, which documents must be kept on
board the vessel for production to the officers
of either contracting government. A certificate issued by either of the contracting governments shall certify to the satisfactory
installation and operating conditions of the
radiotelephone apparatus.
According to article 13, either government may, if requested, survey a vessel and
issue a certificate on behalf of the other
government.
Article 14 specifies that a vessel carrying
certificates issued by either government is
subject to control by duly authorized officers
of either government, who may verify that
there is a certificate aboard and that the
apparatus complies in condition and operation with the particulars of the certification.
Article 15: Both countries are bound to
assist the vessels of countries other than
Canada and the United States in meeting
the requirements of the agreement.
Article 16 requires the contracting governments to exchange copies of certificates,
laws, regulations, reports, etc., with respect
to the operation of the agreement.
Article 17: The agreement is, of course,
subject to ratification, and does not come into
force until two years after the date on which
the instruments of ratification are exchanged.
Article 18: The agreement may be terminated by either government after five years,
the termination to be effective twelve months
after the date on which notification is
received by the government to which it is
addressed.
The regulations annexed to the agreement
are an integral part thereof, and by mutual
consent of the two governments may be
amended as becomes necessary to carry out
the provisions of the agreement.
The present regulations provide for the
technical specifications of the radiotelephone
installation. They require that the main
operating position for the radiotelephone
equipment shall be on the bridge, and that

SENATE
sufficient electrical energy shall be available for the operating thereof. Passenger
vessels of 1,000 tons gross tonnage or more
are, in addition, required to have available
an auxiliary source of energy to operate
the equipment in case of failure of the
vessels' electrical supply.
The regulations require that the 2,182 kilocycles frequency, designated as the international distress and calling frequency for
radiotelephone by the Radio Regulations,
Atlantic City, 1947, be fitted on all vessels.
There is also a requirement for an additional
frequency for inter-ship radiotelephone communication. The transmitter must be capable
of delivering at least 50 watts power to an
efficient antenna. The regulations specify that
the receiver is to be sensitive, and that the
equipment must be tested periodically to
ensure continued efficient operation; and a
record of the tests must be kept.
The requirements for the certificates of the
radiotelephone operators are set forth in the
regulations. Qualifications of operators on
board vessels of countries other than the
contracting governments may be accepted,
provided the operators are in possession of
certificates of proficiency issued under the
Atlantic City Radio Regulations.
The regulations specify in detail how the
records of use of the radiotelephone equipment for safety purposes shall be set up
and maintained.
Of the eleven passenger ships directly
affected by the agreement, three will require
no change in existing equipment, two must
obtain emergency power supplies, two will
require more powerful apparatus, and four
will be required to install radiotelephone.
As to eight other passenger-carrying vessels
operating as ferries or on restricted short
voyages, special consideration will be required
to determine whether exemptions are warranted under the exemption conditions of the
agreement. Of the 221 cargo ships plying
the Great Lakes and already fitted with
radiotelephone, 90 will be required to obtain
more powerful apparatus.
Equipment suppliers, I am informed, state
that the cost of an acceptable installation
on board ship runs from $880 to $1,400 when
purchased outright, the higher figure applying
to vessels requiring a reserve power supply.
Equipment may, however, be rented at an
annual cost of $470, including service and
maintenance charges.
Installation charges
usually run from $50 to $75.
While it is noted that many ships will be
required to replace low-power equipment or
install new equipment, it will be recalled that

the Dominion Marine Association, which
represents many of the shipping operators
concerned, was whole-heartedly behind the
agreement; and that, as a matter of fact, the
industry at one time talked of requiring all
ships on the Great Lakes, irrespective of size,
to be fitted with radiotelephone, because of
the very important safety factor resulting
from the ability of ship masters to converse
with one another in restricted waters.
Honourable senators, the agreement which
I have just reviewed applies to ships on the
Great Lakes. However, provisions for the
safety of life and property on waters anywhere are always of importance and interest
to those of us who live by the sea. Our minds
go back to the days of the sailing ship, when
the hazards were much greater than they now
are. The greatest perils then arose from winds
and storms. The loss of life on long sailing
voyages is evidence of the difficulties and
risks that had to be faced by our forefathers
when they sailed to this country, and afterwards when they made their living from the
sea. Throughout the years the sea took a
heavy toll of our men in the Maritime Provinces. It is interesting to note how conditions
have improved with the progress of science,
until today it is claimed that a ship is one
of the safest places where one can be.
In the olden days the dangers that confronted our seafaring men, in ships that
depended for their motion on the wind and
the weather, came principally from the
elements. Most of these dangers have been
overcome, and those which cause chief concern today are largely operational, arising
from fire and collision. The perils from these
sources too can be made less frequent by
discipline, vigilance, training, and the use of
scientific devices, among which the radiotelephone is one of the best. It is particularly
useful in congested and restricted waters such
as the Great Lakes.
We are all familiar with the differences
between the telephone and the telegraph:
each has its advantages. The telegraph system is the safer device by reason of the fact
that a record is made, and there is greater
secrecy; the telephone, on the other hand,
permits a conference between ships and from
ship to shore, and a conclusion can thus be
quickly reached. Deep-sea fishing vessels
from Lunenburg have for many years been
equipped with radiotelephones, and can be
in communication with their owners and the
families of the crews at any time. This is
important from a business standpoint; it also
makes the absent fishermen seem to be less
remote.
I have said that the telegraph furnishes a
record. Honourable senators will note that

JUNE 23, 1952
the agreement makes provision for a log,
which is to be kept as an official record of
telephone conversations, if one is needed.
It may interest honourable senators to hear
that the radiotelephone can transmit messages over salt water much farther than over
fresh water. From Lunenburg we can send
messages to the Grand Banks, and be in communications with vessels there. Halifax has
a strong station-over 1,000 watts-and we
sometimes transmit through it. The regulations under this resolution require a minimum of 50 watts for use on the Great Lakes.
In radiotelegraphy the distress signal is
S.O.S.; but in radiotelephony according, to
the final acts of the International Telecommunication and Radio Conferences held in
Atlantic City in 1947, the distress signal consists of the word "Mayday", the pronunciation of which is the same as that of the
French expression M'aider, meaning, I understand, "help".
The text that I have before me adds:
These distress signals indicate that the ship, aircraft, or other vehicle sending the distress signal is
threatened by grave and imminent danger and
requests immediate assistance.

In this instance, Canada and the United
States are making an agreement to invoke
the aid of scientific progress, through the use
of the radiotelephone, for the promotion of
safety on the Great Lakes. I am sure we al]
agree that this is a step forward. It is -an
example of science, coming to the help of
industry.
I was pleased to see in the chamber today
the Honourable Mr. Winters, Minister of
Resources and Development, who comes from
Nova Scotia and represents in the House of
Commons the same constituency that I once
represented in that house. It is unique, I
think, that we should be here together, and
that our remarks should appear in the Senate
Hansard of the same day.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to ask three
questions of the mover of this resolution.
First, why does a resolution of this kind
use statute miles instead of nautical miles?
Although, I realize that some installations
will be made on land, and will take care of
ships not more than thirty miles out at sea,
I am wondering why we must use the statute
mile of 5,280 feet instead of the nautical
mile of 6,080 feet?
Second, why are the regulations confined
to vessels of more than 1,000 gross tons?
They are compelled to have reserve energy
to properly handle radio telecommunication
installations, but certainly ships of six or
seven hundred tons are good-sized vessels.
My third question is, why has a resolution
as laudable as this one been held in abeyance
for so long after ratification of the agreement
by both countries?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: As to the use of statute
miles instead of nautical miles, I presume that
because the regulations will apply to inland
waters the authorities saw fit to describe
the distance in land miles. I believe that is
the custom on the Great Lakes.
The regulations are made to apply to ships
of more than 1,000 tons because vessels of
that size may be ocean-going vessels. In the
lakes reserve energy is more readily pro-curable than at sea. In all agreements such
as this an arbitrary line has to be drawn
somewhere, and in this instance it was drawn
at 1,000 tons.
As to my honourable friend's third question, I believe that a reasonable amount of
time was allowed to enable industry to
familiarize itself with the matter and to
prepare for the coming into effect of new
regulations.
The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was concurred in.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING POSTPONED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
this is the first of several pieces of legislation
which will come to us today. I had intended
earlier to ask the bouse to proceed with
second reading today; but, if honourable
senators agree, I should now like to suggest
that second reading be postponed until tomorrow. My reason for doing this is that a considerable number of witnesses are here in
connection with the Combines Investigation
bill, and I should not like to encroach on the
time for hearing them. I should like honourable senators to be prepared however to
consider tomorrow afternoon all the matters
which are then placed before us.
I therefore ask that second reading of this
bill be proceeded with at the next sitting of
the house.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
may I take this opportunity to say to the
government leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
something that I omitted to mention to him
before the house opened? Although there
may be exceptions, most of the legislation
which is coming to us-for instance, that
affecting war veterans-is non-contentious.
I would suggest, therefore, the bills could be
discussed most effectively, and that progress
would be more rapid, were they dealt with
in committee of the whole house. Personally
I should like to see all legislation before us
disposed of by Friday, so that if delays occur,
the other house, not ourselves, will be
responsible.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I have taken the precaution of asking certain of my colleagues to
explain measures yet to come before us, and
I personally am rather favourably disposed
to the suggestion of the honourable senator.
If a number of questions are to be asked,

there is nothing to prevent us from adjourning during pleasure and hearing statements
in committee. I am willing to be guided by
the views of the house.

GENOCIDE
PRIVILEGE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, and on a question of privilege,

I should like to call the attention of the house
to a letter written by Mr. N. T. Seymen,
the Ambassador of Turkey to Canada,
in which he objects to some remarks which
I made on May 27 last in connection with
the subject of genocide. With the permission of the house I should like to read
excerpts from his letter.
He writes:
In a remarkable speech delivered before the
Senate, Tuesday, the 27th day of May, 1952, the
Honourable Senator for Toronto-Trinity has uttered
certain appreciation of history which, in my opinion,
does not correspond with the true facts. I will
endeavour to explain myself on these points.
When Gladstone, as Chief of the British Parliamentary Opposition, threw himself into a furious
anti-Turkish campaign in 1875-76, such attitude truly
did not express the highly humanitarian sentiments
he was nourishing himself for a sacred cause, but
his motive was rather a vivid desire of fighting a
worthy adversary, that is to say Count Beaconsfield,
the policy of whom was frankly favourable to
Turkey. Gladstone's demagogie agitation under the
cover of disinterested idealism was only a manoeuvre of internal politics, of which Turkey has
from that time paid all the cost, so much so that,
seventy-five years after, the echoes of that unsettling agitation continue to reverberate between
the walls of the Honourable Senate of Canada.
In 1875 the Ottoman Empire had to face an insurrection fomented by foreigners and had, in order
to secure the maintenance of their own existence,
to break down the uprising movement which was
very seriously threatening their territorial and
Excesses were committed nu
political integrity.
doubt, as excesses are committed today; but to
that Gladstone's fantastie stateconclude therefrom
ments were veracious would be a deduction overcoming my faculty of comprehension and my ability
of producing fair and impartial judgment.

The writer concludes:
Why then condemn the one and absolve the other?
Would it not be wiser, after what Humanity has
lived through and has seen during this Twentieth
tury, to renounce such unprovoked charges
which perpetuate animosity and prevent the spirit
of peace and of friendship to reign between men
of good will?

With that sentiment, honourable senators, I
entirely agree, but I should like to call the

attention of the house to the exact words I
used on the occasion in question. They are

as follows:
As a young man I read with revulsion, as no
doubt you did, of the massacres of the Armenians,
in which more than a million people lost their lives.

I made no reference to Turkey, although
impliedly the reference is there. However,
having great respect for the Ottoman Empire,
and fully appreciating the humanitarian
qualities of the Turkish people, I would be
pleased to hear that the history which I think
we have generally accepted with regard to
the massacre of the Armenians is uncorrect.
I assure the house and the Ambassador that
I had no intention whatever of offending the
sensibilities of the Turkish people or their
representative in Canada. If, as I have
indicated, my account of history is shown to
be incorrect, I shall gladly withdraw my
remarks so far as they concern Turkey.

JUNE 24, 1952
I -extend to the Turkish people and their
representative in Canada my greetings and
my appreciation of the attitude taken by
them. Whether history is right or wrong, I
am pleased to see that modern Turkey objects
to the story which has been told in history
about the massacre of the Armenians. I
think it was Napoleon who once said that
history is a romance upon which we are all
agreed. I know now for the first time that
we are not all agreed on this particular point,

readily available to senators who thirty or
forty years from now may want to know
what facts were made available to the committee in the session of 1952. Otherwise,

of committee proceedings, and our successors would not have the benefit of it. We all

the Canadian Northern Railway, the Grand
Trunk Railway, and the Intercolonial had an
indebtedness on the lst of January, 1923,
when they commenced business as the Canadian National Railway, of $804,503,144.
Of course, in addition to that the Dominion
of Canada had spent $429,563,445.
If you will look at the examination of
Donald Gordon, President of the Canadian
National Railway, before the Banking and
Commerce Committee on Bill 308, on June
20, 1952, you will find that these figures are
covered in his answers to me. I then asked
him the following questions:
Hon. Mr. Haig: What liabilities were assumed by
the Canadian National Railways on the 31st of
December, 1922, or the lst of January, 1923, when
the road was started?
Mr. Gordon: The debts held by the public at the
time of consolidation-which I assume is what you
have in mind?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, sir.
Mr. Gordon: -which were assumed by the Canadian National Railway System totalled $804,503,144;
and in addition to that the government had spent
on Canadian Government Railways, which were included in the system, a total of $429,563,445.
Hon. Mr. Haig: During the years 1923 to December 31, 1951, what was the railway's total operating
revenue?
Mr. Gordon: The grand total operating revenue
from 1923 to 1951 was $9,009,111,688.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What were the total operating
expenses for the same period?
Mr. Gordon: $7,920,224,664.
That left what net operating
Hon. Mr. Haig:
profit?
The net operating profit was
Mr. Gordon:
$1,088,887,024.

Hon. Mr. Haig: How was that figure disposed of?
Perhaps I should put it another
Mr. Gordon:
way: that made available for payment of our fixed
interest a sum of $797.430,376. The difference between that amount and the $1 billion-odd which
I just mentioned represents sundry payments in the
form of rents, taxes and things of that kind. Perhaps I should complete the statement by pointing
out that our actual requirements, or rather what
we showed for fixed interest, was a total of
$1,377,564,270, which produced an income deficit over
the years we are talking about of a total of
$580,133,894.

I should add-what is not in the record but
was contained
statement-that

in Mr. Gordon's morning
this sum is equivalent to

$20,000,000 a year for twenty-nine years,
namely from January 1, 1923 to December
31, 1951.
Mr. Gordon was asked by me about the
write-offs in 1937. Chapter 22 of the statutes
of that year provided that $1,218,642,195.27
should be transferred out of the indebtedness
and adjustments of the Canadian National
system. By the present bill we are transferring a further indebtedness, in the amount

of $736,385,405, to the Government of
Canada. In other words, these amounts have
been written off as far as the company is
concerned, and charged to the taxpayers.
If you will look at the publication, issued
by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, of the
railway accounts as of December 31, 1951,
you will observe that, after all operating
revenue is taken into account, and operating
expenses, rent, taxes, etc are deducted, there
remains a total loss of $580,133,894. I am
stating these figures so that there can be no
misunderstanding about what the road has
actually cost,-as Mr. Gordon has said, about
$20,000,000 a year for the past twenty-nine
years.
I stated on second readng, and I repeat,
that Mr. Gordon's answer to my question,
whether he thought this provision would put
the road in a position to operate and pay
expenses, including interest owed each year
on the balance of the debt, was "yes". It is
true that he added, after questions by some
members, that of course it depended upon
economic conditions in the country, and
freight rates, which must be based on the
cost of wages and materials entering into
the operation of the road, but he felt that
this final write-off would put the company
in a position where it could put up a battle
to operate a successful corporation.
I may point out to the house that apart
from the write-off, which is a transfer of
the debt from the Canadian National Railway
to the Canadian taxpayer, there is the further
condition that, unless the company earns
enough to pay it, there wil be no interest
on $100 million, which remains outstanding,
in the next ten years.
Honourable senators, I support this bill
on the understanding given by Mr. Gordon,
that he is convinced that the road, given
reasonable freight rates, can be operated as
a going concern without any further demand
on the treasury of Canada. I hope this is
true, and I feel that the employees of the
Canadian National Railways will do their
part to make the road a success.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: Honourable senators, I

DIVORCE STATISTICS 1952
FINAL REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
at this time of the session, when the work of
the Standing Committee on Divorce has been
completed, it is usual for the chairman to
present a final report covering the work done
during the session. I have pleasure today in
submitting that report, which contains certain statistics and is similar to reports filed in
other years, particularly in 1951. It is not
usual to have the report adopted; it is merely
filed and printed in the record so that the
information it contains will be available to
the public.
With leave of the house, I shall now read
the report.
The Standing Committee on Divorce beg leave to
make their 325th report, as follows:
For the present session 372 petitions for bills of
divorce were presented to the Senate and dealt with
by the Standing Committee on Divorce, as follows:
313
Petitions heard and recommended ........
2
Petitions heard and rejected ...............
7
Petitions withdrawn .......................
50
Petitions not proceeded with ...............
372
Total .....................................
Of the petitions recommended during the present
session of parliament, 89 were by husbands and 224
were by wives.
Of the petitions recommended, 3 were from petitioners domiciled in the Province of Newfoundland
and 310 were from petitioners domiciled in the
Province of Quebec.
The committee held 41 meetings. On 29 days the
committee functioned in two sections.
In 20 cases the committee recommended that part
of the parliamentary fees be remitted.
The fees paid to parliament for bills of divorce
heard and recommended during the session of 1952
amounted to $63,730, being approximately $5,040
more than in 1951.
As'uming that all bills of divorce recommended
by the committee, now in various stages before
parliament, receive Royal Assent, the comparison
of dissolutions of marriage granted by parliament
in the last ten sessions is as follows:

Hon. Mr. Grant: It is getting worse.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Last year the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) asked me what were the religious
affiliations of those receiving parliamentary
divorces, and I was unable to give him an
accurate answer. This year the clerks of the
committee have kept a full account of this
information, so this year I am able to supply
that information.
The religious denomination of the petitioners and
respondents for the present session is as follows:

Your committee makes the same recommendation
that it made in the 1950 and 1951 reports. It regrets
that parliament has not seen fit to solve the problem
of parliamentary divorce by setting up suitable
courts or tribunals before which the numerous
cases from Quebec and Newfoundland could be
heard. It is to be hoped that something will be done
in that regard in the near future.
All which is respectfully submitted.

Honourable senators, having presented my
report, I should like to make a few general
remarks without going into the matter of
divorce as fully as I did last year. If honourable senators care to read the debates of the
first session of 1951, at pages 648 and following, they will find there my ideas and suggestions on the various phases of this question.
I do not intend to repeat those thoughts
today.
Perhaps I should comment on one suggestion I made last year as to the printing of the
reports of the committee. As honourable
senators know, some 400 copies of each report
are printed. These, except for a few extra

SENATE
copies which go to the litigants, are distributed to the members of the other house
and members of the Senate. I was of the
opinion that perhaps something could be saved
by printing, say, only 50 copies, because it
seems that many of the members of the House
of Commons do not read the reports anyway.
I am informed, however, that the cost of
printing 400 copies is very little more than
the cost of setting the type for and printing
one copy. I understand that the additional
copies involve only about one extra hour of
labour and the small cost of the paper used.
So, apparently little could be saved by printing fewer copies.
I dealt last year with the supreme jurisdiction of parliament, the care that the committee
taken in dealing with the custody of children,
the costs of parliamentary divorces, the
Mclfleaus Bill of 1938, the suggestion that a
Royal - ommission should be appointed to
deal with this whole question, and the delay
in passing bills through the other bouse. I
am pleased to note that this year the delay
there has been largely eliminated and that
the bills were dealt with as they arrived. In
that way there was not the usual pile-up
which has occurred in previous years.
Before concluding, I should like to sincerely
thank the legal members of the committee for
the support they have given me throughout
the session. During the first month we sat
six days a week; following the Easter recess
we sat Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays; and
during the past month we sat only on Mondays
and Fridays.
There was not one occasion
when we lacked a quorum, and there was
always a legal member from the chamber
to act as chairman, even when the committee
sat in two sections. On Fridays and Mondays
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) assisted. We also had such able
chairmen as the honourable senators from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), Carleton (Hon.
Mr. Fogo) and Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross).
All of these gentlemen gave valuable assistance, but we could not have carried on
but for the faithful attendance of laymen on
the committee-men like Bill Golding, R. B.
Horner, Jack Stevenson, Dr. Howden, Dr.
Gershaw J. J. Kinley, A. B. Baird, and George
H. Barbour. There are some whom I cannot
unreservedly congratulate-the honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)An. Hon. Senator: And Waterloo?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Order.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: -and perhaps also the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.

Euler)-although when we were badly in need
of additional members we could depend on
them. In general, the members of the committee faithfully attended day affter day. Again
let me compliment them and tell them that
without their assistance it would have been
absolutely impossible to have got through al
this work.
I also wish to express my thanks to the
Chief Clerk of Committees and his assistants
for their valuable co-operation, without which
we would not have been able to continue the
work day after day. Nor must I forget the
members of the Reporting Staff, who attended
the hearings to take down the evidence, and
who, with their amanuenses, worked long
hours in transcribing their notes and preparing the copy for the printers.
As is generally known, I intended to vacate
the chairmanship last year, but so much
pressure was brought to bear upon me after
the Christmas recess that I decided to continue in the position for another year, in the
hope that some change would be made which
would remove these duties from parliament
altogether.
There is one other matter to which I
would refer before I resume my seat. The
judges of our courts, no matter what their
religious beliefs may be, hear and decide
divorce cases. I believe that any member of
this chamber, whether he belongs to the
Roman Catholic, the Anglican, or any other
church which is opposed to divorce, should
be ready to take part in this work, and I
include non-lawyer senators as well as lawyers. It is every senator's duty to sit on any
committee to which he is appointed, and
I do not think that religious beliefs should
be accepted as a reason for non-participation. If, therefore, the Senate is required
again next year to deal with these matters,
it is to be hoped that members of the faiths
I have mentioned will do their part.
If there are any questions I shall do my
best to answer them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I would like to know from
the honourable senator-who, I think, has
done a very good job indeed-whether he
bas some suggestion to make as to how
parliament could be relieved of this work.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I did not repeat the
substance of what I said on this matter last
year, because I then stated that on various
occasions J had given my views.
I have
been a member of this committee since 1934,
and perhaps I was the first person to suggest that these divorce petitions be trans-

JUNE 25, 1952
ferred to the Exchequer Court; at any rate,
I raised the point shortly after I became
a member of the committee. I have also
suggested that a proctor or a committee of
proctors be appointed to take the evidence in
these cases so that senators would not be
obliged to sit for hours at a time six days
a week in the committee room downstairs
listening to witnesses. The proctor or proctors could take the testimony and recommend
whether the petition should be granted or
not; then the Divorce Committee could sit
as a sort of court of appeal and, in cases
where it saw fit, bring in bills of divorce
and have them passed through parliament
in the usual way. Apparently that suggestion
did not meet with the approval of the government. Apart from that and the other suggestion I mentioned, and the recommendation that a royal commission be appointed to
investigate the whole question of divorce,
including parliamentary divorces, I have no
solution to offer.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
the leader of the house (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
is absent for a few minutes, but I do not
think he would want me to let this occasion
go by, and I am sure the Senate would not
want it to pass, without an expression of our
very deep appreciation of the work done by
the Divorce Committee, and particularly by
the chairman of that committee.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think we all realize
-and the statement which the chairman has
just made emphasizes the point-that the
work done by the members of the committee
is most exacting and most unpleasant. We
owe them a great debt of gratitude for taking
on themselves this duty, which unfortunately,
under present conditions, this branch of parliament is called upon to perform.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear hear.
Hon. Mr. Grant: I would like to say one
word. The chairman of the Divorce Committee brought up a question of religion: he
stated that Catholics should serve on this
committee if they were asked to do so. I
just want to say that if every member of this
body were a Catholic that would be
the solution-there would be no divorce
committee.
INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY

Hon. Mr. Farris, Acting Chairman, presented the report of the Standing Committee

Act to amend The International Boundary
Waters Treaty Act.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to which was referred Bill 333, an Act
to amend The International Boundary Waters Treaty
Act, have in obedience to the order of reference
of June 17, 1952, examined the said bill, and now
beg leave to report the same without any amendment.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Doone presented and moved concurrence in the report of the Special Committee appointed to inquire into the sale and
distribution of salacious and indecent literature in Canada, as follows:
The Special Committee appointed to inquire into
the sale and distribution of salacious and indecent
literature in Canada begs leave to report, as follows:
1. In obedience to the order of reference of May

enthusiastic approval
Social, civic and business organizations in all parts
of Canada commended your committee on the work
in progress. The press gave a generous and sustained support in publicizing proceedings. Your
committee wish to extend its keen appreciation to
ail co-operating in its efforts.
2. Through the testimony given and through
communications received your committee has been
made abundantly conscious of the seriousness of
the problem under investigation and the timeliness of the inquiry. Minutes of proceedings which
are available for distribution give arresting proof
of these features.
3. Your committee at its inception realized that
the time factor and available facilities would be
deterrents to a complete survey during the present
sitting of parliament. The energy and co-operation, however, of the reportorial and stenographic
staffs made a gratifying progress possible, but time
did not permit of an exhaustive or comprehensive
study. Many organizations, national in character,
expressed a desire to be heard after conventions planned for the summer months. Distributors also wish to give testimony. For these
reasons no definite findings can be reported at this
time.

SENATE
4. Your committee, therefore, recommends that
at the earliest possible date, during the next
session of parliament, a committee similarly constituted be appointed to carry on the investigation
authorized under the present order of reference.
The enthusiasm and interest exhibited by the
people of Canada in the aims of your committee,
and the importance of the inquiry from the standpoint of national good, emphasize the necessity of
reaching conclusions from which corrective measures may be taken. Such measures should be
instituted with a minimum of delay.

The motion was agreed to, and the report
was adopted.
MARINE

AND

AVIATION
BILL

SUBJECT MATTER REFERRED

WAR

RISKS

TO COMMITTEE

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), I wish to move:
That the Banking and Commerce Committee be
authorized to examine the subject matter of Bill
336, an Act respecting Marine and Aviation War
Risks Insurance and Reinsurance Agreements, presently before parliament, in advance of the said
bill reaching the Senate, and that the said committee be authorized to send for persons, papers and
records.

I have a similar motion in precisely the
same phraseology with respect to a second
bill.
As these two bills have not yet reached this
house, it would appear that if we wish to
reach an early prorogation of parliament it
will be necessary for us to adopt the same
policy adopted towards the end of other
sessions, and to consider the subject matter
of bills even though the bills have not yet
formally come before us. If these two resolutions are adopted and the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce gives consideration to the subject matter of these bills,
the only remaining legislation to come before
this house will be the Redistribution Bill and
the legislation to provide pensions for members of the other bouse.
The motion was agreed to.
CURRENCY, MINT AND EXCHANGE FUND
BILL
SUBJECT MATTER REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the leader of the government,
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), I move:
That the Banking and Commerce Committee be
authorized to examine the subject matter of Bill 390,
an Act respecting Currency, the Royal Canadian
Mint, and the Exchange Fund, presently before parliament, in advance of the said bill reaching the
Senate, and that the said committee be authorized
to send for persons, papers and records.

The motion was agreed to.

NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF PROTOCOL

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament
do approve the protocol to the North Atlantic
Treaty, signed at Paris on May 27, 1952, extending
the guarantees of Article 5 of the Treaty to the
European Defence Community, and that this house
do approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators, this resolution, which is similar to one already adopted
by the other place, seeks approval by the
Senate of a document known as a protocol
to the North Atlantic Treaty. I do not think
I need read this protocol in detail. It has
already been circulated among all honourable
members, but in order to enable them to
appreciate its import, I should like to refer
to the North Atlantic Treaty itself, which was
approved by this parliament three years ago.
The parties to the North Atlantic Treaty
were the United States, Great Britain,
Canada, France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg,
and the Netherlands. I think the nub of the
whole treaty is to be found in Article 5, which
reads as follows:
The Parties agree that an armed attack against
one or more of them in Europe or North America
shall be considered an attack against them all; and
consequently they agree that, if such an armed
attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right
of individual or collective self-defence recognized
by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,
will assist the Party or Parties so attached by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the
other Parties, such action as it deems necessary,
including the use of armed force, to restore and
maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

As was pointed out at the time, Article 5
of the North Atlantic Treaty meant, so far
as Canada was concerned, that we became
responsible with all the other countries parties to the treaty for defence against any
attack made upon any one of those countries.
Then a few months ago, as the house will
recall, Greece and Turkey became parties to
the North Atlantic Treaty, and the provisions
of the treaty with regard to attacks upon
them are expanded to include those countries,
and Article 6 of the treaty was amended to
incorporate the territorial limits of Greece
and Turkey. Article 6, which immediately
follows Article 5, now reads thus:
For the purpose of Article 5, an armed attack on
one or more of the parties is deemed to include an
armed attack(i) on the territory of any of the parties in
Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France, on the territory of Turkey or on
the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the
parties in the North Atlantic area north of the
Tropic of Cancer;
(ii) on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of
the parties, when in or over these territories or any
other area in Europe in which occupation forces of
any of the parties were stationed on the date when

JUNE 25, 1952
the treaty entered into force in the Mediterranean
Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic
of Cancer.

The present protocol which amends and
extends the North Atlantic Treaty arises out
of the meeting at Lisbon last spring of the
members of the North Atlantic Council. Honourable senators are well aware of what
transpired at the Lisbon meeting. As a result
of that meeting three vitally important steps
were taken for the furtherance of the defence
of the western hemisphere.
The first was the signing, on May 26, in
Bonn, Germany, by the Foreign Ministers of
the United Kingdom, the United States, and
France, on the one hand, and by the Chancellor of the German Federal Republic, on
the other, of an agreement comprising a convention on relations between the three Great
Powers and the German Federal Republic,
with a lot of related documents. That, in
effect, was the treaty of peace between the
German Federal Republic and those three
Great Powers. I do not think the house will
expect me to go into the details of that agreement, which are very long and very complicated, but perhaps I should point out that
under that treaty the Government of Germany undertakes, by article 4, to participate
in the European Defence Community, in order
to contribute to the common defence of the
free world. So much for the peace contract
with Germany.
The second very important thing that was
accomplished as a result of the Lisbon conference was the signature in Paris, on the 27th
of May, of a treaty establishing the European
Defence Community. By the provisions of
that treaty the governments of France, Italy,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and
the German Federal Republic agree to set
up a European army, purely defensive in
character, which will be under the operational
command

of

the

North

Atlantic

Treaty

Organization Commander. Within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty this new
treaty seeks to ensure the security of the
states which have signed it. Honourable
senators will realize from the list of the
countries members of the European Defence
Community, which I have read, that they comprise all the European members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization plus the German
Federal Republic.
The third very important thing which
resulted from the Lisbon conference was the
signature, on May 27, in Paris of this protocol
to the North Atlantic Treaty, the protocol

which we are now asked to approve. Article
1 of this protocol reads:
An armed attack
(1) on the territory of any of the members of the
European Defence Community in Europe or in the
area described in Article 6(i) of the North Atlantic
Treaty,

which I read a moment ago.
or (ii) on the forces, vessels or aircraft of the
European Defence Community when in the area
described jn Article 6 (ii) of the said treaty,

which I also read a few moments ago
shall be considered an attack against all the
parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, within the
meaning of Article 5 of the said treaty, and Article
5 shall apply accordingly.

In practice, what that means to us in
Canada is this. By this protocol we extend
our commitments and consider an attack on
the German Federal Republic as an attack
upon ourselves, under Article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, just in the same way as
we now consider an attack upon Greece or
Turkey or France or any of the other
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization as an attack upon ourselves. I
do not deny, honourable senators, that this
is a most important extension of our international obligations.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if West Germany
has agreed to this?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: These are all, in the
stages in which the governments have agreed
to them, subject to ratification by their parliaments.
Perhaps, however, this extension of our
liabilities is not quite so large as might appear
at first glance, because Canada already has
forces stationed in West Germany, and under
Article 6 (ii) of the North Atlantic Treaty,
which I read a few moments ago, we already
have to consider as part of the territories in
whose defence we must participate in case
of attack, any territories in which our occupation forces are situated.
That is Article 1 of the protocol.
Article 2 of the protocol states that the
protocol shall come into force as soon as each
of the parties bas notified the Government of
the United States of America of its acceptance,
and the Council of the European Defence
Community has notified the North Atlantic
Council of the entry into force of the treaty
setting up the European Defence Community.
Honourable senators, in substance that is
the purport of this protocol which extends
the international commitments of Canada, and
indeed of all the other members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, to include an
attack upon the territory of the federated
state of Germany.

SENATE

This protocol may be described, perhaps,
as one of the stones in the building which the
Western democracies are in process of erecting
in an attempt to protect themselves against
the possibility of attack from Soviet Russia.
This protocol which we are now asked to
approve, and the other agreements and treaties
to which I have referred, mark the response
of free men to the threat of a common danger,
they offer a reasoned hope that in union will
be strength.
I do not think I should stop there, however,
without pointing out to the Senate that we
must not lose sight of the fact that as yet
these are merely agreements on paper, and
there will be much to do before they are
translated into the realities of effective
defence.
I understand that the Parliament of Canada
is the first parliament which is being asked
to give its approval to this protocol. Ratification of all these agreements is the next step.
As the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) pointed out, they
will of course have to be approved by the
parliaments of the different countries concerned, and that may be a long and perhaps
a difficult process. But it is expedient that
the impetus towards European integration
within the Atlantic community to which these
agreements have given rise, should not now
be weakened. That is the reason why the
Senate is now being asked to approve this
protocol.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
do not intend to oppose the resolution; in fact,
I am in favour of it. I have, however, one
or two observations to make.
First, we must realize that Canada is taking
on a further obligation. Conditions of the
world are no better-indeed, they may even
be worse-than they were when we assumed
the original obligation under the Atlantic
Treaty Organization. I am sure I speak for
the majority when I say that we understand
that by this protocol we are making an agreement with the forty million people of Western
Germany, a strong, willing and hard-working
race, ready to rehabilitate themselves, and
that we are inviting them to join our United
Nations Organization.
We are somewhat in the sarne position
today as we were in 1942, when Germany
declared war on Russia. We then had to
decide which of the two countries we would
support; and along with the United States
and the United Kingdom we chose to support
Russia in her defence against Germany. Again
we are now making a choice: we would rather
have Germany in our circle than Russia.
Perhaps I am putting the whole set-up on
too simple a basis, but in the long run that is

what it gets down to. Personally, I would
rather have Germany on my side than Russia.
I know that the German people who have
settled in Canada have, with few exceptions,
made very fine citizens.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
can understand how the German people were
led into two world wars, for they are more
susceptible to leadership of the wrong kind
than are the people of many other nations we
know of. I am wholeheartedly in support of
the resolution.
I have one other thought, though it may
seem to be drawing one nation in by the heels.
I do not like the criticism of the United
States that is coming from some of the free
nations because she has made a major attack
on North Korea, and the demand by those
nations that they be consulted. We all know
that 95 per cent of the United Nations' effort
in Korea comes from the people of the United
States.
Sone Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
not been for the actions of the United States,
we would now be slaves of Russia. As a
Canadian and a member of the Senate of
Canada, with all the responsibility that carries, I say that we should stop sniping at the
United States and stop challenging her strategy in Korea, unless we are prepared to
step in and support her, soldier for soldier.
You and I know the people of the United
States, and we know that in spite of their
little quirks and follies they are fundamentally as strong for freedom as we are. Indeed,
they fought one of the most bitter civil
wars in the history of the world over that
very issue, and the effects of it have not yet
died out in their country. We as Canadians
ought to be thankful that we have such
people as our neighbours.
If I may digress once again, I may say
that those of us who were in committee
this morning heard of the work being done
by the International Joint Commission, a
body composed of representatives of Canada
and the United States. The fact is that from
1911 to date the members of that commission
have settled all questions but one which have
come before them. Only once in forty-one
years have they failed-and one man said
that it was a good thing they did not try
to use force to reach agreement at that
time.
I congratulate the honourable deputy leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) on
his address. He bas, I think, stated the case
fairly. I wholeheartedly support his position,
and I ask him to support my stand that we,

JUNE 25, 1952
as Canadians, are not being fooled by what
is happening; we are not entering into this
agreement merely to make good fellows
of ourselves. We are joining with other
nations in this treaty in the full knowledge
that your boy or my boy may some day
be called upon to defend our cause and carry
out the promises we are now making. Fully
realizing that tremendous responsibility, I
am sure that every Canadian would rather
face the issue before us than be subjugated
and suffer the domination of Russia as
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Roumania have
done.
If any one needs further evidence of
Russia's domineering attitude, just let him
attend the meetings of the United Nations
for a couple of months, and I defy him to
come away with any other feeling than
that Russia is out to destroy peace and good
will in the world today. If simple-minded
people need to be persuaded that the
acceptance of Russia's propaganda would not
bring peace, let them explain why it is that
as soon as a country falls under communistic
domination it launches an attack against
the representatives in that country of religious denominations from other countries.
No one can convince me that the Christian
missionaries in China and other communistic
countries are bad people. They are more
willing than most of us to sacrifice their lives
to spread the gospel. It is these people who are
the first to be attacked. That is the policy
today in China, as it has been in Europe,
whenever and wherever the Communists gain
control. In religion lies the only hope of salvation for the world, and while I have
nothing but praise for the way in which
the United States, Great Britain, France
and other countries are preparing for the
struggle which may be ahead, unless mankind
believes in a higher power, all these defensive
measures will be of little avail. It is because
Russia knows the real source of the power
opposed to her that these attacks are going on.
I welcome the action of the government
in coming to the assistance of Germany,
as I am sure the German people will stand
100 per cent behind the undertaking.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CAPITAL REVISION BILL
THIRD READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the third reading of Bill 308,
an Act to revise the capital structure of the
Canadian National Railway Company and
to provide for certain other financial matters.

Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, it
is not my desire to prolong this discussion or
to occasion further debate on the bill which
is before us. We had an opportunity on the
20th of this month, in the Banking and Commerce Committee, to meet and hear Mr.
Gordon, president of the lines which we now
know as the Canadian National Railways. I
think the outcome of the meeting was highly
satisfactory to members of the committee.
Mr. Gordon was careful. He made no great
promises. He indicated his belief that under
the present proposed financial set-up the railway could, in the next few years, not only
justify its building and its use, but show a
profit. That of itself must be encouraging
to the people of Canada.
I have read the debate in the other place,
and have tried to familiarize myself with
the spirit and the opinion of the members
there. One may fairly say that there was a
feeling that the government, in the bill presented to parliament, was doing what should
be done in the matter o! this great problem
which bas faced the Canadian people. That
being so, there is no great advantage in prolonging the discussion.
I wish only to say one thing, and I do so
because we here are of faiily mature age,
and many of us remember when the proposals for the present system were made in
the House of Commons and in the provincial
legislatures, and how they were received.
Many people were then optimistic enough to
pledge not only the credit of the dominion
but also of the provinces. They may have
been wrong or their confidence may have
been misplaced. However, I am not of that
opinion. I think that these railways should
be looked upon as an embodiment of the
pioneering spirit of the Canadian people.
Fifty years ago, as we know, the Canadian
Pacific Railway received a charter, with the
moderate subsidy of $11,000 a mile, to build
the Crowsnest Pass line shortly after the construction of the main line of the railroad.
Everyone is aware of the great development
which followed in' that section of British
Columbia and of the wealth which has been
produced there. So, although to ordinary
individuals the millions of dollars which were
required to build, amalgamate and bring
under one management the Canadian National
Railways seem startling when set out in print,
I believe they were the best investment the
people of Canada could have made, and that
in the course of a very few years the expenditure will have been justified.
It may be that the railway age bas passed.
That seems to be so in some countries. But
in the broad domain from Halifax, say, to

SENATE

Vancouver, railways will always be necessary for certain kinds of traffic. No doubt
the railways will suffer greatly through the
advent of motor traffie and good highways,
and as we read today of great bodies of men,
with arms and supplies, being moved long
distances to the battlefields, we get some
indication of the commercial possibilities of
air transportation. It follows that the airlines
will be highly competitive with the railways.
But as Canada grows and develops, rail
transportation will continue to be needed,
and I am satisfied that we as a people have
made no mistake in amalgamating these railways and making them the property of the
Canadian people. So, I repeat, it is my
belief that the course taken and the policy
of the government under this bill will justify
what has taken place heretofore in regard
to these matters.
Hon. J. W. Siambaugh: Honourable senators, I heartily agree with what the honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King) has just said with regard to our
national railways. I believe they have paid
this country good dividends through their
management and the contribution they have
made to the building up of Canada. I am
in hearty agreement with this bill for the
recapitalization of the Canadian National
Railways, and I am only sorry that this
course was not taken years ago.
One ef my chief reasons for speaking
today is to comment on some statements
which were made last Monday in the debate
on this bill by the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). When honourable senators have heard what I have to
say, they will realize that I disagree very
much with the honourable senator's opinion
of Sir Henry Thornton. I know something
about how these railroads were built. I
helped to build them. I worked on the old
Canadian Northern and on the grade of the
Grand Trunk Pacifie; I have also worked
on several branch lines of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. I know that the Canadian
Northern was built in a manner which was
not proper. I learned, not at the time but
later on, that in many cases the grades were
too sharp for fast traffie. To build a grade
which will carry heavy traffic you cannot just
pile dirt on top of the sod, because the sod
will rot, and if the grade is low, the sod
must be removed. On the Canadian Northern Railway we piled up as little as a foot of
dirt on the top of the sod, and we dug
ditches right down tight to the roadbed. So,
when heavy traffic came over it there was
no "berm" to hold it; it settled down and
spread out. That was the condition of the
Canadian Northern Railway.

On the Grand Trunk Pacifie it was different. Where the fill was low, we had to
remove a foot of sod off the top of the
ground. Sometimes we wasted this away and
sometimes we put it into the deeper fills. The
curves on the Grand Trunk Pacifie were
made to handle fast traffic, the top being
sixteen feet wide rather than fourteen feet.
That road was well built. Perhaps it cost
too much money; I cannot say as to that.
I can say, however, that the G.T.P. roadbeds
I worked on were properly built, the curves
not being too sharp.
I am giving this information to illustrate
the condition of the railroad when Sir Henry
Thornton took over. It was a conglomeration
of bankrupt, inefficient and un-co-operative
railways without any one head. The morale
of the employees of the railroad was at about
as low an ebb as possible. Under Sir Henry's
management, -the railway became a single,
efficient operating system, a worthy conpetitor of the C.P.R., and at the time of his
resignation, the morale of the employees from
sectionmen to superintendents was the highest in its history. I do not know a single
employee of the C.N.R. who does not hold the
memory of Sir Henry Thornton in the highest
esteem. In the stations at all main terminals
on the line plaques are to be found that have
been erected in his memory by the employees
of the C.N.R. Each year groups of employees
places wreaths on these plaques. Certainly
this is proof that they honour and respect his
memory. I never saw the president of a
corporation or institution who was held in
such high esteem by his employees. Unfortunately, because of the load of debt under
which the Canadian National laboured, no
amount of management could meet the operating expenses and pay the fixed charges.
At this time I should like to place on record
something of the history of Sir Henry Thornton. To begin with, he was a civil engineer,
and his first experience in railroading was
gained
on
the Pennsylvania
Railroad.
Immediately preceding his appointmen't to
the Canadian National Railway, Sir Henry
was general manager for eight years of the
Great Eastern Railway in England, a position
which he occupied with distinguished success.
During his railway service in the Old
Land, Sir Henry gained the reputation of
being one of the ablest and most eminent
railway executives in Great Britain. Even
before that he had shown great executive
ability. In 1916, he was Deputy Director of the
Department of Inland Water Transportation,
which handled all the inland navigation in
northern France, Egypt and Mesopotamia. In
1917, he was appointed Deputy Director
General of Railways, with headquarters in

JUNE 25, 1952
Paris, and in this capacity he represented the
British, French, Italian and United States
governments in matters relating to transporta-tion. In 1918, he was promoted to the
position of Inspector General of Transportation and had full charge of all army transportation on the European continent.
During Sir Henry's residence in Britain be
becaýme a naturalized British subject, and was
knighted for his war work by the British
Government. He was also honoured by other
nations, receiving the Legion of Honour from
France, the Order of Leopold from Belgium,
and the Distinguished Service Medal from the
United States.
I should like to make one further observation about the operation of the Canadian
National Railways before the time of Sir
Henry Thornton. Years ago I was an employee
of a grain company, and together with another
person I was asked to inspect five grain elevators which were up for sale on the Canadian
Northern Railway line. The party who owned
these elevators was also interested in another
business, where he thought he could use his
money to greater advantage. We found that
the business of these elevators was good, and
that the district in which they were located
was putting more acreage in grain every year
and that business promised to get better and
better. The elevators had been properly constructed and were in excellent condition. We
made our report, and the manager of the
grain company said to us, "Well, boys, the
only thing I have against these elevators is
that they are on the Canadian Northern Railway. If they were on the C.P.R. I wouldn't
hesitate to buy them". That same company
used to ship grain over the Canadian Northern
to Camrose and then over C.P.R. to the head
of the lakes. That is just an illustration of
the conditions under which the Canadian
Northern was operating when Sir Henry took
over. But this sort of thing was all over
and done with before he resigned. The same
manager of this grain company-and incidentally he later bought those five elevators
-told me that the operation of the Canadian
National was equal and in some cases superior to that of the Canadian Pacific. I just
wanted to give the house something of Sir
Henry's record.
At the time of Sir Henry Thornton's death,
A. F. Whitney, who was president of one of
the great national unions of the federation of
railwaymen in the United States, said:
The more than 2,000,000 railway employees in the
United States and Canada were most deeply grieved
to learn that their friend. and the friend of the
common people generally, Sir Henry Thornton, had
been suddenly called from our midst ... The efforts
and accomplishments of his life are an indestructible monument of service and friendship to society

generally.

S. J. Hungerford, Acting President of the
Canadian National Railways, at the time of
Sir Henry Thornton's death, said:
Officers and employees, regardless of their position, join me in expressing regret at the passing of
Sir Henry Thornton. He inspired confidence and
loyalty in those who worked with him, and he was
as much interested in the welfare of the humblest
worker as in that of the highest officers.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable members, I would remind the house that if the
honourable the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) speaks now the debate
will be closed. Any honourable member who
may wish to speak on the motion before the
house should do so now.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, before
the leader of the government closes the debate
I wish to say how pleased I am that the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), notwithstanding the remarks he made on a previous occasion, has placed on record his
approval of this bill. He has quoted figures
which were given to the Committee on Banking and Commerce last Friday, and confirmed
figures already on record. I am indeed pleased
that the leader of the opposition has given
his approval to this refinancing.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I have nothing to add to the discussion of the subject matter of this bill, but I
do not think that one in my official capacity
should let the occasion go by without making
some reference to the very caustic remarks
of the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) about Sir Henry Thornton,
Mr. Vaughan, Mr. Donald Gordon and General
McNaughton. I must confess some little surprise at the nature of those remarks, because
I should have thought that after the results
of the recent Saskatchewan election my
honourable friend would. have been in a little
happier frame of mind.
Other senators have dealt with the policy
and the record of the late Sir Henry Thornton,
and it is not necessary for me to add to what
they have said. Mr. Vaughan made in the
press a most effective retort to the attack
upon him. Mr. Donald Gordon and General
McNaughton have recently been before a
committee of the Senate, and I am convinced
that our colleague from Blaine Lake would
have much difficulty in convincing anyone
who heard those gentlemen there that wise
and capable services had not been available
to the government of Canada since the passing
of the commission which administered the
Canadian National Railway from 1930 to 1935.
Our colleague from Blaine Lake was himself
a distinguished member of that commission,
and, from what I know of him, I am sure

that he rendered a very great service to the
railway at that time.

Hon. Mr. Burchill moved the second reading of Bill 183, an Act to amend the Veterans

a section which provides that where insurance money becomes part of the estate of an
insured, the estate shall be entitled to receive
only the reserve under the contract at the
time of the death of the insured. It was
intended that that section should be deleted
from the Act, but when the bill of last session was reported from committee the
amendment was inadvertently left out. The
bill now before us, the application of which is
retroactive to June 1, 1951, would remove
the section of the Act to which I have
referred.

read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Next sitting.
PENSION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Burchili moved the second reading
of Bill 184, an Act to amend the Pension Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
seeks to do three things. First, it would
increase the annual allowance to leg and arm
amputation cases, and certain other disability
pensioners, for wear and tear of clothing,
from $54 to $72 for one category of amputee,
and from $22 to $30 for another category. The
estimated liability under this legislation is
$110,000.
Secondly, the present Act provides for an
award to one dependent parent of a deceased
member of the forces in the maximum monthly
amount of $75, and in the case of two parents,
of an additional award of $15 per month.
This bill would increase the latter payment
to a maximum of $25, thus making the total
maximum award to two dependent parents of
$100 a month. The estimated annual increase
in liability is $50,000.

Thirdly, the bill seeks to make sure that
an applicant whose claim is based on accidental injury or death due to any negligence
on the part of a servant of the Crown, shall
not be placed in any better position than an
applicant whose claim is based on disability
or death due to enemy action. This amendment corresponds with one which was introduced in connection with the Government
Employees Compensation Act, 1947. I believe
there was a case in which a person was
accidentally injured, or met death, by reason
of the negligence of a civil servant, and
the Court awarded damages much in excess of
the amount that would otherwise have been
allowed.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Next sitting.

Pensions and Allowances Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill has
to do with the schedules of pensions payable
under Parts VI and VIII of this Act, and
would provide that air raid precaution
workers and voluntary aid detachments be
treated for pension purposes on the same
basis as are other civilian war pensioners.
Five awards have been made under schedule
I of the present Act, and one under schedule
II; and it is unlikely that any further awards
will be made in these two classes. The rates
for these pensions were not increased when
other pension rates were increased in October,
1947 and again in January, 1952. The bill
proposes to increase by 50 per cent the
amounts presently payable to the six pensioners who are in receipt of the awards just
mentioned. This is approximately in keeping
with other pension increases. The estimated
liability covering this amendment will be
$1,068.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to ask the
honourable senator if there are only six
persons receiving pensions under this arrangement?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Under these particular
schedules, yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce,
where the question asked by the honourable
gentleman with the eagle eye, our colleague
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), can
be answered.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Just off hand I would
say that the term of the commissioner may
be extended for a twelve-month period after
the commissioner reaches the age of seventy,
but not after he reaches the age of seventyfive. I am not certain as to the accuracy
of this information, and I think the bill
should be referred ta the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
IMMIGRATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. G. Turgeon moved the second reading of Bill 305, an Act respecting Immigration.

15708-34

He said: Honourable senators, I am one
of those who deeply feel the necessity for
more and more immigration ta Canada, but
as the bill now before us does not deal with
any basic policy of immigration I do not
intend to say anything in this connection.
The purpose of this legislation is simply
to amend, consolidate and clarify the Immigration Act which, with certain amendments, bas been in force in Canada since
1910. Thanks to the farsightedness of the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and due to the courtesy of the Minister
of Citizenship and Immigration, the Deputy
Minister and other officials of the department, the members of the Senate Standing
Committee on Immigration and Labour were
able to discuss in detail the subject matter
of this measure before the bill itself actually reached this chamber.
Since our committee met to discuss the
various proposed changes to the Immigration
Act, the bill itself was passed by the House
of Commons with a few additional amendments. These new amendments deal mainly
with the responsibility and liability of transportation companies in connection with the
deportation of immigrants should they be
found unacceptable, for some reason. or
another, after spending a certain period in
this country and before receiving Canadian
citizenship.
The proposed changes in the bill relate to
the admission of immigrants and to certain
factors which may prevent them from coming into this country. A reading of this
legislation will show that it is the intention
of the Minister and his colleagues to make
life easier for immigrants after they
arrive in Canada, and for those who may
have to leave this country.
I should like to call to the attention of the
Senate the extension of good, will towards
people from other lands who wish to come
and live among us. For instance, if a person
who has committed some offence has been
able to rehabilitate himself over a certain
period he will not be prohibited from landing as an immigrant in Canada. There are
provisions in the bill dealing with the now
defunct International Refugee Organization.
At the present time the Government of
Canada may grant loans to immigrants In
respect of the costs of their transportation to
Canada and to certain points within this
country. These loans are made by way of
estimates approved by parliament. The bill
before us provides that the Government of
Canada, through the Minister of Finance,
may from time to tirne grant loans out of the

SENATE
Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada to
assist immigrants in their passage to Canada,
and to any point inside Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would these transportation
loans enable immigrants to travel as far
west as British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: At the present time
immigrants are only assisted in their passage
to Canada and to points east of Winnipeg;
they do not receive any government assistance beyond Winnipeg. In these cases usually
the employer or employing companies assist
the immigrants. Under the amendments contained in the bill, those travelling to points
west of Winnipeg will now receive the same
consideration as those who settle east of
Winnipeg.
Honourable senators, as this bill is purely
for the purpose of consolidating andi clarifying the Immigration Act, and because the
session is drawing to a close, I shall say
nothing further in support of its second
reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read a third, time?
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: I would ask that it be sent
to committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Immigration.
The motion was agreed to.
ARMY BENEVOLENT FUND BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Roberison moved the
second reading of Bill 334, an Act to amend
the Army Benevolent Fund Act, 1947.
He said: Honourable senators may recall
that the Army Benevolent Fund Act, 1947,
was enacted following a report made in that
year by a special committee from the House
of Commons on canteen funds. It was
designed to establish a central benevolent
fund from army canteen and related service
funds, from which grants could be made to
veterans to help them meet conditions of
emergency. These veterans were defined as
being persons who were on active service
in the military forces of Canada during
World War II.
The Army Benevolent Fund is administered
by a board set up under the Act, consisting
of five members, who serve voluntarily under
the chairmanship of Lieut-General Murchie.
The board has a secretary who is paid a
salary out of the funds.

When this fund was set up under the Act
it was assumed that there would be prospective beneficiairies for about fifty years, and
the actuarial scheme contemplates that the
bulk of the expenditures from the fund will
be made during the first thirty years, at the
rate of $400,000 per annum. It turns out,
however, that the board's current annual
expenditures are higher than were estimated.
The Act provides that the fund shall be
credited with interest at the rate of 2 per
cent per annum, semi-annually, on the minimum monthly balances. The capital amount
of the fund is at present about $9,000,000,
so the income amounts to approximately
$225,000. This $9,000,000 is deposited with
the Receiver General and is administered as
a trust fund by the Army Benevolent Fund
Board. The fund is audited by the Auditor
General. In all provinces the board bas
committees which approve or reject applications, submitted through welfare agencies.
It would seem that if expenditures were to
continue at the average of more than $400,000
per annum, the fund would be depleted to a
greater extent than was contemplated. In
order to avoid this, the present bill proposes
to increase the interest rate from 22 to 32
per cent per annum on minimum monthly
balances to the credit of the fund not in
The present rate of
excess of $5,000,000.
2½ per cent per annum will, of course, be
retained on the monthly balances in excess
of $5,000,000. That is to say, the rate of
32 per cent per annum will be paid on
monthly balances up to $5,000,000, and 21 per
cent on balances in excess of that sum. This
amendment is to be effective on the lst of
April, 1952. I may say that the proposal to
raise the interest rate to 31 per cent seems
reasonable having regard to the interest rates
being paid under statute to other comparable
funds at the present time.
The other important amendment proposed
to this Act arises out of the experience of the
board over the last few years. It has been
found that persons interested in the welfare
of army veterans often wish to make donations or bequests to the Army Benevolent
Fund, but at present the board has no
authority to accept such donations or bequests.
Likewise, it has been found that some
veterans themselves have desired to repay to
the fund grants that have been made to them.
Again, the board is unable to accept such
Similarly, if the board should
refunds.
recover moneys that have been paid out by
reason of fraud or misrepresentation on the
part of the recipient, they could not go to the
credit of the fund. Such moneys, like those I
have already mentioned, would go to consolidated revenue, and the fund would not
itself receive any benefit.

JUNE 25, 1952
It is proposed, therefore, to make it possible
for the board to accept donations from
benevolently-minded persons, and voluntary
refunds from veterans who have received
grants to help them out of emergencies and
who are now in a position to put the money
back into the fund to help other veterans in
turn; and to put back into the fund moneys
recovered from persons who obtained grants
by fraud. It will be observed that these
measures will also serve to bolster and maintain the fund at a level which will likely
assure its continuance over the period it was
designed to serve.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask the leader a
question? By whom is this interest paid?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The principal amount
of $9,000,000 is deposited with the Receiver
General in the Consolidate Revenue Fund
and is administered as a trust fund. The
position, I take it, is this. Because of this
trust fund the Receiver General bas available
for ordinary government purposes $9,000,000
more than would otherwise be available,
and in the past a rate of 2j par cent interest
bas been payable, under the statute, on the
minimum monthly balances.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Who has been paying the
interest?
Hon. Mr. Robertson:

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Is the interest charged to

Hon. Mr. Robertson: No. The interest is
charged in the same way as the interest on
the public debt of all kinds. If that $9,000,000
were removed from the Consolidated Revenue
Fund
and
the
government
borrowed
$9,000,000 from another source, a corresponding rate of interest would have to be paid
on that money to the other source.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can the leader tell us
whether it is only the interest on the loan
that is used each year or whether a certain
amount of the capital also is being used?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: What is being used
every year is not only the interest, but a
portion of the capital as well.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
55708-34J

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Next sitting, unless
there is some suggestion to the contrary.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 346, an Act to
authorize the provision of moneys to meet
certain capital expenditures of the Canadian
National Railways System during the calendar year 1952, and to authorize the guarantee
by Her Majesty of certain securities to be
issued by the Canadian National Railway
Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
divides itself into four specific parts.
The first part of the bill, which is similar
to bills of previous years, is to authorize the
Canadian National Railways to incur capital
expenditures up to $154,755,280.
The second part is to authorize the railway
company to acquire additional working capital in an amount not exceeding $15 million.
Provision was made last year for additional
working capital of $20 million.
The third part of the measure would
authorize the railway company to make capital expenditures prior to July 1, 1953, to discharge obligations incurred under the Act
and which become due and payable after
January 1, 1953. While this section is new, it
does not involve any new principle. The law
officers of the Crown have ruled that the
authority contained in the annual Financing
and Guarantee Acts does not expire at the
end of the calendar year. It was felt that it
was more desirable to disclose this information to parliament by specifically referring
to it.
The last part of the bill would permit the
railway company to enter into contracts for
new equipment in the amount of $123,130,710.
This provision was first introduced last year
when the company was authorized to place
orders for $111,512,920. It should be noted
that none of this equipment is expected to be
delivered in 1952.
By way of summary, parliament is being
asked to approve the financing, either by way
of direct loan from the government or the
issue of securities of the company guaranteed

by the government, in the amount of $202,405,280. This amount is made up as follows:

It will be noted from this table that this
legislation covers amounts that wer e authorized by previous Financing and Guarantee
Acts. In other words, this Act wil 1 be the
sole authority for the financing of th e railway
company up to July 1, 1953.
The usual authority is provided for the
making of temporary loans to the railway
company and Trans-Canada Airlines ,to meet
operating deficits up to June 30, 19 53. While
the Capital Revision Act of this y,ear contemplates that the railway will not have any
deficits in the future, it sometimes happens
that deficits occur in the early mont hs of the
calendar year.
Loans by the government to the railway
company made under previous Finan cing and
Guarantee Acts, and outstanding at May 31,

Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I was not sure whether, having s poken on
the other bill having to do with t he Canadian National Railway, I would be per-

freight
rates than by building roads. As long ago
as 1913 I was riding freight trains as many
as twenty-seven days eut et the month,
travelling back and forth across the country with sbipments of horses. I rode tbe old
Canadian Nortbern west from Fort William.
0f course everything is moving faster today;
cultivation of millions of acres of land in
Western Canada bas created a huge freigbt
revenue.
I ar sure that the railway would not
have bad the foolish expenditures under the
management of the famous Setcbman Hanna
that it did under the management cf Sfr
Henry Thernton, wbo, as I have said before,
threw down a railway in wartime, wben
money was ne object. In tact, the experience gained then helped te ruin bim for the
efficient management of the normal peratiens of a railway in Canada. Tbernton went
te England, ani there be was knighted fer
bis services te Canada in rushîng through
this railread. But England tried bim for a
time in the management cf one et its roads,
at a salary ef $25,000 a year, but seon got
rid of bim.
I bave had many sad experiences witb
shipments of livestock over the railread. I
recail one occasion during Sir Henry's management when, on a bot day in July, I bad
a carlead of horses te be sbipped nertb
trom Meese Jaw. I came dewn frem Regina
in the nigbt, and at 5 e'clock in the merning
I triet ail ever the place to lecate a yardman
t tel me if I ceult unleat the herses te
water themn, because tbey were sweltering
in the car. When I finally ound a man, be
swere at me and telt me if I toek tbe herses
out-and tbere were 22 of them-I would
bave to get tbem back in a migbty quick
hurry because the train was pulling eut in
short order. By 7 e'clock I bati the herses
ail back in the car, and there they stayed
until 10 o'clock that night. When I made
inqufries from tbe railway, tbey said they
weuld be meving any time. Well, I finally
got te Saskatoon, and there they told me
that treîgbt going on te Blaine Lake had
lett an heur age, which meant tbat I had te
wait trom Friday until Menday. I tolt the
freigbt effice they coul keep the herses.

JUNE 25, 1952
They wanted to know why I had not wired
ahead. I said "I am not running the railway; I am only trying to ship some stock
and pay the freight on it. Surely you know
what is coming in and what its destination
is". Surely there must have been some
trains coming in which could have taken
thern to their destination. The upshot was
that every one of the horses was scalded
down the side.
That sort of thing was typical of the whole
set-up. I take no pleasure in making these
criticisms, and I suppose the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) thinks I
should show good humour and feel kindly
towards these people. I try to, but often I
get tired of the everlasting chorus of praise
that some of these executives are given and
the idea that they are a sort of supermen.
We all know that in the days of their power
such dictators as Mussolini and Hitler made
it unsafe for anyone to utter a word of criticism. Under the old railway regime it might
mean thousands of dollars to you if you sang
songs of praise in the right quarter.
As regards the construction of the roads,
I happen to know something about the way
they were built. If you look at the records
you will find that in great stretches of the
grade there was hardly one bit of decent
earth. In my simplicity, when I contracted
for a piece of the road, I had the project of
se.nding engineers forward to test the ground
for rock and hard-pan. But no: one was told
to go ahead with the grade, with so much for
loose earth, so much for hard-pan, so much
for loose rock, so much for rock; and it was
not unknown that engineers who appraised the
work found a new car sitting in front of their
door. In my time it was the custom that a
man would make some deal and present his
bill, and the tender had nothing to do with
it; additional money was paid. When a former Liberal government was building the
road in Alberta and Saskatchewan there was
no railroad construction proceeding in any
other part of Canada; yet three of the directors were from Ontario, three from Quebec,
one from British Columbia and one from each
of the Maritime Provinces, but not one from
either Saskatchewan or Alberta. When I was
asked if I would like an appointment I said
that at that stage it would be a case of locking the door after the horse was stolen, but
if there was anything I could do, I would
do it.
Here is another personal recollection. The
people of the little village of Blaine Lake put
on a banquet and invited Sir Henry Thornton.
Our village was not on the main line, and
was rather difficult of access, but there was
nothing to prevent anybody driving there in
a car. I expected that Sir Henry would travel

by automobile to our village, which then had
no more than four hundred people in it, but
to my astonishment there arrived a long
special train of private cars, with the president
and a company of fifteen to thirty-thousanddollar-a-year men. You can imagine what I
thought of that. And Sir Henry's car was
not the only private car which came to
Blaine Lake.
I am not criticizing Liberal governments
only, I am criticizing the Conservatives too;
they fell down miserably. The danger of
such a set-up is obvious. A huge undertaking
like the Canadian National Railroad, with its
hotels and the whole elaborate organization,
can become a danger to democratic government. I would prefer to see it disposed of.
It becomes a greater power than the national
government itself; it may be regarded in itself
as a third government. That is typical of
what happens under government ownership.
Had I been in control in 1930 I would have
dismissed the head of every department of the
Canadian National System, though at the
same time I would have attempted to find
them employment elsewhere. But the management had spent so much money advertising
themselves that it became dangerous for any
employee to criticize them. We are told in the
good Book to "mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright", but we are not instructed
to worship him. It may be necessary to have
a chain of responsibility and authority, with
the top men in supreme control, but while
this practice is defended as making for confidence and co-operation, it is too often
ineffective; and when one comes in contact
with these supposed supermen the experience
is frequently very disappointing; one discovers
that, after all, they have feet of clay.
I repeat that I take no pleasure in these
criticisms; but I believe it is my duty as a
man to stand here in my place and comment
on Canadian affairs as I know them. I know
that many have found it easier to take another
course: some who were earning $5,000 a year
when Sir Henry took charge were almost
immediately raised to positions carrying
salaries of three times that amount, but that
does not prove that they were worth what
they got.
Honourable senators have done Sir Henry
the honour of saying that he resigned. That
is not correct.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Polite language.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. Here is another
example of the way things went on. The
Canadian National headquarters occupies a
large building on McGill Street, in Montreal.
The offices also are very spacious, some of
them are more like double rooms, with an

SENATE
entrance door, and quite a distance from one
end to the other. On one occasion when I

improperly, attempted to intimidate me as
regards my actions on the board. He told me
about how he got cars across the line, and said
he knew enough political stufT on some Conservatives and Liberals to make things terrible
for them if he "lifted the lid". I said "You can
lift the lid as high as you like, whether the
wrong-doer is a Conservative or a Liberal;
as far as I am concerned, I am going to try
to do the right job here". Later he went to
Blaine Lake in his private car, and as a
result of what developed I insisted on his
retirement, and he left the service with a
pension of $2,700 a year,-which in those
days was pretty good. At one time a man
was produced who took an oath that he overheard the conversation between this party and
myself. The offices, as I have said, were
very large; the supposed witness was in
another office; and unless there had been a
microphone on the table where we sat it
would have been impossible for him to have
heard us.
The man who appeared to be the chief
legal advisor of the system, although most of
the actual work was being farmed out all
over Canada, drew $30,000 a year, and when
we reduced his salary to $18,000 he immediately resigned. Today, I understand, he is
practising law and 'drawing a pension of
$8,000 a year. At the time of his resignation
he stated that he was ready to talk about

associates,-presumably because be wanted to

we do not again have to go through the
ordeal of hearing people sing glorious refrains
about this and that great superman, because
there is no such person.
I want to repeat that the Canadian National
Railway System was just as efficiently
operated before Sir Henry Thornton took
over as after. I make this statement as
one who has travelled on the line and paid
freight rates, and so on, and I maintain that
there was not the fine spirit of co-operation
among the railway employees that the
honourable gentleman from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Stambaugh) would have us believe. The
first year that I was on the board I never
heard one word of criticism from the
Westerners, because they had the idea that I
would tell Sir Henry everything they said
when he came West in his private car and

special train. However, when they found out
that this was not the case, they started
to do some talking, and I learned of the
difficult situation in British Columbia. There
was certainly no spirit of co-operation, on
the contrary, the men were as bitter as
they could be. A certain colonel, who married a relative of Sir Henry's from New
York, was made a representative of the railway company at $40,000 a year, and the
people of Canada, including my friend from
Bruce, spent $4,000 just to fix up the grounds
of this representative's residence. In those
days the best men in the system might find
themselves fired if they said one word against
Sir Henry, while others might find themselves
promoted if they praised him. I mentioned
a certain official the other day who received
a salary of $30,000 a year. This man came
from New Brunswick, and when be refused
to sign a lien at the direction of Sir Henry
Thornton, be was immediately retired and
although he was not entitled to any pension
be was granted $10,000 a year as a retiring
allowance. I know of one superintendent of
the railway-and my honourable friend from
Bruce knows him too-who quit going to a
certain church after he had heard the minister
of that church praise Sir Henry Thornton.
I regret very much that I find it necessary
to make these comments at this time, but
I feel that as a member of this chamber it
is my duty to do so.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Honourable senators,
I do not know the superintendent about
whom our esteemed colleague has just spoken.
I know practically all the superintendents in
the West, and I do not know of one who
has anything to say against Sir Henry Thornton. I want to repeat what I said earlier
this afternoon, that the employees of the
C.N.R. from sectionmen to superintendentsengineers, firemen, and brakemen-have
nothing but the highest regard for the
memory of Sir Henry. They speak well
of him now and they spoke well of him when
he was alive. I make the fiat statement that
in the opinion of railwaymen and businessmen throughout Canada, Sir Henry was the
best railroad administrator that we have ever
had in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They do not believe any
such thing.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.

time the indications are that at least the same
eight provinces which had agreements in the
past five years will be entering into new
agreements for a further five year period.
Under the proposed new agreements the
taxes which the provinces will refrain from
imposing will be the same as those involved
under the old agreement. These taxes will
include the personal income tax, the corporation income tax, the so-called "corporation
taxes"-taxes on places of business, paid-up
capital, and so on-and succession duties.
Just as under the old agreement, any province will have the option of retaining its succession duties if it so chooses-with, of
course, an offsetting reduction in its compensation. As was explained in the Budget

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move that the bill

The motion was agreed to.

SENATE
For the new tax agreements the federal
government proposed at the conference in 1950
that the new guaranteed minimum payments
should be the minimum amounts fixed in the
old agreements, adjusted upwards by the ratio
of change in provincial population and gross
national product per capita between 1942
and 1948. In general, this had the effect of
increasing the minimum payments by 50 per
cent. However, at the same time, to meet the
position of certain provinces which had argued
that greater emphasis should be given to the
element of tax potential, a new formula was
introduced. The components of this new
formula were as follows: (1) the yield of a
personal income tax at 5 per cent of 1948
federal rates applied to 1948 incomes in the
province; (2) The yield of a tax of 8ï per
cent on corporation profits earned in the
province in 1948;-The rate of 81 per cent,
I might explain, is taken as a fair measure
of the corporation tax potential and takes
account of the separate or specific taxes traditionally levied by provinces as well as taxes
on corporate profits.-(3) The average
revenue received by the province in a recent
three-year period from succession duties;(4) Statutory subsidies payable to the province in 1948.
In actual application, this
formula was of benefit only to the province
of Ontario.
Minor modifications in the calculation of the
adjustment between 1942 and 1948 have been
accepted as a result of provincial representations subsequent to the conference, but essentially the new guaranteed minima are those
offered by the federal government in December, 1950.
With the consent of the house, I will place
on Hansard a table showing the guaranteed
minimum payments under the old agreements and the payments that will form the
basis of new agreements that will be authorized by this legislation.
The table is as follows:
Guaranteed Minimum Annual Payments under 1947
Agreement and under Most Favourable Option
under 1952 Agreement.

It should be clearly understood that these
amounts are only the fixed minimum payments below which no annual payment may
fall. The actual amounts payable in a given
year are the result of calculations by which
these minimum amounts are increased to
give effect to national growth, as measured by
the gross national product per capita, and
to provincial growth, as measured by provincial population.
Under the old agreements the adjustment
for these factors was calculated on the average of ratios for three years preceding the
year of payment in relation to the base year
1942. This three-year averaging had the effect
of stabilizing the adjusted payment by reducing the effect of a sudden change in economic
conditions. Some of the provinces felt, however, that in a period of very rapid growth
the three-year averaging process slowed
down unduly the increase in provincial
revenues at a time when rising revenues were
needed. It has, therefore, been proposed that
a province should have the choice between
an adjustment based on a two-year average
and one based solely on the data relating to
the one year immediately preceding the year
of payment. The provinces which have so far
indicated their desire to enter an agreement
have all elected to take the one-year option.
Under the new agreements, therefore, the
adjusted payments will be based on the ratio
of gross national product per capita and of
provincial population in the year preceding
the year of payment over the new base year
1948. I would also suggest that another table
be placed on Hansard comparing the guaranteed minimum payments that will be authorized for each province under this bill with
the amount of the adjusted payments, as at
present estimated, that will be paid in the
first fiscal year of the new agreement. These
amounts are before any deduction for statutory subsidies.

REPORT

OF FINANCE COMMITTEE-MOTION
TO PRINT

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
on Tuesday, June 24, the Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Finance (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) suggested that the report of the
Committee on Finance, together with the
attached exhibits, be printed in the Minutes
of the Proceedings for that day. I find that
the report was printed but that the attached
exhibits were not. When preparing a speech
for today I was unable to get the information
contained in the exhibits. Upon making inquiries I learned that it will be some little
time before these exhibits can be printed;
therefore I would move at this time that the
report of the committee, together with the
exhibits, be printed as an appendix to
Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Just to clarify the
point, may I ask my honourable friend if
his motion includes the committee's report
as well as the exhibits attached thereto?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The committee's report
has been published in the Minutes, but it
has not appeared in Hansard. What I want
is to have the report and the exhibits published in Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Have the exhibits
been furnished to the Printing Bureau?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The committee's report
was presented on Tuesday, the 24th, and
from the discussion that took place on that
day I understood that the report, together
with the exhibits, would be printed in the
Minutes of the next day. Through some
misunderstanding, the report only was printed

leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
now moves that the report and the exhibits
be printed in Hansard for today. Of course,
if that meets with the wishes of the house,
the whole story will appear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, as I understand it, the intention on
Tuesday was that the committee's report, as
55708-351

well as the exhibits, should appear in the
Minutes. The report only was printed, and
it now seems to me that nothing further is
needed than an order that the exhibits also
be printed.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators,
may I say just a word? The intention of the
committee, in the advice it gave to the Chairman, was exactly as stated by the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). That is,
the report, together with the exhibits, was to
be published in Hansard. I think that by
passing the motion to do this we would
settle the whole matter.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with leave of the house, it is moved
by the Honourable Senator Haig, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Lambert, that
the report of the Committee on Finance, together with the exhibits attached thereto,

Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, on
the motion for third reading I should like to
refer back to a question asked yesterday by
the honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), as to the retirement of members of the Board of Grain Commissioners.
Had my mental faculties been working as
they should have been and were notHon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -I would have recalled
that the Act has for a long time contained
a section dealing with that matter. It provides that a commissioner may retire at the
age of 70; however, power is given to the

Governor in Council to extend the term of
appointment by successive periods of twleve
months until the commissioner attains the
age of 75 years. I believe that is the explanation my honourable friend asked for.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In asking the question I was
not taking exception to the provision that
permits a commissioner's term of office to be
extended, provided he is able to do the job.
I could not see the sense of providing in the
first place, that a commissioner could not carry
on beyond 70 years of age, and, in the second
place that his term of office could be extended
by twelve months periods up to the age of
75. The mere fact that such provisions are
in the Act is scarcely a reason why, in my
opinion, they should be so stupidly worded.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the orders of the day are proceeded
with may I state, for the benefit of those
honourable members who were not at the
meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committee this morning, that I was asked to

suggest at this stage the adjournment of the
bouse during pleasure, to reassemble at the
call of the bell when the committee shall have
concluded its deliberations. The immediate
business before the committee is to consider
various phases of the Combines Investigation
Bill and to hear some witnesses with reference to the Canadian National Railways legislation. I do not know, of course, how long the
committee will be in session. To ascertain the
opinion of honourable senators I move that
the Senate do now adjourn during pleasure,
to reassemble at the call of the bell, on the
conclusion of the business of the Banking
and Commerce Committee. We can then proceed with the business on the order paper
as rapidly as circumstances permit.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, this
seens to be unusual procedure. We are here
to deal with the orders of the day, which
include a number of bills. Are we to sit this
evening to deal with these matters? The bill
under discussion in the Banking and Commerce Committee is no more important than
the veterans legislation which is before us.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I can only say that I
have explained the situation to the house.
As to the honourable senator's question
whether we are to sit this evening or not, I
suggest that when we reassemble we sit as
long as the house wishes. If the business on
the order paper is not concluded by 6 o'clock
we can do one of two things; either adjourn
until tomorrow morning-in which event the
Banking and Commerce Committee would be
able to consider this evening two specific
bills which have not yet come before the
house-or continue our session this evening.
I will consent to any course which com*mends
itseif to the house generally.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the motion is that the house adjourn
during pleasure, to reassemble at the call of
the bell. Is it your pleasure to agree to the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Reid: On division.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Senate
adjourned during pleasure.

provided the house with such detailed information when lie explained this bill yesterday.
I had intended asking that the bill be referred
to committee so that I could get certain
information, and I think the leader of the
government was anticipating such action when
he provided the house with the statistics
and other data.
In conclusion I want to reiterate that I am
opposed to this type of legislation. I have
always thought that there should be a conference between the municipalities, the
provinces and the dominion as to the various
fields of taxation. The demand for financial
help from the federal government is growing
all the time. Why, you cannot pick up a
paper in any metropolitan centre-Montreal,
Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver, or any other
city-but you will find a resolution authorizing some organization to apply to the
Dominion Government for money for some
purpose with which the federal authority
has nothing whatever to do. Take education.
I read somewhere that it is estimated that
this year we will pay out $71 million on
education. It never was intended that the
federal authority should grant money to
pay the costs of education. I am not opposed
to the grant, for I happen to know that the
university and the colleges of my own city
could not carry on without this help, and
I presume the same is true of similar institutions in all our cities.
I believe I shall live long enough to see
the problem of payments by the dominion to
the provinces become acute. The provinces
will not want to cut their expenditures,
and they will say to the dominion "You get
the money and give it to us." And if the
national income should decline to the point
that federal taxes cannot bring in the desired
revenue, the Dominion Government will not
be able to meet the provincial demands.
There is no pessimism in that statement.
I am aware of the resources of our country,
I know a good deal about Canada and ber
prospects for future prosperity.
I also
realize what tremendous sums we are now
spending and shall have to continue to
spend for many years to come, if the present
cold war lasts much longer. A very prominent man, whose name I need not give, was
visiting in the States recently, and lie told
me it was quite evident that the American
people realized that their expenditures on
defence could not be continued indefinitely
at the present rate, and that there might come
a day when the United States would have to
call on Russia for a showdown. We all
know what Russia has been doing, in Europe
and elsewhere; lier policy of fomenting
trouble, here, there and all over, is responsible for a large part of the expenditures
of the western nations on defence.

Now, coming back to this bill, let me
state clearly that I am opposed to it. I
have not the right to vote against it, because
the federal government and certain provinces
have made agreements, and I do not think
it is my duty to try to have those agreements
set aside. But as a senator and a member
of parliament for Canada I have the right
and duty to say that I think this system of
finance is wrong. I am saying that not
because Ontario has not signed an agreement,
and not because Quebec has not signed an
agreement, but because in my heart I believe
that the system is wrong.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I wish to say a few words before the bill
passes. I might not rise to offer any criticism on this occasion were it not for the
fact that the persons who signed the agreement on behalf of British Columbia are now
about to be relegated to private life. I
well remember that when the dominion and
the provinces were holding a conference in
1945 two things were held out to the provinces as-I will not say, a bait, but an
attraction. They were told, first, that a
tax rental agreement would obviate double
taxation; and, secondly, that it would provide
each province with a guaranteed minimum
revenue. Well, around that time some people
in this country were predicting a depression,
and one or two provinces-we may as well
be candid-were a little afraid that if they
did not accept the terms of the agreement and
their economy failed, they might be hard put
to carry on.
My chief purpose in rising on this occasion
is to draw the attention of the Senate, and
of the government as well, to something that
has occurred since the agreements were first
put into effect, namely, an increasing demand
by the people of all provinces for more help
for education. Now, in British Columbia,
as in other provinces, the cost of education
bears largely upon the land.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It does in most provinces.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And the provincial cabinet
ministers and other governmental authorities
are not backward in telling the people, "Well,
we are getting just so much from the dominion
government and we cannot do any more for
you." There is going to be an ever-ncreasing
drive upon the federal authorities for more
financial support of education. The other day
I saw a statement that a new department of
the Dominion Government is being mooted,
to be known as the Department of Education
and Culture. In my opinion the demand
upon the federal authorities for more funds
for education will be a permanent one.

JUNE 26, 1952
I agree with the last two speakers that this
systen is not right, and that it is not good
policy for a government to spend money
where it does not tax. The provincial governments like the system-at least, the provincial
governments that have signed the agreements
do. I am not going to rehash any of the recent
provincial election campaigns, but people
from Saskatchewan tell me that during the
campaign in that province not one word was
said by members of the C.C.F. government
about the amount of money that was being
received from the dominion under the tax
rental agreement; if people complained about
the high taxes, they were told that the blame
rested on Ottawa. A few years ago, when
I was Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister
of National Health, the federal grants for the
various hospitals came before me after
passing through the minister and the department, and I was amazed to find the Premier
of British Columbia telling the minister that
the announcement of any grants from the
federal government should be made first from
Victoria rather than from Ottawa. Evidently
the premier wanted to take all the political
credit for those grants, which were raised
by taxes levied and collected by the federal
government.
It is my opinion that the people are going
to demand more services from government,
and that, notwithstanding the British North
America Act, increasing sums will be granted
by the federal government for education here,
for welfare there, for some other purpose
elsewhere, and that bit by bit the responsibility for certain things that now rests with
the -provinces will become centralized at
Ottawa. That development may be inevitable,
but if it is I think the fact should be made
plain to our people.
In the light of the recent election fiasco in
British Columbia I am wondering how the
agreement between that province and the
dominion will be received by whoever takes
office after the 3rd of July. Those who signed
the agreement on behalf of the province will
not be in public life much longer, and in
these circumstances one feels freer to criticize than one otherwise would. In my opinion,
the province which said least about what the
Dominion Government is paying, is being
better treated than British Columbia. You
only have to consider our population and great
industrial development in British Columbia
to realize that we are not getting the benefit
that we should get under the agreement. I
admit that so long as the provincial economy
is growing and business continues to expand,
the province will benefit from this to some
degree under the agreement; and that if we
do run into a depression the province will
receive at least the minimum amount guaranteed. I am opposed to the principle of this

bill because it means that what was started
as a temporary measure is now, bit by bit,
becoming a permanent practice. The government of Canada is gradually taking over
powers which under the British North
America Act rightfully belong to the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There is little to be gained
by protesting at this stage, for the agreements
have been signed by duly accredited representatives of the provinces, and it may well
be asked what right we have to criticize.
But I want to go on record today as opposing
the principle of the bill, and to warn the
government and the people of Canada that
if it is the wish of the majority that authority
be centralized in Ottawa, that should be
plainly stated.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
have only a few remarks to make. My criticism, unlike that expressed by my honourable
friend from New Westminister (Hon. Mr.
Reid), would be that the federal government put over rather a sharp deal on
the province of Saskatchewan. When the
income tax figures on the 1951-52 crop are
disclosed, it will become more evident that
Saskatchewan should be getting a few million dollars more than were agreed upon.
A number of legal lights in that province who
seem to be amassing fortunes, will be called
upon to make substantial contributions by
way of income tax. Perhaps it was because
of the youth and inexperience of the Premier
of Saskatchewan that the federal government
was able to drive such a hard bargain.
As far as British Columbia is concerned,
I think subsequent events will show that
Ottawa was quite generous with that province.
My only object in rising at this time is to
protest against the small amount awarded
under the agreement with the province of
Saskatchewan.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
is quite clear to me that this legislation should
pass, but that does not prevent my offering
some observations about the principle on
which it is based. I am among those who
believe that in a country as vast as Canada
it is absolutely necessary to maintain the
strength and independence of the provincial
governments in their own fields.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That question was fully
discussed when our constitution was framed,
over eighty years ago, and it is a matter of
history that the Canadian confederation of
1867 would never have taken place had there
not been a recognition of the need for the
development of the provinces. That cannot
be gainsaid.

SENATE
When the tax rental agreements were
entered into, as has already been said, they
were regarded as temporary in character.
They came into effect during wartime, with
the full approval of all or most of the provinces, to assist in meeting defence expenditures. It was later thought desirable that
there should be a continuation of the
arrangement, but I submit to my colleagues
here today that the principle, whereby one
government raises money and passes it over
to another authority to spend it, is unsound
and will lead to all sorts of bargaining and
criticism.
We have a good example before us today
of the type of dissatisfaction that can be
expected.
The honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) complained
that the agreement between the federal
authorities and the province of Saskatchewan
indicated sharp practice on the part of the
federal authorities in negotiating a settlement with that province. I am satisfied
that if an intelligent man like our colleague
from Blaine Lake holds that view, many
other Canadians share it with him. I put
to the house this simple question: Is such
an arrangement conducive to the harmony
that must be maintained in this far-fiung
country if it is to make its way in the
world? My answer is that it is not. It leaves
ample opportunity for friction between
governments, and for the placing of blame
by one upon the other. I can foresee circumstances in which a provincial government,
when asked to make certain expenditures,
would come up with the ready excuse, "If
Ottawa had been a little more generous with
us we would be prepared to meet this
demand; but Ottawa has given us Qnly so
much." That is not a desirable state of
affairs.
I say that the only final solution to this
question is a clear understanding between
the federal authorities and the provinces
as to where their relative powers and responsibilities begin and end. Each is independent
of the other, as is clearly stated in our
constitution, and the provinces should be
in a position to raise the revenue necessary
to meet their responsibilities. There is in
Canada today a great deal of overlapping of
the services and mixing up of the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial governments. Two examples of such duplication
occur in matters affecting health and agriculture, both of which are handled in part by
the two authorities, with no clear demarcation of where their respective responsibilities
start and end. Such confusion can have no
other effect than to add to the cost of administration. I hope that public opinion will
demand a clear definition of the responsibilities of the dominion and the provinces, and

that the provinces be placed in a position
to raise sufficient revenue to discharge their
obligations.
That simple proposition represents the
approach made to the question by the body
known as the Sirois Commission. That commission, as its findings show, did not march
with the practice that bas developed of
making agreements such as these, by which
the dominion hands over per capita grants
to the provinces, irrespective of their financial
needs. That was not the principle of the
report; and I still maintain that an effort
should be made to implement the spirit
of the recommendations in that report. As
honourable senators may recall, there was
an attempt in that direction. After the report
was received a provincial conference was
held in Ottawa, but it failed to achieve anything because of objections by some provinces, that they might suffer if effect were
given to the commission's recommendations.
As the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has said, British
Columbia is assured of an immense development in the next twenty-five years; it will
have important financial institutions and
great industrial plants. How long will it
be willing to remain under an arrangement
of this kind? The agreement has no prospect
of permanency, no promise for the future,
and I am in accord with the remark made by
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) that sooner or later the entire
subject will have to be reviewed and changes
made along the lines I have indicated. The
sooner that is done, honourable senators,
in my judgment the better it will be for
this country.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I had not intended to say a word in this
debate, but I am induced to offer one
observation as a result of statements which
have been made by speakers who have
preceded me this afternoon.
Every one,
without exception, has said it is a bad principle, and one which should be avoided
at all costs, that one government shall do
the taxing and hand the money over to
another government to spend, and it seems
to be assumed that the agreements which we
are now asked to ratify are, in that they
create that supposedly viclous principle, a
new departure. I would point out to my
honourable friends that the position is
absolutely different from and completely
contrary to that. The principle of one
government raising money for another to
spend is written right into the British
North America Act. It was determined at
the time of confederation that the federal
government, from the revenues it collected

JUNE 26. 1952
through taxation, should pay to each province on a per capita basis an amount which
was then expected to cover substantially
the whole of the provincial expenditures.
My honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) predicted that as a consequence
of these agreements friction would occur
between the federal government and the
As a matter of
provincial governments.
history, ever since confederation there has
been friction between the provincial governments and the federal governments on precisely that point-the amount of the subsidy
which the federal government should pay.
I believe that confederation had been in
existence only two years when the provincial
governments demanded increased subsidies.
So I cannot see any force in the argument
that these agreements we are now making
with the provinces will increase friction. The
friction has always been there.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable senator if he will admit that there is
a difference between a subsidy granted by
the federal government to the provinces and
grants to the provinces for education and
other purposes?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes. I am not
dealing with that matter; I am dealing purely
with the agreements between the fedèral
government and the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: There was no agreement
under the British North America Act to
do what it is now proposed to do. The
power that the federal government is using
to collect the money is borrowed. When
you borrow a thing you generally return it.
It was borrowed first by Borden, then by
King, and it has never been returned. If
you borrow a thing and keep it permanently
it is not borrowing, it is stealing; and the
right of taxation is being stolen from the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: When I steal something
from somebody I take it without his permission and against his will. How can I be
accused of stealing when I make an agreement
with a man to temporarily hand over something to me? I do not think my honourable
friend's simile has any validity whatever.
Hon. Mr. Reid: One can take something
from an innocent child with his consent, and
it is still theft.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think the provincial governments are as innocent and as
childish as all that.
I merely wanted to point out, honourable
senators, that the principle of one government
taxing and handing the money over to another
government is not so vicious and dreadful as
some honourable senators wish to make the

house believe. It is a principle upon which
confederation was founded, and has been continued ever since.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is my honourable friend
arguing that the granting of subsidies at the
time of confederation is on all fours with
these agreements?
Hon. Mr, Hugessen: I think the principle
is exactly the sane.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As a matter of fact, by
these agreements we are getting closer to the
position which was taken at confederation,
when the federal government was supposed to
be collecting practically the whole of the
taxes required by the provincial governments
to enable them to carry on.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The analogy is not a good
one.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
may disagree with me, but I think the analogy
is extremely pertinent. I am not trying to
make any great show of it. All I am doing
is to point out that for one government to
receive taxes for another government to
spend is not some new and dreadful principle, and to be rejected on that account.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If ever I required an advocate I would take you.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
under the circumstances, and in the brief time
at my disposal, I shall make no attempt to
discuss the general principle underlying this
question. As has been pointed out, the problem is a difficult one, but I thoroughly agree
with the deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
in his statement that the principle involved
is by no means a new one. Certainly it has
existed since confederation, and indeed before
confederation. I just happened to glance at
the report of the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, and I found there
a reference to the discussions which took place
in Quebec in the year 1864 in connection with
the basis of revenues for the four provinces
which then comprised confederation. I quote
from page 60 of book 1 of the report:
The allocation of functions and revenues discussed
at Quebec in 1864 meant roughly that the provinces
would be left with $11 million of local revenues to
meet an estimated $4 million of local outlay while
the Dominion was to be given $12 million in revenue
to meet less than $9 million in outlay. It was proposed to balance the provincial budgets by transferring $21 million to the provinces in the form of
federal subsidies.

This system of allocation of functions and
revenues, discussed at Quebec as long ago
as 1864 is still continuing, and in principle

SENATE
mne legislation now before the house is just
a part of this continuing system. I shall not
undertake to say whether or not some new
method of allocating revenues can be devised.
The honourable gentleman from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has said that sooner or
later this entire subject will have to be
reviewed and changes made along certain
lines that he indicated; and indeed, if at some
time the Finance Committee is looking for
something to do it might well address itself
to this problem.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am speaking only
of the four original provinces under confederation-Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Quebec and Ontario.
In 1868, the first year after confederation,
59 -7 per cent of all Quebec revenues came
from federal subsidies, and the figures in the
case of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Ontario were 68-5 per cent, 76-0 per cent
and 30 per cent respectively. These percentages were pretty constant for the first fifteen
years following confederation, but they

THE ESTIMATES
APPENDIX No.

1

The Standing Committee on Finance, to whom were referred the Estimates
laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending March 31st, 1953, reports as
follows:On March 26th, 1952, the following Order passed the Senate:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be authorized to examine
the expenditures proposed by the Estimates laid before Parliament for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1953, in advance of the Bills based on
the said Estimates reaching the Senate; that it be empowered to send
for records of revenues from taxation collected by the Federal, Provincial and Municipal Governments in Canada and the incidence of this
taxation in its effect upon different income groups, and records of
expenditures by such governments, showing sources of income and
expenditures of same under appropriate headings, together with estimates
of gross national production, net national income and movement of the
cost-of-living index, and their relation to such total expenditures, for
the year 1939 and for the latest year for which the information is
available, and such other matters as may be pertinent to the examination
of the Estimates, and to report upon the same.
That the said Committee be empowered to send for persons, papers
and records.
Due to the Senate adjournment for the Easter recess, Your Committee did
not begin its enquiry until the beginning of May.
At its first meeting Your Committee decided that in a general way the
enquiry should be made along the same lines as last year and, with this in view,
data were secured similar to that provided a year ago. This added another year
for study and comparison. Appended to this report, therefore, are several
exhibits which, if studied with care, present a fair picture, not only of the
Federal Government's revenues and expenditures, but that of the Provinces
and Municipalities as well.
All Canadians, wherever they may be, pay taxes to three governing
authorities, Municipal, Provincial and Federal. They tend to look at each
one of these apart from the others, whereas the really important thing for the
Canadian taxpayer is not the taxation he has to meet from each of these
governing authorities, but what he has to meet from all combined. It may be
added here that the data provided in these exhibits come from official sources,
mainly from the Bureau of Statistics which has a wealth of information on all
aspects of the Canadian economy.

Exhibit I in the appendices gives an analysis of the main estimates submitted by the Government during the present session of Parliament by standard
objects and special categories of expenditures. This, with the explanatory
notes attached tp it, gives a clear picture of how the Government proposes to
spend the money entrusted to it. Your Committee was helped much in its
inquiry by the detailed analyses by Departments of the total of these standard
objects and special categories which were included in the book of estimates

SENATE
submitted to Parliament. The general pictures can be seen in the Table attached
as Exhibit I. As examples: It will be noted that the total money required for
travel and removal expenses for ail government purposes is well over 46
million dollars, of which just about 14 millions is for purely civilian needs and
52 millions for defence and defence production. Your Committee feels certain
that this amount of 46 million dollars could be sharply reduced without injury
to the public interest. As another example, we take office stationery, supplies,
equipment and furnishings. Here 18 million dollars is provided, of which over
12 millions is for purely civilian purposes. Surely ail this could be much
reduced without hurt to efficient administration.
We draw attention also to a few other items of substantial increase in the
estimates for the present fiscal year as against the previous year. In the item
of materials and supplies the increase is from approximately 39 million dollars
to over 43 million dollars. Under the heading of construction or acquisition of
buildings, the total amount spent in the last fiscal year was 127 million dollars,
which increases this year to 136 million dollars, or an additional 9 million
dollars. Under repairs and upkeep, a similar increase is approximately one
million, four hundred thousand dollars. Under the item of rentals the increase
for the present year as against the last is 750 thousand dollars. That is, in the
present year the estimates provide for spending 750 thousand dollars more for
renting premises for government purposes than the previous year. It should
be borne in mind that these increases are for purely civilian purposes apart
from defence and defence production, and are at a time when the strains are
heavy upon our economy for the latter purposes. Governments are more often
criticized because they spend too little than because they spend too much, and
too often those in opposition to government criticize the governments they
oppose because more money is not being spent for roads, or welfare, or hospitals, this or that or the other thing.
Your Committee believes that there needs to be a new approach everywhere to the business of public spending. The increasing tendency of people
to demand that the government do something about ail kinds of problems
which the community or the individual should solve for itself or himself is, we
believe, accountable for much mounting public expenditure and, if not checked,
bids fair to undermine our present system of government.
A further observation requires to be made here. We draw attention to the
items in the civilian Estimates that have to do with the construction or acquisition of buildings and works, their repairs and their upkeep, and rentals for
buildings which different Government Departments require. The total amount
under these three items found in the Public Works Department Estimates is
slightly in excess of 80 million dollars. The total for ail Departments of
Government under these items is in excess of 163 millions. Under the Public
Works Act, the Public Works Department of Canada has the responsibility of
providing and maintaining ail the public buildings and works required by the
other Civilian Departments. It is true Part II of the Public Works Act makes
an exception to the effect that the Governor in Council "may at any time
transfer the management, charge and direction of any public work, or any
power, duty or function with respect to any class of works, whether public or
private, which is assigned to or vested by Statute in any Minister or Department, to any other Minister of Department." But surely this was only intended
to meet special circumstances, and was never intended to be used in the broad
sense in which it is used today.
From the figures just quoted, it would appear that other Departments of
Government combined are directly spending more for these purposes than the
Public Works Department which is primarily charged with thig responsibility.
For example, the Post Office Department, which requires public buildings all
over Canada, either through building or rental for Post Office purposes, and
requires to have them repaired and maintained, has ahl this work done by the

JUNE 26, 1952

Public Works Department, as was intended under the Act. The question
naturally arises, why should this not be done for other civilian Departments of
Government ? When, for example, the Department of Agriculture, or National
Revenue, or National Health and Welfare, directly provides for their own
needs by building, or rental or both, they have to provide their own architects,
their own engineers, and their own servicing establishment generally. It certainly appears that this can have no other effect than duplication and overlapping and the inevitable general increase in costs that is bound to result from
this practice.
There are exceptions in the case of Departments which have services
abroad. The office space and maintenance which they require abroad will be
secured more economically by such-a Department directly. But practically all
of these expenditures, to which attention is drawn, are within Canada and,
with very few exceptions, as for example the maintenance of buildings and
roads in National Parks, we do feel that this part of the administration of our
public business should be under Public Works.
In Exhibit II will be found the combined revenues and expenditures of all
Governments in Canada for the year 1939, taken as a base year, and for the
years 1949 and 1950, with the sources from which governments obtained their
revenue and the purposes for which they spent it. Since the Public Finance
Division of the Bureau of Statistics has not the complete data for 1951, only
preliminary estimates are given for this year. For 1952 comparable data for
all governments have yet to be unfolded; but Your Committee thinks it is a fair
assumption that for this present year all governments combined will take from
Canadian taxpayers in excess of 6 billion dollars, and will spend somewhat
short of that amount.
In the Federal field the need for increased revenue and, as a result,
increased taxation, arises mainly from rapidly expanding defence expenditures,
which this year will be over 2 billion dollars; and expanding welfare costs
which, for the same period, if we include soldiers' pensions and allowances, at
all levels of government, will be at least 1½ billions of dollars, of which more
than two-thirds is for Federal account. Of this latter amount two items, Old
Age Pensions with Pensions for the Blind, and Family Allowances, will require
over 675 million dollars.
In this connection it is interesting to note that in the year 1951 the
Canadian people spent, on
(1) Alcoholic beverages ................
$ 651,000,000.00
(2) Tobacco in various forms ........... .
422,000,000.00
(3) Race track betting..................
55,000,000.00
(4) Soft drink beverages of all kinds .....
158,000,000.00
(5) Commercial recreation ............. .
160,000,000.00
or a total of ..................

$l,446,000,000.00

This total is almost equal to the total amount spent under the general
heading of Social Security. It is sometimes argued that the taxes collected for
Social Security goes back directly to the taxpayers, and so should be regarded as
a sort of credit to the taxpayers accounts. But this is not so. The money
collected in taxes for security benefits, in large aggregate, passes from the
taxpayer to a different person. We are not concerned here with the merits or
demerits of this, but simply to say that on any reasonable basis it can only be
regarded as part of the tax burden.
Your Committee thinks that in a young country like Canada, with its
immense resources and with greater opportunity for the individual to make his

SENATE

way than can be found in any other part of the world, Social Security measures
as a whole should be reviewed and assessed in the light of sound national
development.
Exhibit III deals with the figures on national income and gross national
product, and data is given for all the yars from 1939 to and including 1951.
Perhaps, for the purposes of clarity, the distinction between gross national
product and net national income should be repeated here. Gross national
product is the total gross income of all the people of Canada from all sources,
which can be compared to the gross income of a business corporation, a farmer
or a labouring man. To arrive at the net national income, certain deductions must be made from the gross product. In the course of a year
machinery employed to produce the gross national product has to be depreciated, since all machinery tends to wear out within a limited time. The same
thing is true of bouses and automobiles. When all these and similar charges
are put together they are deducted from the gross product. The result may
be described as the net national income.
It is out of this net national income that all people in Canada meet their
total living expenses and, since Canadians enjoy a high standard of living,
this amount is the major item. In the second place, there has to be deducted
the amount all citizens pay to their various Governments in taxes. Speaking
generally, what is left is the volume of savings, which may be invested in life
insurance policies, Bonds of Governments or of Corporations, or annuities, or
in business undertakings of one kind and another, or retained by individual
Canadians as a protection against their future needs.
Here we must pay a well deserved compliment to the Minister of Finance
who, in his annual budget speech, and especially in the white paper that
accompanied the budget statement, gave a vast amount of information on how
and why the Canadian economy is working at the highest level reached in our
whole history. The Minister estimated that our gross national product for the
present fiscal period would be about 22J billion dollars. This should leave a
net national income of approximately 18 billion dollars. If we could be certain
that our economy would continue to expand as it has done in recent years,
your Committee thinks that Canadians could feel reasonably secure for their
future; but we should recognize clearly also that, if cold and chilling winds
blow upon us, the result might be greatly different. Indeed, the Minister
drew attention to this possibility in his budget speech when he said "Every
Honourable Member will agree, I hope, that it is not possible to predict with
certainty the level of prices during any future twelve months to within 1 per
cent. Yet, on a gross national product of 20 billion dollars, the difference
between a 1 per cent rise and a 1 per cent fall in prices during the year is a
difference of 400 million dollars in gross national product. Under our present
tax structure, such a slight change in price could produce a difference of from
80 to 85 million dollars in our revenues": This is a significant and important
statement.
It is well to remember that if our economy remains buoyant, and we
reach 18 billion dollars of net national income, the Canadian people will
pay in taxes for this period, to all their governments, just about one-third of
this amount. Everyone will admit that this heavy burden of taxation, brought
about in a substantial degree by the large defence spending, is certainly about
the limit, or even beyond the limit that Governments can with safety take
from the taxpayers. We have no guarantee that, so far as our economy is
concerned, we shall continue indefinitely to live in the sunshine. It should be
kept in mind that about half the increase that has taken place in our gross
national product, and therefore in our net national income, over the last twelve
years, has been due to the persistent inflation of our economy. On the value

JUNE 26, 1952
of the pre-war dollar, the total representing product and income would be
about half what they are today. This is equally true of other countries as
well.
Amid all the good times we have experienced in recent years, it should
never be forgotten that the Canadian economy is very vulnerable in one
important aspect, and that is in our continued ability to sell our products
abroad. We have now daily evidence in this matter through the effects produced by exchange difficulty in the sterling area. We see emerging once more,
since the end of the war, the tendency toward further restrictions on trade by
some of the countries in which we ordinarily sell a large amount of our
surplus. If, for the reasons just cited and for other reasons which might be
added, we find increasing difficulty in getting into the markets of the world,
then there is little doubt of the effect it will produce on our economy at home.
We have seen the effect produced by foot and mouth disease where our large
market for cattle in the United States has been completely shut off for the
time being. Ordinarily, British Columbia and Eastern Canada sell much of
their forest products in the sterling area. For reasons already stated, this
market has been greatly curtailed. These are instances of what might happen
to us. These are the imponderables which largely influence the manner in
which our economy operates. If we lose a market, as is the case for the time
being with our livestock, or if we lose our markets for forest products, or for
any of our other products, almost certainly someone will demand to know
what some government or other proposes to do about it. If the government
gives the relief that may be demanded it can only be done at the expense of
the taxpayers. And if this attitude of mind, so prevalent in recent years, which
in increasing degree demands that some government or other must find a solution for the problems of the individual, or the community, continues to grow,
and as far as possible to be met, we are assuredly on the slippery slope that
will land us in ever increasing difficulties. If, within the next few years, we
should have a 20 per cent decline in prices, or lose 20 per cent of our foreign
markets, what happens to the edifice of expenditures we have built up in the
days of sunshine? This problem is worth thinking about. Moreover, the
gaining of world markets and increased trade means competition. This in
turn involves cost of production, and here labour costs is the most important
item. There is abundant evidence to show that notwithstanding the increase
in prices that has taken place since the end of the war, labour generally has
quite substantially improved its position. In other words, notwithstanding
the increase in prices, what labour receives today for a day's work will buy
substantially more than what labour received six years ago for a similar day's
work; and it should not be overlooked either that the business corporation, be
it large or small, or the individual business man looking after his own business
will as far as he possibly can put into the price of goods he sells the increased
costs that have to be provided in the carrying on of business. This applies
in an equal degree to the taxes that business generaly has to pay. Wherever
possible they are passed on to the consumer and this, in the conduct of human
affairs, is inevitable, human nature being what it is.
Without question Canada is at one of the great crossroads of its history.
Without question the essence of the struggle between free men and the autocratic states is the maintenance of our personal freedom and liberty. In the
short view this is obscured by the individual's concern with his personal
affairs. As a people we may be thinking too much of security for the moment,
and not enough of where we will be if the dark forces of tyranny overwhelm
us. We are thinking too much of our enjoyments, of what we can get rather
than what we can give. In the long run these are the things that vitally
matter. In a society where the tendency is for each group to scramble for all
it can get, regardless of its effect on others, we have in the present state of
world affairs a society that may be headed for the abyss.

SENATE
Exhibit IV-as an appendix to this report-covers reported numbers of
employees of the Government of Canada, excluding members of the Armed
Forces and the R.C.M.P., as at March 31st, 1939, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951 and
1952. From this appendix it will be noted that between March 31st, 1951, and
the corresponding date in 1952, the total employees of the Government of Canada increased by just about 13,000. Of this increase slightly more than 10,000
is in the services of the Defence Department (it should be kept in mind that
these are civilian employees), and the total in the Defence Department has now
reached almost 40,000. The Wartime Prices and Trade Board, which reported
260 employees a year ago, has been wound up. A study of this Table will indicate where the other increases over the past year have taken place. These
increases outside the Defence Department can be laid at the door of expanding
Government services. The increased cost is not confined to the increase in
Government servants. It means increased demands for office space and increasing costs for all the things the servants need to do their work.
While Your Committee recognizes that an increasing population may
require correspondingly increased expenses by governments at all levels, nevertheless the increasing costs of the whole apparatus of Government in Canada
is a matter for concern. Here the truth needs to be recognized-that if the
people demand more services from their Municipalities, their Provincial Governments, or the Federal Government, they must expect that their taxes will have
to be increased. While Your Committee has no data on what is happening in
this respect at the Provincial and Municipal level, we still think it fair to say
that these increasing costs of Government administration will be found, with
exceptions here and there, in all levels of the vast mechanism of Government
in this country. If the public insists that the administrative costs of Governments be reduced-as many think they should-it cannot reach this desirable
end unless it rids itself of the idea that governments have to dance when it
calls the tune or more expenditures.
In Exhibit V will be found the movement of the cost-of-living index from
the year 1945 down to the present time, with the changes recorded month by
month for 1950, 1951 and 1952 to March lst. Since the latter date a further
slight reduction has taken place. The movement of this cost-of-living index
reflects the inflation that has taken place since 1945, where the index stood at
119-5 compared with 1935 to 1939, as represented by 100. During the war years
the cost-of-living was held stable because of the controls over wages, salaries,
and prices maintained during the war; the increase of 19·5 points having
occurred before these controls were made effective in November, 1941. There
are those who urge a return to control of prices but this, without a similar
control on wages and salaries, would not be worth the paper it was written on.
The further inflation which seriously threatened-even a year ago-has
been brought under a measure of control. But while the forces of inflation have
apparently been checked, they may easily flare up again. The possibilities of
further inflation in the United States appear to be by no means over. The
prospect there is for a heavy government deficit and, when governments do
not pay their way, the result is bound to be inflationary. In addition, labour in
the United States is demanding sharply increased wages-definitely another
inflationary factor. In Canada we may still face demands of a similar kind. If
further inflation should take place in the U.S., Canada could not escape the consequences of it. About all that can be said is that we have no clear chartered
course before us. We do not know from which direction the gales may come
upon us; yet we can safely assume that if we practice moderation in our own
personal expenditures, and if our governments practice care and economy in the
spending of the funds the taxpayers have given them, we will have at least
taken in some measure some protection against the uncertainties of the future.

JUNE 26, 1952

Mr. Gilbert Jackson, a well-known Economist of Toronto, in giving evidence
before Your Committee, all of which is reported in the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Committee, stated that to increase the gross national product by one
dollar required that almost five dollars be saved and invested. Mr. Jackson's
data to support this impressed the Committee with its soundness. Your Committee also had as a witness Mr. Monteath Douglas, Director of the Canadian
Tax Foundation, whose head office is in Toronto. Mr. Douglas also gave the
Committee useful information and it likewise can be found in the Minutes of
the Proceedings.
As a result of our enquiry, we suggest the following recommendations:
(1) There has been an increasing volume of publications from Government Departments. Your Committee feels that much of this is unnecessary
and useless and should be completely overhauled. We recommend strongly
that Departments be required to budget for their postage and that the
franking privilege-now general among all Departments for the stuff
they imagine they need to send out to the public-should be restricted
wholly to the personal mail of Members of Parliament when Parliament
is in session. This would tend to limit the publication of material to what
was necessary and useful. Consideration should be given by the Government to making a fair charge for necessary Government publications,
such as geological surveys, maps and scientific publications, and the like.
(2) The growing practice for other Departments of Government to
bypass Public Works Department and build up little Public Works branches
of their own, should cease, and all such work placed in charge of the Public
Works Department, where the law intended it should be.
(3) We suggest that beneficial results would follow the holding of a
Conference between the Provinces and the Federal authority for the
purpose of finding where economies, as between their administrations,
could be brought about. We believe important savings in the cost of
government as a whole could be found, with important benefits to the
Governments concerned, and their taxpayers as well.
This brings us to the conclusion of our report:
That the tax burdens of the Canadian people are heavy no one will deny.
At the Federal level we propose to spend 2,000 million dollars, or about $4.00
out of every $9.00 for defence, and no one can say how long we shall have
to sustain this burden. With the passing of time the conflicts between those
countries where freedom has entirely disappeared and the freedom-loving
Western nations certainly are not growing less, but are becoming deeper and
more intense. It is not given to mankind today to know what will come out
of ail this turmoil and conflict; but if we are wise we shall realize that we may
have to live in this kind of world for many years to come. If we are to win out
in the end-along with the nations associated with us-we must keep our
resolution strong and our vision clear. There are no saner, steadier people
anywhere in the world than the Canadian people, and they must have
courageous leadership to guide them along the right paths. In these dangerous
days we cannot have both ease and sacrifice. If we put both ease and security
first-and if the other Western nations do the same-then undoubtedly in the
end we will have lost our ease and security because we have lost our freedom.
Your Committee wishes to express its thanks to all the witnesses who
appeared before it for the assistance they gave to the Committee in carrying
on its work.
All which is respectfully submitted,
T. A. CRERAR,
Chairman.

Exhibit No. 1
SUMMARY 0F ANNUAL ESTIMATES
BY STANDARD OBJECTS 0F EXPENDITURE AND SPECIAL CATEGORIES
This Summary, which is similar in form to the one prepared in the spring
of 1951, sets out, by Standard Objects and Special Categories, the provision
included in the Estimates for the current and certain previous years. The detail
for the current year (1952-53) has been taken direetly from the "Summary of
Standard Objects of Expenditure and Special Categories" which is enclosed in
an envelope at the back of the Blue Book of Estimates for 1952-53. The
figures for 1951-52 exceed those shown on that "Summary" because they
have been increased by the amounts incîuded in the Further Supplementary
Estimates (2) and (3), 1951-52, which were passed on April 1, 1952. For
each past year, total Estimates are shown in each case.
As was indicated in the notes concerning the Summary which was prepared
last year, the Estimates for 1949-50 and 1938-39 were not susceptible to
accurate classification on this basis as the Estimates of more recent years
have been because the breakdowns for those years did not conformn in al
instances to the Standard Objeet pattern. Where accurate classification was
not possible, judgment was exercised in deciding where to include the items
in question. Moreover, in some places, where provision was made for a
combination of purposes now covered by separate Standard Objeets, it was
only possible to arrive at a rough proportionate breakdown among the Objects
now used.
Minor adjustments have also been made in the figures for 1951-52 where
Objects have since been re-defined in an effort to improve the classification
but, apart fromn four major readjustments, it bas not been thought worth while
to carry minor adjustments back into the figures for the earlier years, because
such adjustments require a disproportionate expense in tracing details in various
departments.

COMBINED REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES-ALL GOVERNMENTS
IN CANADA
Fiscal Years Ended Nearest December 31st, 1939, 1949 and 1950
STATEMENTS

ATTACHED

Source: 1939-"Comparative Statistics of Public Finance", prepared for
the Dominion-Provincial Conference on Reconstruction, 1945.
1949 and 1950-Based on compilations of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics
and Bank of Canada, for comparative purposes.
Explanatory Note: The totals appearing on line 23 of the revenue table
and line 18 of the expenditure table do not include intergovernment transfers.
For instance, subsidies authorized by the B.N.A. Act and other Acts and compensation to provinces as provided in the Dominion-Provincial Tax Rental
Agreements Act are excluded from expenditures of the Federal government
and correspondingly omitted from the revenues of the provinces. However,
grants-in-aid, etc., for specific services, such as for old age pensions, are
included as expenditures of the government making the grant and deducted
from the gross expenses of the other level of government which received the
grant.
These procedures are followed to avoid duplication in order to produce
additive totals of both revenues and expenditures for all levels of government.

SENATE

THE SENATE

Friday, June 27, 1952
The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
MEMBERS

OF PARLIAMENT RETIRING
ALLOWANCES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 392, an Act to provide
retiring allowances on a contributory basis,
to persons who have served as members
of the House of Commons of Canada.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: With leave
of the Senate, I move the second reading
now.
This bill, honourable senators, is not
government legislation in the ordinary sense
of the term. It is true that it was introduced
in the House of Commons, by the Prime
Minister, under constitutional provisions,
largely to implement what was the desire of
an overwhelming majority of the members
of that house. I desire to make some observations on the general outline of the plan,
and to give the background of certain matters
relating to the other house which are of
primary interest to the members of this
house. This measure, of course, mainly concerns the other place, but as this house is
called upon to consider it, I shall do my best
to explain the plan for which it makes
provision.
1. Members:
(a) For current service each member would
contribute 6 per cent of each sessional
indemnity received, and he would continue
to make payments until his total contributions were equal to one sessional indemnity,
namely, $4,000.
This would take slightly
less than seventeen sessions to accomplish.
If a member's contributions reach $4,000, and
the sessional indemnity is later increased,
he can resume his contributions until the
new level is reached.
(b) A member may contribute for the
whole or part of his prior service at the
rate of 6 per cent of the indemnity actually
received during that service, together with
interest at 4 per cent compounded annually

from the close of each session. When a
member elects to contribute for prior service,
his arrears, including the compound interest,
will be calculated as a lump sum, and he
can pay it off immediately or over a period
of time, but be will be required to pay
4 per cent interest on the balance each year.
This interest payment will be deducted from
his sessional indemnity. Any balance which
a member owes at the time his pension is
due to begin will be defrayed by withholding
all pension payments until the sum withheld
equals the balance owing.
2. Government:
The government will match the member's
contributions for both current and prior service, and will pay 4 per cent interest each
year on the balance which is in the Members
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Account.
3. Benefits:
(i) When eligible, a member will receive an
annual allowance equal to 75 per cent of the
total contributions he has made, not including
any interest. On the present basis this would
provide a maximum annuity of $3,000-75
per cent of $4,000. At the age of 70 any
pension received as a member of parliament
would be reduced by any pension payable
under the Old Age Security Act.
(ii) If ineligible to receive an annual allowance, a member may receive on his retirement
from the house a refund of his contributions,
exclusive of any interest which he bas paid.
(iii) If a member is expelled from the
house, he will receive a refund of his contribution, exclusive of any interest which
he had paid.
(iv) On the death of a member, or former
member, his total contributions less any pension payments already made will be refunded
to his estate.
4. Eligibility for Pension:
To be eligible for a yearly allowance a
member will have to have contributed or
have elected to contribute for service in more
than two parliaments; however, no pension is
payable during any period in which a former
member of the House of Commons is serving
as a senator, a judge, or a commissioner, or
in any position in a government or Crown
company. The pension would resume when
suàh service to the Crown came to an end,
except in cases where a judge's pension was
being paid.
The effective date of this bill is to be the
beginning of the next session.
Though the subject is not one of primary
concern to us, for the purpose of securing
information I asked three questions about the

JUNE 27, 1952
position of a senator wbo, before his appointment as such, was a member of the House of
Commons.
First: What is the position of a member
of the House of Commons who is appointed to
the Senate bef are he is eligible to receive
an allowance under section II, subsection (1)
of the bill; that is, after he has started to
contrîbute but before he is eligible? The
answer is, that should he be appointed to
the Senate, under these circumstances 12e
shall receive a return of his contributions
without interest.
Second: What is the position of a former
member of the House of Commons who
ceases to be a member of that house, is
eligible ta receive an allowance under section 1l, subsection (1), and receives it for
same time prior ta his appointment ta the
Senate? The answer is that his allowance is
discontinued while he is a senator. If 12e
resigns from the Senate the allowance
Should he die while
will be resumed.
a senator, his estate will receive an amount
equal ta the difference between the total
of his contributions, without interest, and the
total of any amounts of allowance which had
been paid or had become payable ta hlm
priar ta bis death.
Third: What is the position of a member of
the House of Commons who is appointed ta
the Senate immediately upon bis resignation
from the House o! Commons and is otherwise eligible ta receive a pension under section 11, subsection (1)? The answer is that
the allowance ta which he is otherwise
entitled is suspended immediately, and will
commence at such time as he may resign
from the Senate; and if he dies whlle a senator, hîs estate will receive a return of bis
contributions on the basis described in the
reply ta question 2. That is, he will be in
exactly the same position as one who bas
received the allowance, except that, if he
bas received notbing, the amount to be
credited to his estate will be more. than be
would be entitled ta if he had received an
allowance for a certain periad.
That, so far as I know, covers all the points
which seem pertinent. Personally, as one
who is not affected in any way, I feel that
this legisiation is reasonable, just and long
overdue. The honesty of the overwhelming
majority of those of all parties engaged in
the public life o! Canada is undoubted and
should be, and I believe is, a matter of
national pride. That provision should be
made for the needs of their later years, ta
the cost of which they themselves contribute,
is, in my opinion, no more than simple justice.
I have always been impressed by financial institutions, particularly banks. Their

employees are trained ta provide the rest of
us wi'th financial advîce, but the question
of providing for their retirement is taken
out of their hands, and from the date they
commence to work for these institutions they
are required to make contributions to a
pension fund, and these contributions are
matched by the financial institutions.
Honourable senators, I feel that the principle o! this legislation is saund, and I cammend it ta the favourable consideration of
this bouse.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill
was read the second time.

the details of the Criminal Code. Honourable senators may not now appreciate how
much detailed work was done by this subcommittee, but they undoubtedly will when
the Criminal Code Bill is introduced early
next session. Each member of the committee
contributed his best effort, but I should like
to refer particularly to the chairman of the
committee (Hon. Mr. Hayden) and to the
honourable senators from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) and Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), and to the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Also, I should like to express a word of
appreciation of the work of the Divorce Committee. Unfortunately I was not in the house
on Wednesday when the committee's final
report of the session was presented. The
deputy leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) expressed
at that time the Senate's deep appreciation
of the work done by the committee. I wish
to add my tribute to his. I have been more
grateful than I can say to the members of
the Divorce Committee, and particularly to
the chairman (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), for the
willingness with which they performed the
long and tedious job of hearing evidence in
divorce cases.
I wish also to mention
especially the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), who has made his services available to the committee. In the circumstances,
it would not be unreasonable if he declined
to give of his time to this unpleasant task.
I am sure that I speak for all members of
the Senate when I say that we sincerely
appreciate the conscientious work that the
Divorce Committee has done in the past, and
are sure that the committee will serve with
equal faithfulness in the future so long as
the responsibility of hearing divorce petitions
rests upon the Senate.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Finance, to whom were referred the Estimates laid before parliament for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1953.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
move that this report be concurred in.
My first words after moving concurrence
must be of thanks to the committee which sat
through practically two months, heard quite
a number of witnesses, studied a considerable amount of data, and did so with a
harmony that I have never seen excelled in
my parliamentary experience. Not that there
were not differences of opinion, but the

approach of the committee throughout its
task was on a high level of co-operation, and,
as chairman, I must express my thanks to
the committee members.
In dealing with this report may I at the
outset make a reference to the general conditions that we find in the world today? If
we take stock of political and economic conditions, we see a world that is in turmoil
and confusion, and full of doubt and uncertainties as to the future. It is not necessary
for me to relate to the members of this house
the reasons for that state of affairs. We see
the world divided into two vast camps,
mutually antagonistic, not alone in the field
of their ordinary relationships, but waging
a great confiict of ideals, a great conflict
indeed for the soul of humanity in the future.
That this is due to Russian policy needs
scarcely to be said. For some strange reason,
the Russian mentality has seized upon the
ideal of communism as a means of bolstering
and strengthening throughout the world the
ideas that communists represent. One can
understand the philosophy of communism,
even though disagreeing with it; but what
we see is not so much devotion to the ideal
of the communist philosophy. That has been
replaced by the most naked, imperialism the
world has ever seen.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And in this vast struggle

that is being played upon the world stage
we have seen so far only the opening phases.
That Russia is building up her military power
cannot be questioned. That she endeavours
to dominate every country within the range
of her interest, cannot be questioned either.
We see the Far Eastern part of Asia in a
ferment, not so much because of the propagation of the communist philosophy, but because
of the endeavour to enlarge the sphere of
Russian influence and power. We see India
subjected to this campaign of infiltration; and
the same thing is going on in the Near East,
and in Europe. Indeed, it may be said that
outside of the North American and the South
American continents, these gigantic forces
are in conflict everywhere today, and there
is no visible sign that the conflict will be
resolved at an early date.
We have today a war of nerves. Russia,
by confusing the public opinion of the nations,
by playing upon their fears and susceptibilities in every direction, is steadily endeavouring to undermine the whole concept of
freedom and liberty throughout the world.
That is what is happening. Now, we cannot
be blind to the fact that the nature of that
struggle, of the Russian attack, has a terrifie
impact upon the world at large. The western

large defence expenditures. I am not criticizing those expenditures; we can not avoid
them. To attempt to shirk our responsibilities in this respect would only imperil our
freedom and liberty in the future. I believe
the most important obligation of the Canadian people, and of all freedorn-loving nations
in the world, is to maintain that freedom and
liberty. By freedom and liberty I mean
the right to go about our ordinary vocations
and live within an ordered law of our own
making, the right to worship as we please
and freely carry on our discussions of public
affairs. These are the priceless things which
in the generations of men who have passed
on were achieved by the shedding of much
blood, and these are the things which above
all else we must guard and cherish. A greater
degree of inflation might carry us along for
some time, but in the end it could only produce very grave results. We all hope that
the inflation which has been so much in
evidence during the last five or six years is
now under control, but I am bound to admit
that anyone who reviews the world situation
today cannot hold that hope without reservations. If world economic conditions grow
worse, and if as a consequence our markets
contract and we are unable to find adequate
outlets for the products of Canadian labour
and industry we may face a situation in
which our economic wellbeing, instead of
increasing, will decline. To my mind one of
the most significant statements in the budget
speech was the one quoted in our report,
wherein Mr. Abbott warned the House of
Commons that a shift in prices of one per
cent either way would mean a difference of
$400 million in our total gross product and
this in turn would affect the federal revenues
of the country to the extent of from $80
million to $85 million.
If that statement signifies anything, it
means that we are walking along a perilous
ledge. In the light of that fact, which this
report tries to emphasize, I think the Canadian people today are taking things rather
too easily; they are proceeding too much on
the assumption that everything is always
going to be lovely. But if, on the contrary,
we were to lose our markets to any serious
extent, if the price level should decline, and
if our revenues consequently should fall as
they almost certainly would, we would be
faced with either increased taxation or deficits, or both. That consideration applies not
only to the federal government but ta every
government,
provincial
and
municipal,
throughout this country. All would be in the
same boat. So we should try as far as possible
to be prepared against that eventuality.
I do not believe there is any alternative to
the old-fashioned remedy of economy, not

only in personal spending but in public
spending. Today, on all levels of government,
with this huge defence expenditure of two
billion dollars a year hanging over us, we
must economize in every possible way. As the
report points out, taxation now absorbs about
one-third of our net national income. Six
thousand million dollars is a great deal of
money for the Canadian people to pay in
taxes, and it is incumbent upon everyone
who is charged with responsibilities in this
connection to so order the public business
that the tax burden shall be as light as possible, and wherever practicable shall be
reduced. There is no question, with the kind
of world we are living in today, that uncertainty and doubt and fear will be with us
for several years to cone. Personally I am
under no illusion that our defence expenditures will be limited to one year, or two
years, or three. If present conditions continue
-and their possibilities in terns of danger
need scarcely be stressed to members of this
house-we shall probably be spending as
much three years hence as we are doing
today.
I wish to say a word or two about the
recommendations which have been made in
the report.
The first has to do with the quantity of
printed, productions which issues from government departments. It will be recalled by
members of the committee that during the
progress of our inquiry a request was made
for a list of all the publications issued by
departments of government in the last fiscal
year. As I recall, the request came from the
honourable senator from Dartmouth-Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) and was made to Mr. Bryce,
the secretary of the Treasury Board. Naturally the preparation of this list took a considerable time, and it was only yesterday
that I received it. Here it is; and when you
look through it I think you will agree that
every kind of publication which one can
imagine is included. I have not had the
opportunity to study it closely, but in glancing over it I wondered how we manage to
get along with only one printing bureau; it
looks as though two or three plants would be
needed. How much of this output is necessary? That is a question to which some study
should be given.
One recommendiation of the committee is
that all departments should be obliged to
budget for their postage. The only exception
-and this, for special and sufficient reasons
-is the personal mail of members of parliament while parliament is in session, the only
period in which the franking privilege is
available to them. I venture to say that if
government departments were required to

JUNE 27, 1952
budget for their postage the number of publications listed in this return could be reduced
by nearly fifty per cent.
The next recommendation deals with a
practice-and it is not new, for it has been
developing over a great many years-whereby departments of government perform for
themselves such functions as the construction,
maintenance and upkeep of their buildings.
Under the Public Works Act, as the report
states, that responsibility was primarily
placed upon the Department of Public Works,
and we think it should be returned there.
It is interesting to note in the sunmary
of estimates that the Post Office does not
spend a single dollar for erecting and maintaining new buildings, or for renting office
premises. This service is al furnished by the
Public Works Department, which maintains
a staff for this purpose; and so it seems to us
that there is duplication whenever another
diepartment of the government engages in
this type of work. And where you have duplication you are bound to have increased
expense. In any event, this recommendation
is made in the modest hope of the committee
that the government may ýgive it some consideration.
The last recommendation deals with the
same principle-that some study should be
made by the federal and provincial governments to ascertain whether an overlapping
of services exists, and to take the necessary
steps to remedy this situation wherever possible. Anyone who is even slightly familiar
with the conduct of public business realizes
that the federal government and the provincial governinents have many departments
that are the same. I mention health and
welfare, and agriculture, as examples. The
provincial governments do much of the same
kind of work that is done by the federal
government in the field of agriculture. It
should be possible to evolve some plan
whereby the provincial and federal governments can perform their duties and responsibilities without duplicating their services.
Honourable senators, those are the recommendations made in the report. I do not
know what attention will be given them,
but I maintain that they are worthy of serious
consideration.
The object of the committee in making
these recommendations is to suggest that the
administration of our public business at all
levels of government should be established
on as economic and efficient a basis as possible. The heavy Increases that have taken
place in governinent expenditures over the
last ten or twelve years arise mainly from the
expansion of government services in almost

all directions. It would appear that many
of these could be curtailed without injury
to the public interest, which, after all, is the
paramount interest. When you have government expansion of services-I care not
in what direction they go-you have additional tax burdens placed upon the people.
I think the tax burden carried by our people
has just about reached the limit, if we are
not to halt, stifle and retard the development
of this country.
In conclusion, I think we can accept it
as a fact that we shall have to live under
present world conditions for some considerable period of time. We all fervently hope
that another war may be avoided. Almost
anything would be better than a catastrophe
such as war would bring, which might well
destroy our western civilization. At the
same time we realize that if we are to avoid
war we must be strong and do our part along
with the other western nations who are
banding together to meet this great challenge from Russia. We must not forget that
each one of us has a challenge to meet here
at home-the challenge to think clearly, with
vision unobscured as to what are the real
issues in this conflict. We must realize that
the important thing is not the personal
security that we are reaching out to achieve,
desirable as that may be, but the maintenance in this world of the freedom and liberty
upon which has been built the progress of
human civilization.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is the challenge
which faces each one of us, and I make no
bones about saying so; it is the challenge to
put the supreme issues first and let the paltry
secondary issues fall by the wayside.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
it is a brave man indeed who would rise in
his place in this chamber to make a speech
on this subject after the brilliant oration
which bas just been delivered by the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall not attempt to
make a speech. I agree 100 per cent with
every word our colleague has said, but as
one who has served on this committee down
through the years I should like to add a
further thought.
The important thing is that every Canadian
should read this report. Every magazine
and newspaper editor and reporter, every
teacher, preacher and educator throughout

SENATE

the land should study this report, because it
is in this way that the report can make its
greatest contribution to the people of Canada.
Honourable members, at this time I should
like to pay a special compliment to the
chairman of our committee (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have known the honourable gentleman for a long time. We both
come from the same province, and I have
known him as a citizen, a businessman, a politician, a Cabinet Minister, a member of the
House of Commons and a member of the
Senate. And he runs true to form in every
place you put him. What makes the committee's report so valuable, so very valuable, is
the co-operation that he, and he alone, received not only from civil servants but from
members of the government whom he asked to
assist us by giving us information. Throughout
our inquiry I found no evidence of any
attempt by anyone to prevent civil servants
from telling us exactly the facts in the case
under study. I give the government credit
for that, but I give the main credit to my
honourable friend, because after having
served as a minister of the Crown in Canada
for many years he has left on the civil
service the impression that he is a gentleman and can be trusted. That was a feeling
I had throughout our inquiry. Whenever any
civil servant was asked to give evidence
before our committee he felt safe, realizing
that the chairman would not allow a witness
to be put in a false position because of anything he might say to us.
Secondly, I wish to pay tribute not only to
the main committee itself, which performed a
good service, but to my fellow members of the
steering committee. One danger, as I see it, is
that members of the public who read the
committee's proceedings and report might
have the idea that our questions and suggestions reflected some political leaning or bias.
To show how unfounded this idea is, I am
going to outline how the steering committee
worked. It is not necessary for me to name
its members. We had a large number of
meetings, five members being present, and at
each one there was a frank discussion of the
subjects being considered.
First we met to decide what we should try
to do. Opinions were expressed by everybody,
and finally we came to unanimous agreement
on the ideas that we would try to get over in
our report. From time to time we met to
decide whether we should call this witness or
that, whether we should follow up the evidence along some certain line; and sometimes,
honourable senators, it took a couple of hours
to get those five hard-headed people to agree
on these points. But in the end we always

did agree. When we came to the work of
drafting a report, each of us brought to the
meeting his own ideas and suggestions of
what the report should contain, and eventually
we reached a unanimous conclusion on the
whole matter. Some people may think that
that was not a big job. But I assure you,
honourable senators, that it was. We wanted
the report to be an expression to the people
of what the Senate thinks about present conditions, not only in Canada, including its
provinces and municipalities, but in the world
itself. Whether we accomplished that or not
is for the house to say.
When we had brought all our suggestions
together and agreed upon which of them
should be incorporated in the report, we then
asked the chairman to draft a preliminary
report. After this was done, we asked one
of our members, who was formerly a wellknown newspaper man, to give the report
a little newspaper touch. He took it away,
and in two or three days or so brought it
back with certain suggested changes; and then
we redrafted the report. After that we had
another meeting, and for two solid hours we
went over the redrafted report, line by line,
section by section, deleting words here and
adding them there as we thought necessary.
All members of the steering committee were
present, as they had been at all meetings,
except in one or two unavoidable instances;
I know that at least three of us were present
at every meeting. Then after we had finally
agreed upon our final report it was submitted
to the main committee, which, after making
a few changes, unanimously concurred in the
document that is now before the Senate.
To the newspaper editors of Canada, to the
principals of our universities and of our high
schools and public schools, to all people
interested in and concerned with education
in Canada, I say that a reading of the committee's report will give an up-to-date picture of the financial situation in the municipal,
provincial and federal
fields
of this
country. Anyone who wishes to understand
our financial position may do so by reading
the report.
I agree with all that was said by the chairman of the committee, the senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), about the present world situation. I am persuaded-and I
say this because it is awfully close to my
heart-that the Russian leaders believe they
can conquer us by worrying us and causing us
to overburden our industries and economy
until we use up our resources; in short, that
they can out-wait us and defeat us without
having to fire a gun. I say that because of
what they have done in the Far East. Their
policy is to get somebody else to fight their

JUNE 27, 1952
battles for them. They get people in various
countries-even in our country-to accept
their ideas. I am not here to defend a fool
like Endicott, who is just a crazy man that
has gone off the deep end. What puzzles me
is how they get a man to go that way. Their
philosophy appeals to cranks of that type in
all civilized countries. Some men and women
who have formerly lived normal and decent
lives become infected with the Russian
psychology; and the strange thing is that the
worst deceit in Russia seems to make the
strongest appeal to certain people. It seems
to work in reverse ratio. I do not believe that
many of these people would fall for the communist ideal if the Russian leaders ever
acted decently; but they never act decently,
at any time, under any conditions.
In our report we are trying to prepare
Canada to stand up and protect her economy.
It may be that some of the defence expenditures can be criticized-I am not saying they
cannot-but we are not touching on them at
all, for we have not sufficient knowledge
about them to express a definite opinion. We
are whole-heartedly-at least, I am, and I
think the whole committee is-whole-heartedly in favour of the defence expenditures
now being made in Canada. But I do not
believe that as conditions are today Canada
can go on spending for defence and civilian
purposes a total of more than $6 billion a
year. I do not feel that things in general are
a bit better today than they were a year ago.
Honestly, I think that so far as the cold war
with Russia is concerned, the situation is
actually worse than it was last year; and all
indications point to a long struggle. Of course
nobody can hope to positively predict the
outcome of events, for no one knows when
somebody, on either side, may drop a match
in the powder magazine.
I believe the report before us is a good
one, that by it we as senators are making
a real contribution to the economic education
of the Canadian people, and that our policy
of studying the estimates should be continued.
I would refer again to the part that newspaper editors-whether of large city dailies
or rural weekly papers-may play in making
good use of the facts which the report contains. For my part, I would say there is in
the report enough information on which to
base an editorial every week in the year. It
sets out what the federal government is
spending, the costs of administration in the
provincial fields, and how year by year each
bas gone up. It was pointed out to each
witness who appeared before the committee
that Canada's gross national product was
about $18 billion, and that of that amount

$6 billion was the maximum we should use
for public expenditure. Now we find that the
expenditures of our school boards, our municipalities and our provincial governments
have doubled, and in some cases trebled, in
the last ten or fifteen years. Such increases
cannot continue, if we are to meet our international obligations.
Before concluding I wish to again congratulate the Senate in having as chairman
of this committee the honourable member
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who has
given such signal service in this respect.
Indeed, I think that the reports of this committee which he bas placed before parliament over the past three years may be
regarded as his greatest contribution during
his entire public career.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Hayes Doone: Honourable senators, I concur whole-heartedly in the opening
remarks of the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) with respect to the outstanding eloquence of the chairman of the Committee
on Finance and the splendid, constructive
work of which he was the inspiration and
the directing force. I regret that I was not
a member of the committee, and that when it
was meeting I was engaged in other parliamentary work in consequence of which I
did not have an opportunity to examine the
estimates which were laid before parliament.
I must, therefore, at this stage make such
comments as I regard necessary to place
before this bouse the interests of the people
whom I specifically represent.
I wish to speak about markets, a subject
stressed so prominently by the chairman of
the committee (Hon. Mr. Crerar) in moving
the adoption of the report. In this respect,
honourable senators, I should like to ask if
there is any item in the estimates of either
the Department of Fisheries or the Department of Trade and Commerce for the promotion of trade in respect to Maritime fisheries. And if there is not, why not?
In making my observations on this subject
I have nothing to say by way of criticism
of promotional effort in other fields. If
other sections of Canada are receiving benefits, the situation meets with my approval.
But I do suggest and I do hope that the
fishermen of the Maritime Provinces may
walk hand in hand with their fellow Canadians in the ways of progress and prosperity.
The synthetic trade policy of the past few
years, based as it is on international relations and currency control, bas finally caught
up with the limited trade outlets for Maritime
industry, and, for the time at least, has

SENATE
rendered this happy suggestion impossible.
Cumulative results of restrictive regulations
are far from Maritime expectations.
As
members of the great Canadian family, our
expectations were very different from the
realization.
For years, when complaints of isolation and
geographical handicaps were registered, we
were told that our economic survival rested
in our use of the seas, that water-borne
traffic was the answer to our hopes of prosperity and commercial advancement. As
early as 1912 a treaty having this in view
was negotiated with the British West Indies.
In the preamble to the joint enabling legislation which followed there was a statement
to the effect that the purpose of the treaty
was to promote mutual trade relations and
improve communications between the parties
to the agreement. The Act was modified
or extended from time to time and proved
of material service, but it has been rendered
abortive by recent currency restrictions and
the direction of trade through unnatural
channels.
The West Indies, Jamaica, Trinidad, British
Guiana and the Barbadoes, where for so
many years the staple food of the citizens
was Canadian flour and fish, have been closed
to the Maritime fisheries. Former world
markets are similarly inaccessible.
New
Zealand, the Fiji Islands and Australia are
not open to competition. Norwegian packers
are presently selling 500,000 cases in
Australia, a market formerly enjoyed in
large measure by Canadian shippers. In
the Melbourne Herald of May .17, 1952,
the following news item appears-I quote:
London, Fri. Britain has concluded a £1 million
food deal with Russia the Food Ministry announced
today. Britain will supply Russia with canned
herrings worth £800,000. Russia will supply Britain
with canned salmon worth about £800,000 and about
£150,000 worth of crabmeat.

Apparently negotiated trade is possible, but
it does not trickle through to Maritime industry. South Africa, which offered a sound
and steady market, admits a dribble of
its former purchases under an import licence
system. Buyers there who are anxious to
purchase Canadian fish must sacrifice a large
portion of their exchange to secure stocks.
This is a market which after the Imperial
Conference of 1932 advanced from 11,000
to 120,000 cases by the year 1940. I believe
its later development was well sustained, but
that is beyond my personal knowledge. That
the situation will offer no improvement
during the current season arises from advices
that available exchange has been reduced
this year by £70 million.
East Africa, including Tanganyika, Kenya
Colony and Zanzibar, has been closed to
Canadian products. Northern and Southern

Rhodesia, British West Africa and the Northwest African coast are total blackouts. Hong
Kong maintains connections with a few cases.

In the Malay Peninsula and the Straits
Settlements, which in the past were large
purchasers; in Java, a very fair market; in
Sumatra, North Borneo, and the Celebes,
sources of demand are restrained by currency
restrictions.
Mexico, a heavy buyer of former years,
has curtailed importations. In Mexico, more-

over, certain restrictions of a nuisance character are impediments to free shipment.
The name of the shipper and the name of
the agent must be registered. On registration a number is given which must appear
on the label. In normal business it is necessary to buy in quantity lots. If changes are
made in the registration number, a condition
which frequently occurs, labels, become
obsolete and must be destroyed.
This and
similar conditions are matters which can only
be corrected at government level.
In the Dominican Republic sales are pos-

sible, but with an ad valorem duty of 60 per
cent tins must be sold at a price constituting

a sales resistance. It is significant at this
point to note that England buys large quantities of sugar from the Dominican Republic,
paying in dollars, but her purchases from
the West Indies are paid for in sterling.
Cuba extends a preference to the United
States,

rendering

competitive

selling

by

Canadian packers a price-paring process if
sales are to be effected.
The United States market

is practically

closed, as Canadian packers must contend
against a 20 per cent ad valorem duty with
our money now selling at a premium.

Market losses represent several hundred
thousand cases and are a serious blow to
our fisheries. In the meantime the good-will
established through years of experimental
work, through advertising and trade policy
is fast becoming a fading memory.

In addi-

tion, millions of dollars paid out by private
shipping companies, and subsidies paid by
the Dominion Government, are in the category of lost investments.
On the south coast of New Brunswick the
effects are keenly felt. Eastport factories,
usually open by April 15, have not packed
a single case this season. It is evident to
anyone who stops to think that American
inactivity is due to market conditions. Soft
prices at the retail level is the answer. On
the Canadian side of the border, the home
of the sardine, factories are closed in Grand
Manan, Campobello, Deer Island, Back Bay
and Beaver Harbour. Connors Bros. Limited,

JUNE 27, 1952
of Blacks Harbour have large inventories,
and other packers are similarly affected. A
few fish are going to American packers for
cat and dog food and for fertilizer. Otherwise, the Blacks Harbour plant is the only
purchaser. That the picture is not overdrawn is evidenced by the fact that many
small factories which opened and thrived
under wartime conditions have gone to the
wall. Only those fishing plants large enough
to make by-products a paying issue have
survived. The conditions as stated apply
despite desperate efforts on the part of canners to stimulate markets and search out
avenues of sale. Connors Bros. Limited, at
Blacks Harbour, have a $75,000 laboratory,
expert chemists and research workers avidly
seeking new and attractive products. The
American canners last year set aside 25 cents
a case for research for better ways of packing
and marketing.
That these matters are misunderstood is
one of the tragedies of trade. Recently it
was suggested that the depressed state of
the sardine industry arose from the reluctance of canners to pay higher prices to the
primary producers. The statement was no
doubt sincerely, if mistakenly made, but it
was apparently made without a complete
study into effects and causes. This is emphatic proof that to attempt the solution of any
problem we must know in clearly defined
terms what the problem is. To work on
any other basis is a futile and misleading
practice. The surface solution as far as the
primary producer is concerned is higher
prices for fish. With factories closed for
want of markets, the solution is not so simple
or so easy to put into words. Under such
conditions a staple price over a period of
years to the primary producer has not even
the glow worm of a promise. With the
finished product selling, as I have seen it
sell in the South African market, at eight
shillings a case in depreciated currency, the
possibility in past years would be fantastic.
The size factor is another impediment to
standard prices. Practical experience demonstrates that fish range in size to pack out
at anywhere from eleven to thirty cases per
hogshead. The cost per case for the finished
product in such circumstances might triple
in respect to fish content, and at $15 per
hogshead the packing cost might vary from
fifty .cents to $1.50 per case. These figures
are instructive and impressive. Under war
conditions, when a set price of $15 per hogshead was operative,-due entirely to an
effort to check inflation, and in the public
interest,-general satisfaction was displayed.
The only criticism voiced in respect to the

matter was by members of the armed forces,
who considered themselves unfortunate in
being unable to participate in what they
regarded as the lush years of the fishing
industry.
The important point, however and the lesson to be learned, is that the price was
maintained by reason of the fact, and only
by reason of the fact that markets were
available. The failure in today's turn of
events is the failure of markets to stand up
under present conditions. It is not a question of the canners providing a market for
the primary producers. That market cannot be maintained unless a selling market for
canned goods is openly available. The essence
of this comment lies in the fact that canners
are merely distributors of a saleable product
under the competitive incidence of trade.
There is no question about that.
The whole history of the manufacturers
shows a sound policy of live and let live.
Weirmen, boatmen and fishermen have been
financed by manufacturers in the most generous measure. Credit has been widely extended,
and prices have been maintained beyond
expected limits and the immediate needs.
Factory-owned weirs have remained unseined
to give wider distribution in the matter of
purchases. In all transactions of purchase
and accommodation the honour and probity
of the manufacturers has been unquestioned.
They have gained in world markets an enviable reputation for honest dealing and
commercial integrity, and have sustained at
home, both in the trade and among primary
producers, a similar standard of wholesome
approval. The development of today is in no
sense a local one. It is the thrusting back
on the home market of supplies which in
former years found outlets in many foreign
countries.
The situation, therefore, should be the
subject of intensive inquiry, and negotiation
at government level to provide sources of
disposal.
Should anyone question my knowledge of
the points at issue, I may again inform the
Senate that I was born and have lived on
the seashore; that for twenty years I corresponded with and directed shipments of
fish products to almost every known port of
the world; that after intensive and prolonged
study of the intricacies of the fishing industry,
I prepared the New Brunswick brief upon
this subject for presentation to the Imperial
Conference of 1932, and that for the greater
part of a lifetime I have studied the involved
problems presented in every phase of the
industry.
From my experience and from my studies,
I again repeat that receptive markets are the

SENATE
only answers to a recession in sales and to Churchill. I am not as apprehensive as they
the disturbing features presented to both are, however, about the absence of effect of
these reports upon the public mind. I have
packers and primary fish producers.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, if I
may claim the privilege of a few words in
closing the discussion, I should like to
associate myself entirely with what was said
by the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) about the steering committee. The
omission to refer to the steering committee
was a curious lapse on my part, for I had an
item about it in my notes.. The steering committee did very excellent work, and as
chairman I cannot speak too highly of the
co-operation I had from that committee, as I
also did from the general committee. What
the leader of the opposition said about the
careful drafting of the report by the steering
committee is according to fact.
One more point. I am a modest man, honourable senators, and I am a bit overwhelmed by the compliments showered upon
me this afternoon. I think they have been a
little too flattering. Nevertheless I want to
express my thanks to my colleagues for the
kind things they have said about me.
I also wish to associate myself very warmly
indeed with the remarks of the acting leader
of the house (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) as to the
splendid co-operation we had from several
departments of 'the civil service and the
assistance they gave to the committee in its
work.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
COMBINES INVESTIGATION ACT AND
CRIMINAL CODE BILL

COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments ma:de by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 306,
an Act to amend the Combines Investigation
Act and the Criminal Code.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I move that the amendments be concurred in.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I would not be honest with myself if I did
not say something before this report is
carried. I think that some of the sections go
further than is necessary, and are what
might be called hasty legislation.
My business interests are very modest and
are confined to my native province. I have
no connection whatever with "big interests".
I am entirely actuated by what I believe to
be a sense of sound policy for the treatment
and regulation of Canadian business and
industry, and in that connection I am bound
to say that the present bill introduces undesirable features and goes further than is
wholesome or necessary.

I feel that we in Canada owe a lot to our
leaders in business and industry. We can
well be proud of the achievements of these
men, who in co-operation with their staffs
and employees have set a world's record in
the last five years in Canada.
A glance at the income tax and revenue of
this country will show the substantial amount
that industry contributes to the national
treasury. Add to that the amount that comes
out of the pay envelopes and from the earnings of the people who are directly employed
by industry, to say nothing of the people
who are indirectly affected, and it is clear
that the commercial life of this country at
the present time is carrying a tremendous
load and is responsible for a large share of
the revenues of the nation. In addition, we
must remember that there are employed in
Canada today something like 3,725,000 people,
whose welfare and prosperity are all bound
up in industry.
I should like to pay tribute to the character of our Canadian businessmen, and to
emphasize my belief that Canada's prosperity
and welfare are closely linked with a cordial
and happy relationship between government
and the industrial leaders of our nation.
This bill is based on the report of the
MacQuarrie Committee. There was no representative of business or anyone having a
practical knowledge of the business world
on that committee. Moreover, I wonder how
many honourable senators have read the
committee's report.
The bill introduces some new principles of
law which have never before been a part of
the criminal law of this nation for dealing
with any crime whatever. Another new
feature is the provision to investigate situations before any crime has been committed.
While the powers given by the bill can no
doubt be safely left in the hands of our
present Minister of Justice and his deputies,
we must remember that we are passing legislation which will be a part of the laws of this
nation long after we have disappeared, and
it seems to me these powers are capable of
being made use of some day by another government in a very unscrupulous manner.
Monopoly has been described as an undue
lessening of competition.
It is common
knowledge that some so-called monopolies
are in the public interest and stabilize employment. The fixing of prices has become a
national habit, as our farmer friends must
agree, and floor and ceiling prices are established by government.
For this young and vigorous country, with
its wealth of raw materials, we predict a

SENATE

great future; its potential wealth is immeasurable; but it is most important that the
rules and regulations by which these resources
are developed shall be sound and fair to all
concerned, not forgetting the man who risks
his capital.
For these reasons, I think it would have
been the part of wisdom and fairness to delay
some sections of the legislation for further
study next session, until Canadian businessmen, through their associations, had more
time to make their representations, as they
requested.
I felt, honourable members, that I should
place this 'statement on our records.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, as
acting chairman of the committee I should
perhaps say a word. I endorse everything
that my friend from Northumberland (Hon.
Mr. Burchil) has said, with perhaps one
exception. I endorse first his very clear
statement of the great importance of industry in this country, for it is essential to our
very existence. And no one will challenge
what he said about the high character of
the men who lead in industry in Canada.
Also, I am in sympathy with his remarks
about the MacQuarrie Committee. The
members of that committee were of the
highest standing. The Chairman, Mr. Justice
MacQuarrie, was a lawyer of distinction, and
a former attorney general of Nova Scotia,
but I doubt whether the directors of any
well established or newly formed industry
would consider appointing him as its manager. His four associates are distinguished
in economic life; university men of high
standing and a great capacity for clear thinking. But I doubt if any honourable senator
would want to put his money into a company which any one of those gentlemen managed and for whose payroll he was
responsible.
I feel that one should contrast that kind of
commission with one that might have been
established to deal with the affairs of labour
in this country. After all, this commission
was dealing with the most vital things of
industry. I ask honourable senators to picture a commission with the authority and
power that this commission had in respect
of industry, but acting in a similar way with
regard to labour questions, and not a single
labour man on it. I venture to say that if
such a thing had happened there would have
gone up in this country a roar of protest that
could not have been resisted. In freely making
that observation I may say that, as a lifelong
Liberal and, as far as I can now see, one
who expects to remain a Liberal for the

rest of his days, I am usually a little apprehensive when making remarks that may
savour of criticism of the government,
lest one of its opponents may say, "Look at
this old gray-haired Liberal, and listen to
what he says about the Liberal party!" But
I feel no such apprehension in this instance,
honourable senators, because my remarks
apply equally to all parties. I venture to say
that if industry had as many votes as labour
has, the attitude taken on this question would
have been entirely different.
While I do not feel competent to attack the
bill, neither do I feel that I would be prepared to accept it solely on the report of
a commission-particularly when it did not
fully represent all the viewpoints affectedregardless of how long it sat and how carefully it studied the matter before it. Having
gone that far, honourable senators, I would
point out that the House of Commons unanimously endorsed this bill before it was
amended by our committee. The committee
had the choice of either complying with the
suggestion that the bill be flatly rejected for
this session and allowed to go over to the
fall, or of offering amendments to the bill as
it came to us. The general opinion of the
committee was sound, I think, in view of the
fact that for two years or more this subject
has been before the commission or before the
government; and that full opportunity had
been given to members of Parliament of every
party, and to all interested persons, to make
representations. If they did not choose to
avail themselves of the opportunity, that is
their responsibility. But when the measure
was before the other house, the elected representatives of the people supported it unanimously. Our duty, therefore, was to do
exactly what we did.
The Minister of Justice appeared before
the committee and spent some time in a frank
and open discussion; he expressed his views
fully, and answered every question that was
asked of him. We made suggestions by way
of amendment, some of which the Minister
was reluctant to accede to; but in the end
he was in complete agreement with the
amendments that were made. I think we
materially improved the bill, and that we
went as far as the members of an appointed
body should go in dealing with legislation of
this kind.
In my opinion this house should have no
hesitation in adopting the bill as amended.

MARINE AND AVIATION WAR RISKS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 336, an Act respecting Marine
and Aviation War Risks Insurance and Reinsurance Agreements.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
short and simple bill. It permits the Minister
of Finance to make contracts of insurance
or reinsurance for war risks in respect
of aircraft, vessels and cargoes owned by
Canadian citizens. It is what might be called
"stand-by legislation". The regular insurance
companies have felt themselves unable to
insure against war risks; and should there
be any likelihood of an outbreak of war,
and no means of insuring aircraft, vessels and
cargoes, it is quite conceivable that Canadian
aircraft and vessels would have to stay on
land and in port because they would not
be insured in the event of such an outbreak.
Both the United States and Great Britain
have passed legislation similar to that provided by the bill now before us.
Honourable senators will recall that this
house a few days ago passed a bill incorporating the Canadian Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association, an association being
formed by the shipowners of Canada for
the purpose of carrying war insurance on
Canadian vessels and cargoes. It is that
insurance which will be reinsured by the
Minister of Finance under this bill, as and
when the need arises.
I may say that this morning the subject
matter of the bill was explained to' the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, and the proposal contained in the
bill received the unanimous approval of
that committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

CURRENCY, MINT AND EXCHANGE FUND
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill 390, an Act respecting Currency, the Royal Canadian Mint and the
Exchange Fund.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill also
was considered in a preliminary way by the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce this morning, when we had as a witness Dr. Clark, the Deputy Minister of
Finance, who gave us some extremely interesting explanations.
The bill for the most part is merely a
putting together, in a single form and in a
modernized version, of the existing legislation respecting currency, the Royal Canadian
Mint, and the Exchange Fund. It is divided
into four sections, on each of which I will
comment very briefly.
Part I is under the heading "currency and
coinage", and it relates to the monetary unit
of Canada and to subsidiary coins which
may be issued. Section 4 contains a provision which would permit of the reissue by
the Mint of gold coins in this country if and
when the fortunate event should ever arrive
when the par value of our dollar becomes
fixed and the fixed value of that dollar is
maintained. Under the heading of "Subsidiary Coins" there is a new provision which
permits the Governor in Council to substitute
other metals for the metals normally used
in silver and nickel coinage should there be
a shortage of the metals now so used. In
fact, as honourable senators probably know,
owing to the demand for nickel for war purposes, the old nickel five-cent piece has been
replaced by a steel coin of the same face
value; and this amendment would permit
the same sort of thing to be done in the
future. The provisions with respect to legal
tender and the melting of gold coins are in
no way different from those contained in the
present legislation.
Part II of the bill deals with the Royal
Canadian Mint, and contains, I think, nothing
new which need detain the house for any
length of time, except perhaps two provisions.

SENATE
One would permit the Governor in Council
to establish a branch of the Mint elsewhere
than in Ottawa to provide facilities for the
melting and assaying of gold. I understand
that a branch is being established for that
purpose in the city of Vancouver. The other
amendment is to provide that the Master of
the Mint shall make an annual report to
parliament covering the operations of the
Mint.
Part III of the bill carries over from the
Foreign Exchange Control Act, which is
being repealed, the provisions for the
Exchange Fund which is held by the Minister
of Finance to aid in the control and protection
of the external value of the Canadian monetary unit. That fund was started in 1935
with some fifty or sixty million dollars, being
the profit upon the revaluation of gold made
at that time. At present the fund amounts
to about $1,750 million, and we were
informed in the committee this morning that
it consists of approximately $850 million in
gold and about the same amount in United
States currency. This is the only part of the
Foreign Exchange Control Act which is continued in operation.
Part IV deals with the repeal of the various Acts and parts of Acts, including the
Foreign Exchange Control Act, which this
bill seeks to replace; it also repeals three
sections of the Bank of Canada Act under
which the government has had the right to
call in all old gold coins of Canada and to
pay for them at the former rate of $20 per
ounce. As it happens, practically all these
gold coins have been called in, so it is not
felt necessary to continue these provisions.
That is in brief an explanation of this bill.
Hon. A. N. McLean: Honourable senators,
I would like to call the attention of the house
to Part III of this bill, under the heading of
"Exchange Fund". In committee I registered
the objection that I did not think this clause
was broad enough. It will be noted, that the
minister is given power to purchase and
acquire with money in the Exchange Fund
Account the following: gold; currency of the
United States; deposits in currency of the
United States; currencies of any country
other than Canada or the United States that
are freely convertible into gold or United
States dollars; and deposits in such currencies held in the name of the minister with
the Bank of Canada or any other designated
bank; securities of or guaranteed by the
Government of Canada. These are the monetary instruments that the minister is given
authority to purchase.
You will note that United, States dollars,
upon which we recently wrote off an $80

million loss, are given top position, whereas
sterling is not recognized in any way at all.
There was a time, not so long ago, when
sterling was the top money of the world,. I
personally can well remember when sterling
was the prime reserve in all the leading
national banks. Today British sterling is having a desperate fight to come back, and that
sterling shall be restored to its former prestige means, I think, just as much to us in
North America as it does to the United Kingdom and other parts of the commonwealth.
Some may think that sterling may be "down
and out", but I can tell you that there is
just as much of the world's trading carried
on today in British sterling as is carried on in
dollars. Yet, although we are part of the
British Empire, instead of lending a hand to
sterling at this time of crisis, we choose, so
far as this bill goes, to stay on the outside
just looking in.
Today British sterling is convertible into
the moneys of New Zealand, South Africa,
Australia, and many other parts of the
Empire. Now it is true that if we were to
recognize sterling and place some millions in
reserve in the Bank of Canada, and thereby
lessen the strain on the pound, such sterling
would not be convertible in the United States
and several other dollar countries. On the
other hand, it would give this country present
or future purchasing power in Australia,
South Africa, New Zealand and other parts
of the sterling area.
It is true that these countries are going
through a crisis at the present time, but their
resources are beyond imagination and they
have a future like ourselves. These countries
are going to become great nations. All wealth
comes from what is taken from the land and
sea, and these countries have vast areas to
develop with the brawn and the brain of their
people. Their resources are enormous, and
in five or ten years we shall look back and
wonder why they ever had to go through
such a monetary crisis as they are now. I
cannot see that we are taking any risk by
investing money in the future purchasing
power of these countries. In our country
there are surpluses of pork, beef, lumber,
fish, and so forth, on which we are bound to
take a loss in the future. If sterling was
recognized by the Bank of Canada and we
accepted it for these surplus goods the risk
on the sterling would not be nearly so
great as the risk of holding our surpluses
and selling them at a loss.
Honourable senators, before I sit down I
should like to call attention to the Russian
situation.
Russia is mining an enormous
amount of gold, and is not selling it. The
Russians are putting the gold behind the

JUNE 27, 1952
ruble with the idea, I am sure, of establishing
the ruble at the top currency of all their
satellite states, and Moscow is the final depository for the reserves of these satellite states.
There is no doubt at all that the Soviet has
studied the history of the British pound
over the past century. The Russians are
good imitators, and they are endeavouring
to raise the prestige of the ruble so as to
make it a strong trading unit throughout
their sphere of influence-which, of course,
is their privilege-just as the British did with
with the pound sterling centuries ago. Barter
deals with dictator states simply strengthen
the ruble because the Russians do not take
anything from the free world except what
they need. They have little desire to confer
mutual benefits on the other nations as far
as trade itself goes.
One may find Russian salmon on sale in
the stores of Great Britain. The same is
true of Australia and other parts of the
Empire. This is simply because Russia recognizes the pound sterling and trades in it.
We have an enormous surplus of salmon on
our Pacific Coast, so why should any part
of the British Empire have to buy salmon
from a dictator state? This kind of trading
is simply building up states behind the Iron
Curtain and making the Russian ruble
stronger. The free world, of course, needs
a dollar of high prestige, but it also needs a
strong pound sterling. We in Canada should
seize every opportunity to strengthen the
British sterling, and if we pass up reasonable
opportunities to support the pound we are
going to regret it in days to come.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I do not intend to detain the house,
but I do think a word of comment should be
offered in reply to the observations made by
my worthy friend the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean).
First of all, there is no disposition that I
knûow of on the part of any official of the
Bank of Canada, the Department of Finance
or the Department of Trade and Commerce
to discourage trade with Great Britain under
present conditions. Furthermore, I do not
believe there is any dearth of the pound sterling in this country should anyone wish to
use it. The great difficulty is that Britain
herself has been forced by circumstances to
reduce to a minimum all imports from countries in the dollar area. This is a decision for
Britain alone to make, and I do not think
there is anything Canada can do, beyond the
innumerable conferences held at London and
elsewhere, to try to bring about a closer
55708-38

approximation between the dollar and the
pound sterling in relation to trade.
On Wednesday I listened with a great deal
of interest to a speech delivered to the
Canadian Club of Ottawa by the Right Honourable Mr. Menzies, Prime Minister of
Australia. Speaking not as an economist but
as a common-sense statesman, he made it
quite clear that all this trouble about the
relationship of the pound sterling to the dollar
is secondary to the question of trade. He said
he wished to see a conference called between
the members of the British Commonwealth of
Nations. In this connection he did not suggest some imaginative solution to bring the
units of currency closer together, but he
stressed the need for normal trade of goods
between one country and another.
The situation which has developed between
the United Kingdom, Canada and the United
States in connection with the financial and
industrial position of Great Britain is directly
traceable to the unfortunate and tragic consequences of the war. The United Kingdom,
along with countries from the dollar area was
a signatory of the United Nations Charter,
which provided for multilateral trade through
the treaties of the International Trade Organization. These treaties were attested to by the
British just as they were by ourselves. But
when the Labour government came into power
in Britain it immediately adopted a policy of
completely isolating itself from contact with
the other signatories to the great idea of the
International Trade Organization. At the same
time Britain adopted a policy in connection
with the so-called sterling block-which incidentally represented far more of the world's
population than the dollar area-but she did
not have the means to start re-establishing
her economies in a natural and normal way.
Consequently she has been faced with the
stupdendous task of working her way out of
her unfortunate situation by applying her
labour and scientific capacities in the same
way that Germany did following World War
I. It is true that Germany repudiated her
indebtedness and then went to work and
reestablished her trade with the world. It
seems to me that unless something happens
in Britain to bring about a larger production
of goods and a greater measure of trade with
other countries, the pound sterling will not
become any more valuable than it is now, and
may become worth a lot less.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I cannot but feel that
my honourable friend, from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean), with his intimate knowledge of the currency problem and

SENATE
the international gold situation, is overstressing the importance of currency and exchange
in relation to the realities of trade.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators, I
must sayThe Hon. the Speaker: I would remind the
honourable gentleman that he has .already
spoken in this debate and may not participate
in it again.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I wish to ask a question
of my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert).
The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable
gentleman merely wishes to ask a question,
he of course may do so.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I should like to ask my
honourable friend if world trade does not
consist of transactions that are made up of
commodities, on the one hand, and a stable
currency, if you can get it, on the other
hand. And I should like to read to him the
recordThe Hon. the Speaker: I am afraid that this
is not a question.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I shall try to answer the
question, so far as it went. The answer, stated
gener.ally, is that goods really have to be paid
for with goods, and that currencies do not
matter. Naturally there is a ratio established
between goods and currencies, but goods must
be paid for with goods.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
while I was listening to the interesting
remarks of the senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) and the reply
of the senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) the thought occurred to me that, after
all, money is only a medium of exchange. It
is not wealth, but a demand on wealth. The
sterling countries can only solve their
exchange and financial problems by producing more goods and selling them in the markets to which they are indebted. That is
understood in Britain, for she is making a
strong effort to close the gap between her
imports and exports, and, appears to be succeeding quite well.
Many people think that in a country whose
currency is depreciated you can buy goods
and services cheaper than in a country with
a firm currency. However, while travelling
in Europe recently I found that prices over
there are as high as in Canada, and for some
goods even higher, in terms of our own
currency.
In dealing with the question of storing
American dollars as reserves, we have to
remember that the American dollar is a free
currency on all the markets of the world,

whereas the British pound is a restricted
currency.
If you go to England as a
visitor you can take in only £10 and take out
not more than £5. It would hardly be
advantageous from the point of view of
trade to store up a restricted currency of
that kind.
Just at present our currency is worth more
than the American currency, but American
currency is better known and more widely
used abroad. Many Canadians feel that the
premium which our dollar enjoys over the
American dollar today is the result of a
temporary condition brought about by large
expenditures of American capital in Canada,
and that under normal conditions our dollar
will certainly not rank above the American.
I do not think there is much risk in having
reserves of American dollars.
As stated by the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), the whole test of a country's
financial position is determined by its balance
of trade and services. Until the European
countries can sell us sufficient goods to pay
for what they need so badly, we shall have
a balance of trade against them. I think
their position is being improved because
of the large expenditures that the United
States and Canada are making in Europe
for arms and other defence purposes.
Indeed, my observation was that there is
already a good deal of general prosperity in
western Europe. I found that the hotels,
restaurants, and places of entertainment were
crowded, and the trains and buses seemed
to be as well patronized as they are in
our country. Agriculture is prospering there.
In fact, the whole of western Europe looked
almost like a well-kept garden. I am told
that the situation in West Germany is
especially buoyant, that the level of prosperity there is far above what the people
have known for many years. Conditions in
Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are
good, and in France the trouble seems to be
political rather than economic.
Britain
appears to be carrying the heaviest burden.
She is in need of many primary products
from abroad, her outlays in the two world
wars were tremendous, and her reserves have
been depleted, partly as a result of the
non-payment to her of moneys that she lent
to other countries. Her means of restoration
are a greatly enlarged export trade, which
is quite competitive, and austerity at home.
When she has achieved these things the
value of her sterling will rise to its former
level.
The high place that the American dollar
holds on international markets today is not
the cause but the result of what has been
happening in the world; and the countries
which now have a depreciated currency will

JUNE 27, 1952

not improve their condition until they produce and sell more and thereby restore a
normal balance of trade. In the meantime,
Canada has reserves of gold and American
dollars.
Hon. J. J. Hayes Doone: Honourable senators, as I understand it, the point which
was made by the senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) was that
although the British Commonwealth produces
all the commodities necessary to maintain
prosperous trade relations among its member
countries, it has not a common currency as
a medium of exchange. In the United States
the situation is different. The forty-eight
separate states can exchange their wide
variety of products freely among themselves,
for they have a common currency. Now, in
Russia, which often comes under discussion
in this house, there is a conglomeration of
states. But they can deal among themselves,
by reason of the fact that they have a currency which can be utilized by them for the
purchase and sale of their products.
The British Empire has practically everything it needs in a material way, with the
exception of cotton and petroleum. When the
Empire lost Egypt, it lost cotton; but if
Alberta comes through with petroleum, we
will have practically all the elements of commerce necessary to world trade. We have
wheat, coarse grains, livestock, dairy products, precious metals, base metals, vegetable
oils, wool, chemicals, beverages, coal, sugar,
rice, rubber, fish, fruit, furs and lumber.
The list includes practically everything that
man desires for use in a commercial way.
The difficulty is, however, that the Empire
has no common currency. It was, I believe,
the suggestion of the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean)
that sterling should be supported in this
country and throughout the British Empire.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have been much interested in the discussion
which bas taken place on this bill; and I
think I would be disposed to agree with m'ost
of the things that honourable senators have
had to say. I should like, however, to direct
the attention of the bouse to the fact that
the discussion bas gone outside the terms
of the bill which we are considering.
The bill before us is a measure respecting
currency, the Royal Mint and the Exchange
Fund. The discussion which bas taken place
arises out of Part III of the bill, relating to
the Exchange Fund which is kept by the
Minister of Finance. Both of my honourable
friends from the province of New Brunswick
(Hon. Mr. McLean and Hon. Mr. Doone) have
suggested that the fund which, as I explained,

consists partly of gold and partly of United
States currency, should be enlarged to include
amounts of British currency, with the hope
of helping to support the British pound.
Hon. Mr. Doone: May I make just one
observation?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Doone: I made my observations
in view of the fact that the legislation is
permissive, and not mandatory.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am trying to point out
that the Exchange Fund referred to in the
bill is not designed for the purpose suggested
by my honourable friends. The sole purpose
of the fund, as the bill provides, is to aid in
the control and protection of the external
value of the Canadian monetary unit; and if
we wish to protect the Canadian dollar, we
have got to have the resources to protect
that unit in the kind of money into which it
can be exchanged. The only kinds of money
into whichy it can be readily exchanged at par
today are the United States dollar or gold.
My honourable friends said a number of
things with which I have great sympathy. I
agree that it would be advisable for us to
do what we can to help support the British
pound. We have I think, already done a
good deal in that connection by way of
grants; but that is a matter for discussion
under the heading of trade policy rather than
under this particular bill. I simply point
out to my friends that wise as their observations may be, and however sound may be
their suggestions as to policy, they do not
arise under the bill we are now discussing.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: With leave of the Senate, now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

CANADIAN SHIPS AND SEAMEN
INQUIRY
Hon. Mr. Duff inquired of the government:
1. How many ocean going dry cargo merchant
vessels (a) of 4,700 deàd weight tons or thereabouts,
and (b) 10,000 or over dead weight ton capacity
owned in Canada, under Canadian registry are (a)
not commanded by Canadian masters and their
officers; (b) employed by all or part with non
Canadian crews?
2. How many such vessels owned previously in
Canada by Crown corporations or otherwise are
registered in other countries and do not employ
Canadian masters, mates and crews?
3. What was the cost of said ships and their
present value?
4. Are there any industries besides shipping,
owned in Canada and built up by Canadian taxpayers that are authorized to employ non Canadians;
thereby preventing the employment of Canadians
at Canadian rates of pay?
5. Is the government aware that members of
qualified Canadian masters and other officers who
live .passed the vexy strict examinatioris prepared
hk the Marine 'Division of the Department of Transport ,are forced to serve in positions below those
they are qualified for, and some are forced to serve
as seamen due t. sikorage of ships etc?
6. How many times, and what dates, have Canadian coatal lvaws betn jsuspended -or changed- to
permit the operation of foreign fiags orforeigr) built
ships or Canadian owned ships to be registered outgfdeâf Caifada n'i
~rEifâmn ari~fôiilrijdf
7. Are British (not Canadian) and/or German
crews still employed on the S.S. Lumberman, S.S.
Royal William, S.S. Le Grande, S.S. Hermane, S.S.
Lapetite, S.S. World Trotter and S.S. Malo, and on
what other ships owned by the Canadian government either through one or more Crown corporations or otherwise?
8. Did the so-called Maritime Commission in 1950
or thereabouts agree to the transfer of 123 Canadian registered vessels from Canada to British
registry? If not, how many?
9. If said ships were still registered in Canada and
employing Canadian crews what amount approximately would be spent in Canadian industry and
homes?
10. If so, approximately how much income tax
would be received from Canadian officers and sesmen and paid into the Canadian treasury each year?

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The answers to the
questions asked by the honourable senator
are as follows:
1. According to latest information:
(a) Nil;
(b) Five 10,000 ton ships have other than
Canadian masters, officers and crews. Of
these five, three were originally loaned to
the United Kingdom under "mutual aid", subsequently chartered to the United Kingdom
and delivered in the United Kingdom to
55708-39

Canadian purchasers in 1948. They have
consequently never carried Canadian crews
since they were built and have never operated
into Canadian ports. The other two ships
have operated away from Canadian waters
since 1948. One of them is on bare-boat
charter to Italian interests.
2. 4,700 tons deadweight-30 sold to foreign
interests.
10,000 tons deadweight-92 on
United Kingdom registry under transfer plan,
68 sold to foreign interests.
3. The average cost of a 10,000 ton vessel
was $1,700,000 and of a 4,700 ton vessel
$1,200,000. The present value is difficult to
assess but 10,000 ton vessels have recently
been sold for close to $1,000,000 and 4,700
ton vessels for prices ranging from $540,000
to $760,000.
4. The department has no information with
respect to the employment of non-Canadians
by industries not coming within its
jurisdiction.
5. It has been customary for seamen holding higher certificates t6 serve - at sea in
lower positions awaiting promotion when
vacancies occur in higier positions for which
proper- certificates of competency may be
hèld. Einployment of certificated and other
séamen ';ithin the provisions of the Canadâ
Shipping Act is chiefly a matter for negótiatin between a shipownëi. as employer and
a seamàn as employee. To facilitate ômployment discretion bas been exercised under
Sectih 193A of the- Canada Shipping èAti
-19f94, -as- amendci -1948to-enable-seamen,
with inferior qualifications to be employed
for a limited period of time in positions
requiring higher certificates of competency
or until such time as seamen holding proper
certificates can be found.
6. The coastal laws have undergone no
change nor have they been suspended since
the Canada Shipping Act was passed in 1934.
The transfer of registry of Canadian owned
ships to Britain and foreign lands is not
governed by Part XIII of the Canada Shipping Act which deals with the coasting trade
of Canada.
Section 665 of the act gives the Governor
in Council power to declare that the provisions of Part XIII shall not apply to specified vessels for specified period of time.
Between January 1, 1949, and December 31,
1951, section 665 has been applied for varying
periods to 44 various craft, including ships,
barges, and scows. In all cases the customs
duty called for by the Act has been paid.
7. The Canadian Government owns no
ocean going ships through Crown companies
or otherwise.
•

SENATE
S.S. Lumberman, S.S. La Petite Hermine,
S.S. La Grande Hermine and S.S. St. Malo
have been sold to foreign interests. The other
two ships are included in the answer to Question 1, and operate continuously away from
Canadian waters.
8. As a result 36 Canadian owned ships
were transferred to United Kingdom registry
and 58 were permitted to remain on United
Kingdom registry as they had been since they
were first built. Had this arrangement not
been made all these ships would in all probability have had to be laid up owing to the
low freight market prevailing at the time.
As it was, the transfer plan was extremely
helpful to the shipping industry.
9. No information is available on this
matter.
10. No information is available on this
matter.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
with respect to the business before the
House, I am afraid that at the moment I
am not in a position to add very much to
what I said just prior to the adjournment
yesterday afternoon. I am advised that there
is still a possibility-though, I must say,
rather a faint one-of the session being adjourned tonight; and under these circumstances I am going to ask the Senate to
adjourn until three o'clock this afternoon.

By that hour we may hope to know definitely whether we can expect to complete our
business this evening. If it cannot be concluded by then I will suggest to the Senate
that it adjourn until Monday evening at
eight o'clock; this will at least enable honourable senators to have a reasonable week-end.
I therefore move that the Senate adjourn
during pleasure until three o'clock this afternoon.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
since we met this morning the situation has
crystallized, and I am sorry to have to report
to the house that there has been a new and,
I fear, severe attack of loquacity in the
other chamber which makes it quite impossible to anticipate prorogation by this evening.
I would therefore move that the
Senate do now adjourn until 8 o'clock on
Monday evening.
May I impress upon honourable senators
that all who can possibly attend on Monday
evening should be here in order that we shail
have a quorum to take up any business which
may come before us at that time.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTSCONSENT OF PROVINCES
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators, I am rising on a question of privilege,
and one that is rather curious in the sense
that it is being made at the request of the
Prime Minister. On Saturday last I received
a letter from the Prime Minister, part of
which was written in French and part
in English. For the convenience of honourable senators I have had the French part of
the letter translated.
The letter commences:
My dear Senator:
My attention has just been called to the fact that
the other day in the Senate you, no doubt unwittingly, were guilty of unfairness towards me. You
said that the fact that our Constitution was being
amended under the power conferred by the amendment to the Constitution enacted in 1949 constituted
the violation of a promise made by me to the
provincial premiers during the Federal-provincial
Conference of January, 1950.
This is not in accord with the facts.

Now, what did I say on that occasion? I
have in my hand a copy of Hansard of June
17, 1952. I quoted there a statement made
by my friend the senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), for whom, as you know, I
have the greatest respect. The statement
that I quoted was as follows:
It was strongly represented at that time that the
provinces should have been consulted before such
action was taken, and this representation was made
so forcibly that the Prime Minister gave definite
undertakings that the application of the B.N.A. Act
(1949) No. 2 would be held in abeyance pending
the production by the provinces of a better method
of amending the constitution. If honourable senators are interested in reading the statements, I
would refer them to pages 46, 49 and 69 of the
report of the proceedings of the conference between
the provinces and the dominion of January last.

This statement was, as I say, made by the
senator from Ottawa; it was not my statement.
I did not change one word or comma of it;
I quoted it just as it was put by my honourable friend. He is an experienced public man,
a shrewd newspaperman, who has been
present at dominion-provincial conferences,
and so on, and I took his statement to be
correct. Indeed, as I said on June 17, I even
went to the trouble of corroborating the
facts. That statement was made by my
honourable friend on the 21st of February,

1951, and for fifteen months it stood
unassailed, uncontradicted, and was taken to
be right. And in the session of 1951, when
we were discussing an amendment to the
British North America Act, just two weeks
after my honourable friend had made his
statement, I commented upon it.
And now in his letter to me the Prime
Minister states there were qualifications to
the promise that he made. Because the
letter is long, I will not read the whole of it,
but I ask permission of the house to place on
Hansard the remainder of the letter, continuing from where I left off.
The remainder of the letter is as follows:
The premiers had said that they regretted that we
had caused this amendment of 1949 to be adopted
before the conference, and I said that if it might
be helpful towards securing an agreement on a
general procedure for all future amendments we
would not object to having this procedure apply to
what was comprised in the 1949 amendment.
As our discussion was carried on in English,
I prefer to give you the precise citations in that
language. You will find at page 46 of the report
of the conference in English, the following:
"Some concern bas been expressed as to whether
the language used in the 1949 No. 2 Act could not
be subject to interpretations which might extend
it to things that would not be purely federal; and
that if we are going to examine our whole problem
it should be examined in such a way as to dispose
of that concern.
I do not raise any objection to that. If we are
examining the whole field I do not think we would
wish to say, 'Well, now, there bas been something
enacted which is an obstacle to doing now what
would contribute to the creation of a feeling of
confidence on the part of the Canadian people that
we all mean to do the right thing by each other'."
The next day Mr. Frost stated (page 50):
"I may say that yesterday my colleagues and I
were very much interested in certain proposals
which were advanced by other governments. I felt
that the Prime Minister himself contributed immeasurably to the solution of the problem with
which we are faced in the statement that be made
yesterday relevant to the Act of 1949, and his
willingness and the willingness of his government
that the subject matter of that Act should be considered here and that it should be subject to the
machinery, if I may put it that way, which will
come out of the conference."
Other premiers had also alluded to the same
matter, among others, Mr. Duplessis, who had asked
for more precise clarification. This is what you
will find in the report as being what Mr. Duplessis
said (page 54):
'Mr. Prime Minister, before the meeting adjourned last evening I understood that this morning you were to tell us exactly the stand of the
federal authorities in connection with the recent
constitutional amendment of 1949, No. 2. I may
have been under a wrong impression; but I think it
would be important to know exactly the stand of
the government in that regard. Yesterday afternoon, if I understood you correctly, you stated that
the federal authorities would be willing to consider
examining the whole constitution, including the
new amendment."

I then answered (pages 54 and 55), as follows:
"I will not say any decision was arrived at; but
I understand the suggestion offered by Mr. Macdonald, for instance, would cover the whole field
and would render subsection (1) of 91, enacted by

JULY 1, 1952
the 1949 statute, inoperative. What I stated was
that we had no objection to the discussion of an
over-all procedure being over-all; but what I said
this morning was intended to mean that we were
not suggesting that we would be prepared, if
nothing else was agreed upon, to ask for the repeal
of the 1949 statute.
It would disappear in an
over-all procedure; but it was not intended to be
an undertaking to cause it to disappear if there
were to be no over-all procedure.
Mr. Frost: Our suggestion was for an over-all
procedure."
And I replied:
"That was my understanding; that it was the
désire to discuss the possibility of an over-all procedure which would absorb this particular subsection of section 91."
Now, as a matter of fact, no agreement was
arrived at about a procedure which would apply to
the whole matter and there was no violation of any
promise in relying upon the amendment of 1949, nor
will there be any violation of any promise in relying upon it in the future so long as na other procedure extending to the whole matter shall have
been accepted by everybody and substituted for
this amendment of 1949.

that, he and I have been friends all our
lives, and for that reason I am most anxious
to make the record clear.
The Prime Minister has not violated any
pledge or failed in any promise. Now that
we have his statement of the facts, we are
free to do this work in the only way it
is possible to do it. I hope that the honourable gentleman will accept my answer in
the friendly manner in which I give it. I have
every respect for him, and I am sure that hé
will understand the position that I have
taken. There is no doubt that he has a right
to do as he has done, or that he has acted
in his usual responsible way.
As the Prime Minister wrote to me in
French, I desire to conclude my remarks with
a few words in that language-A bon entendeur, salut. Honi soit qui mal y pense.

SENATE
Apart altogether from the irrelevance of
the reference he made to my remarks, my
honourable friend entirely ignored the qualifying words which I used, namely, ".. . pend-

ing the production by the provinces of a
better method of amending the constitution."
If those qualifying words mean anything,
they mean pending a better method of amending the constitution than that defined in the
British North America Act (1949) No. 2, which
was the subject of the conference between
the dominion and the provinces in 1950.
The answer I would give to my honourable
friend is that two years have passed since
the Prime Minister made his statement before
the Dominion-Provincial conference, and
during that time the provinces have made
not a single gesture toward a better method
of procedure for dealing with the six classes
of subjects in the British North America
Act which were tabulated for consideration.
I submit most emphatically that at no time
in my remarks during the debate on Senate
reform-or "The Senate and its work", as
it was called-did I suggest that the British
North America Act (1949) No. 2 should be
superseded or withdrawn. The Prime Minister made quite clear to the conference that
he did not intend doing any such thing; and
in support of that position I would point to
the quotation made by my honourable friend
from page 55 of the proceedings of the
conference. That information will appear on
Hansard, as my friend has been good enough
to file the letter which he received recently
from the Prime Minister, and to which he
has referred.
The Prime Minister wanted to give the
provinces ample time to work out an over-all
procedure by which we could amend our own
constitution, and for that reason he would
not press independent federal action on certain classes of questions; but he never suggested at any time that he would weaken in
his purpose to have the British North America
Act amended in Canada rather than in the
Imperial Parliament in Great Britain.
I heartily support the Prime Minister in
that position, and I think it is rather unfortunate that the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) should have
raised this whole question on redistribution
in the way he did when the fires of an election campaign in a nearby province are
burning rather intensely. Whether he did
so unwittingly, I do not know, but I should
have thought that he was above such things
after having served so faithfully in this
chamber for over twenty years. I am willing
to think that what he did was 'accidental,
but I am quite sure he will grant me the
right to take exception or to deprecate the

possibility of having innocent and irrelevant
statements of mine used as cannon-fodder by
young antagonists who at this time are making political war with each other on the
other side of the Ottawa River.

ST. LAWRENCE WATERWAYS
DOCUMENTS TABLED

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I desire to make a statement on the
St. Lawrence Waterways project similar to
one that was made by the Prime Minister
in the other place this afternoon, and to
table, for the information of the Senate,
copies of the application of the Government of Canada to the International Joint
Commission for an order of approval of the
construction of certain works for development of power in the International Rapids
section of the St. Lawrence River, which the
Prime Minister signed for the Secretary of
State for External Affairs and forwarded
to the commission yesterday.
ýI should also like to table copies of notes
which, at a meeting that took place in Washington yesterday, were exchanged between
the Minister of Transport (Hon. Mr. Chevrier),
the Acting Secretary of State of the United
States, Mr. Bruce, and the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Hume Wrong.
The United States Government has also sent
to the International Joint Commission an
application which was signed by the Acting Secretary of State in Mr. Chevrier's presence yesterday.
I am sure I am expressing the sentiments
of the Senate when I say that we commend
the Minister of Transport and the officials
who have been dealing with this matter
for the diligence they have shown in advancing this great project.
These applications request the International Joint Commission to approve the construction, by entities to be designated by the
two federal governments, of works for the
development of power in the international
rapids section of the St. Lawrence River.
The works for which approval is requested
are set out in Section 8 of the application,
and are described in the agreement with the
Province of Ontario dated December 3, 1951,
which forms the schedule to the International Rapids Development Act passed at the
last session of parliament.
As the question of the deep waterway is
not being referred to the International Joint
Commission in the applications which Ihave
just mentioned, and as the governments of
both Canada and the United States have for

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I am afraid that there is nothing much that
I can add to the statement I made when I
reported to the Senate last evening. There
is no legislation before us that we have not
dealt with, and we are still awaiting the
Appropriation Bill and the Redistribution
Bill, which are to come to us from the
other house. It appears that that house has
not yet made much progress with the Redistribution Bill. In these circumstances the
only suggestion that I can make to honourable senators is that the Senate should
adjourn until tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock,
and I propose to move to that effect.
To honourable senators who have remained
here under rather trying conditions for the
purpose of forming a quorum, I want to
express my sincere thanks.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps I should add
my thanks to the honourable gentleman from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) for returning
here after the considerable absence which
he has enjoyed.

Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

I move that when the Senate adjourns it

Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: If the situation is
the same tomorrow night, would it be possible
for this house to adjourn until, say, Thursday

who wish to do so may return to their

nothing? Should the members of the other
house finish their business in the meanwhile,
perhaps it would not be out of order for them
to wait on us for a change.

REPRESENTATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 393, an Act to readjust
the Representation in the House of Commons.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: With leave of the
Senate, I move the second reading now.
This bill, honourable senators, was finally
passed by the House of Commons at one
o'clock today, ýand under the circumstances it
bas been impossible this evening to distribute
it in its final form to members of this bouse.
I an advised however that on the Table there
are sufficient copies available for any honourable senators who wish to examine the
bill, and that these copies are in the form
in which the bill was passed in the other
place, including the changes which were
effected in the course of its passage through
that house, and the correction of a few minor
typographical errors.
This bill, concerning as it does representation in the House of Commons, isý perhaps
more of a subject for debate in that house
than in this chamber; and indeed, as honourable senators are aware, it has been
debated very continuously in that house for
the last four or fie. days... OCcourse from a
technical point of view this chamber is at
liberty to suggest such changes in the bill
as it may see fit. I might say, however,
that the bill, as it is before us carries· out the
provisions of section 51 of the British North
America Act as that Act was amended earlier
in the session. That section requires the
Parliament of Canada, after each decennial
census, to readjust the representation of members in the House- of Commons in accordance
with the population, and it 'lays down the
rules by which that readjustment is to be
accomplished.
The census figures, taken for: the year 1951
have made it necessary that some provinces
shal lose seats and other provinces shall
gain seats. Thus, ,by the bill now before
55708-40

us, Nova Scotia loses one seat, Quebec
gains two, Ontario gains two, Manitoba loses
two, and British Columbia gains four. The
representation of the other provinces, except
Saskatchewan, remains unchanged. Under
normal conditions Saskatchewan would lose
five seats; but as honourable senators will
recal, the amendment of the British North
America Act which received the approval of
this house some fortnight ago provided that
in any decennial redistribution no province
shall lose more than 15 per cent of its
representation for the previous ten years.
Hon. Mr. King: That is an amendment of
the present Act?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It was an amendment
of the British North America Act which was
put through parliament about a fortnight ago.
If the census figures were strictly adhered
to, the province of Saskatchewan would lose
one-quarter of its representation-five seats
-but under this amendment it will lose
only three seats. In other words, its representation will be reduced from twenty to
seventeen.
The amendment to . the British North
America Act to which I referred also provides that the Yukon and the Northwest
Territories, which - up to now have been
represented by one member, -shal be represented separately. Provision is made, therefore, for an additional seat in the House of
Commons. Under the bill now before us that
house will havç 265 seats hereafter as compared with 262 at the present time.
The sehedule to the bill sets out in detail
thé names of the various constituencies in the
different provinces, and their geographical
boundaries.
I would hope,. honourable senators, that
this -measure will pass through this house
more or less as a matter of form, in the traditiônal way in which in the past we have dealt
with. ineasures of this kind coming to us from
the House off Coxmmons.
Sone Hon. Senators:lHear, hear.
Hon. 'I. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
have only a few remarks to make on this
occasion. The house .Wil recall that some

SENATE
pleased that the government saw fit to propose a reduction of three seats for Saskatchewan instead of five; at the same time I
realize what a difficult problem this created
in rearranging the constituencies in Saskatchewan.
I have no objection to the new constituency
for the Mackenzie district. It is being created
because of the immense potential val.ue of that
great area and not for any reason of population. This is somewhat different from the
situation in the Yukon, where I understand
the territory is settled only in a few
localities.
An important province like Saskatchewan,
with its immense area and sparse population,
should be treated with as much consideration as possible. I do not need to remind
honourable members of the fact that Saskatchewan is creating wealth of untold value
that flows into the general stream of the
development of Canada. We all know the
main causes of our loss of population in
that province. In addition to our young
men and women who enlisted in the war,
large numbers were attracted to war industries in Quebec and Ontario. And of course
for a long time now there has been a growing
trend towards the use of large machines,
huge combines, on the farm, and this equipment has made it possible for one man to
operate a farm which formerly would have
kept a number of men busy. As a result
of irrigation, and the considerable development in mining and in oil and gas wells which
now seems assured in the north, the trend
to over-large farms may possibly be halted.
I think our province generally will be in a
healthier position if this happens. After all,
the backbone of the nation is a secure farm
home, where enough can be produced to
raise a family in comfort; and I have no
doubt that there is room for a very large
increase in Saskatchewan's population on
that basis.
The bill before us reminds me of a book
that I read with interest long before I ever
thought of entering this chamber-a book
which no doubt many honourable senators
have read. It was entitled "Getting into
Parliament and After," and was written by
George W. Ross, who himself later became a
senator. He was teaching school in Ontario
for a salary of $250 or $300 a year when he
got the idea of contesting a seat in the
House of Commons. It is perhaps fair to
say that the greatest row that this country
ever had about redistribution was when Sir
John Macdonald was accused of "hiving the
Grits." In his book Mr. Ross tells how he
afterwards learned that, prior to the election
campaign in which the famous row broke out,

his opponent in a central Ontario constituency interviewed Sir John and begged him
to take a few townships off one side of the
constituency and add a few on the other
side; but Sir John's reply to this suggestion
was: "You can take a few townships off
here and add a few there, but that little devil
Ross will beat you, anyway, so we might
just as well leave the constituency as it is."
As stated by the acting leader (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), redistribution is a matter that
does not concern the Senate as much as it
does the House of Commons. However, we
perhaps should be concerned to see that the
constituencies are arranged for the convenience of the public, and not for any
candidates in particular. I have not studied
the schedules in detail. So far as my own
local town is concerned, all I can say is
that we have been in the constituency of
Prince Albert, and in Battleford, and back
in Prince Albert, until it has become difficult
to know where our people should vote. The
main consideration when a redistribution
bill is being drafted should be the convenience of the voters in all constituencies.
In so far as this bill fails in that respect,
the government will be taking the responsibility for the failure.
Honourable senators, these are all the
remarks I wish to make at this time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

the latest information which I have been able
to obtain is that the House of Commons is
continuing its ýconsideration of the estimates,
in the hope of being able to complete them
parly this afternoon and put through the
necessary Appropriation Bill, which will then
come before us. The members in the other
place have been sitting since 10 o'clock this
morning, and they have agreed to carry on
their discussions through the lunch hour in
an attempt to conclude their business.
Under these circumstances, perhaps the
best suggestion I can make to the house is
that we should now adjourn during pleasure
to reassemble at the call of the bell, in the
hope and expectation that we shall be called
betWeen 2 and 3 o'clock this afternoon,
although of course I am unable to give any
guarantee to that effect. I would ask honourable senators to be kind enough to remain in
the immediate neighbourhood of this building
ào that they will be able to hear the bell
when it summons us to reassemble.
I move that, the Senate adjourn during
pleasure, to reassemble at the call of the bell.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

The sitting was resumed.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that he had received a communication from
the Secretary to the Governor General
acquainting him that the Honourable Patrick
Kerwin, a Judge of the Supreme Court of
Canada, acting as Deputy of His Excellency
the Governor General, would proceed to the
Senate Chamber today at 4.45 p.m., for the
purpose of giving Royal Assent to certain
bills.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 394, an Act for granting
to Her Majesty certain sums of money for

the public service of the financial year ending the 31st March, 1953.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
financial bill which comes to us at the end
of each session, and although it was passed
by the other place only a few minutes ago,
copies are available on the Table for any
honourable senator who desires to examine
the bill.
I should explain that this is the fourth
Appropriation Bill which this house has been
called upon to pass this session, and it is
the third which provides for moneys necessary to meet the expenses of the public
service of the financial year ending March
31, 1953. The bill, of course, is based upon
the estimates for the current financial year,
which have been in the hands of the members of this house for some months now,
and which have been the subject of considerable and detailed discussion and investigation by the Finance Committee of this
chamber. Honourable senators will therefore be aware of their general purport.
The total asked for by the present bill
is $2,446,317,110.60.
This amount is made
up of the balance of $2,363,584,922.60 of the
main estimates which remains unappropriated at the present time, together with
an additional amount of $82,732,188 provided
in the supplementary estimates which were
tabled in the other place on June 23rd,
copies of which were received by all honourable senators some few days ago.
The bill is in the same form as similar bills
in the past, except for the following deletions
from section 4 of the bill:
First of all authority for the Governor in
Council to pay and redeem treasury bills and
deposit certificates.
That authority is not
now necessary under this bill, because it is
given by section 43 of the Financial Administration Act.
The second change is the deletion of the
reference to a loan being a charge upon and
payable out of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund. That also is now covered under the
Financial Administration Act, and there is
no need to have that reference appearing in
this bill.
I will now explain the bill in very short
detail.
Section 1 is the short title.
Section 2 provides for the balance of the
main estimates, after deducting the amounts

JLt

.f

dlready voted under Appropriation Acts No.

1 and No. 3, which were submitted to and
passed by this body earlier in the session.
This balance amounts to slightly more than
$2 billion, the figure which I have already
given. Details of the main estimates and
their items are set out in schedule A attached
to the bill.
Section 3 provides for the supplementary
estimates, in the total of slightly more than
$82 million, to which I referred a moment
ago.
Section 4 confers upon the Governor in
Council the usual authority to raise from
time to time during the year by way of loan
sums not exceeding $500 million which may
be required for public works and general
purposes.
Section 5 provides that expenditures incurred under the authority of this bill shall
be reported in the public accounts in the
usual manner.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable. senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
